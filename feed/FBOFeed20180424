<DESC><p>The Air Force employs intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) information as a strategic element during peacetime, as a tactical enabler during conflict, and as a life-saver during emergencies and natural disasters.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate (AFRL/RY) includes within its mission the improvement of Air Force ISR capabilities, through both sensor device enhancements and novel processing of sensor data.  Layered sensing is an ISR asset management approach emphasizing mission success through tailored application of platforms, sensors, infrastructure, and analysis capabilities.  Of Air Force interest is the use of layered sensing principles to accommodate multi-domain information sources, to accelerate sensing and analysis, and to enable multiple forms of autonomous systems.  Such development requires basic through advanced research in sensor data processing; expertise in modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A); and software engineering and integration experience.</p>
<p>Over many years the AFRL Advanced Recognition Capability (ARC) Laboratory has been involved in the assessment, demonstration, and integration of mature (Technology Readiness Level 5+) technologies supporting ISR capabilities.  These ARC roles are being expanded to accommodate promising but less-mature (Technology Readiness Level 3-4) technology, focusing their development as appropriate on Air Force missions.  The ARC includes technology that emulates certain operational ISR systems to a degree that enables advanced development and streamlined transition.</p>
<p>The goal of the Sensing, Learning, Autonomy, and Knowledge Engineering (SLAKE) program is to advance Air Force sensing capabilities by employing diverse sensor processing results at a representational or product level that is abstracted from the direct sensing output yet retains crucial information and corresponding uncertainties.  Key research areas under SLAKE include development of sensor product representations suitable for efficient storage, efficient communication, and efficient resource allocation; robust conversion of sensor processing output to novel representation formats; accurate characterization of sensing uncertainties; rigorous incorporation of sensing uncertainties within novel algorithms for sensor resource management, task allocation, and information fusion; development and employment of virtual environments suitable for exercising specific algorithms and for analyzing specific system concepts; and sustained, efficient descriptions of mission context and mission operating environment.  In support of technology maturation and transition, SLAKE also includes small unmanned aerial system (SUAS) integration and operation, advanced demonstration and validation.</p>
<p>SLAKE technology trajectories must be compatible with the constraints of future contested and highly contested operating environments, and with relevant missions and roles.  However, SLAKE research and development must build upon and contribute to a broad technical foundation, and as such requires deliberate experimentation that relaxes and imposes operating constraints consistent with the maturity and specific objectives of each development thread.  The majority of SLAKE efforts will require software development that incorporates modern best practices; furthermore, software development under SLAKE must be compatible with the constraints of Air Force network and computing environments.  SLAKE is expected to employ modern computing architectures and Air Force fielded systems, both of which may require procurement of specialized software and hardware as part of system development and technology transition.</p>
<p>Technology investments under SLAKE are expected to be diverse, drawing upon previous and ongoing government, industry, and academic work in areas including sensor exploitation, machine learning, synthetic data generation, target tracking, information fusion, and modeling and simulation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be required to deliver all hardware, software, and associated data developed and utilized in the development of any resulting contract.  It is anticipated that a BAA providing details into this program will be released in May/June 2018; the BAA will be made available at www.fbo.gov. Other business opportunities for AFRL are also available at www.fbo.gov. Any questions may be directed to the contracting or technical points of contact listed in the announcement.</p>

The estimated period of performance for this effort is 01 June 2018 through 31 May 2023.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This requirement is for expertise, analysis, production, research, development, and process support to the Technical Electronic Intelligence (TechELINT) Branch (IANG-STS-TE) of the U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) in every aspect of Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) and EWIR Database (EWIRDB) production. This effort will require the Contractor to provide a wholly self-contained, end-to-end, EWIR IMD production process using the Next Generation EWIRDB (NGES) construct and associated toolsets. The Contractor shall perform specific tasks in the areas of information gathering, data reduction, signals analysis, engineering assessment, product preparation and production process enhancement that shall support NGIC's efforts to accomplish nationally mandated EWIR production and enable NGIC's TechELINT Branch to realize significant improvements in production quantity, quality, and efficiency.</p>
<p>During the contract period, NGIC personnel will identify Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Database (EWIRDB) production tasks and the Contracting Office will negotiate and issue individual task orders to the Contractor to complete them. Additionally, the contract will allow basic research into advanced electronic, electro-optic, and weapon system technologies. Based upon these technical, engineering, and analytical examinations, the contractor shall prepare technical reports, create and maintain EWIR IMD models, and submit regular status reports. Such reports may include results of test measurements, engineering judgments, technology assessments, signals analyses, and conclusions of devices' operability and/or operational effectiveness. Results are usually held at the SECRET level, but may be at a higher level classification.</p>
<p>Performance requires a TOP SECRET contractor facility clearance. Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be U.S. Citizens, have a final TOP SECRET clearance with a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), and shall be eligible for indoctrination to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level. Some positions may require a Polygraph examination if additional accesses are required. The contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary security clearances for contractor personnel. This TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance requirement may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. The place of performance is at government facilities in Charlottesville, Virginia and at contractor facilities.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541330. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. No solicitation document exists. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish information concerning their capabilities to provide the services sought, which will be considered.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the availability of future sources for this requirement.</p>

<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email LeeAnn.Carpenter@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of open source intelligence (OSINT) services for multiple simultaneous connections/locations.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO Internatioal Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-NCIA-JISR-18-05, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities">http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</a></p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), intends to award a sole source contract to Cision US, 130 E. Randolph St., 7th Floor, Chicago, IL 60601-6164 to procure&nbsp;services for a media monitoring, tracking and analysis on-line data-base retrieval service and the composition of professional quantitative reports upon request. The on-line database is a nationwide media database portal for all media types that tracks and monitors media coverage for traditional news (print, e-news, internet, broadcast (TV and radio), which is inclusive of North America's small towns and social media (blogs, Twitter).<br />&nbsp;
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 519190, All Other Information Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 60 months.</p>
<p>Currently, the Office of Communication assists the various divisions with media lists (print, radio and TV) targeted to particular audiences for distribution of their materials, in addition to tracking the media coverage on division-related topics. CDC's increased emphasis on demonstrating the outcomes and impacts of its interventions, combined with an overall environment of increased government accountability underscores the need for a system to provide quantitative data on the results of our media outreach efforts. These data will provide a critical measure of the reach and exposure of NCCDPHP's key messages among the American public. This information will also help the Center's health communicators improve their strategies and tactics in working with the news media in the most efficient and effective way possible.</p>
<p>The Office of Communications/NCCDPHP explored a web-based operating system to meet the needs of this project. After market research, there was only one contractor found that could provide the detailed data required to meet all the communication needs across the center and that was Vocus. They were awarded the contract in 2013. Cision was in the running, but lacked the ability to provide broadcast/radio metrics. However, the two contractors Vocus and Cision merged into one entity which is now known as "Cision US, Inc." This merge took place during this current performance period August 2017-July 2018. Initially, Vocus was awarded the contract based solely on the fact that they could provide broadcast/radio metrics. This capability was carried over to the newly formed company "Cision US, Inc." when the merger took place. Cision US., Inc. is the only company with all the technical capabilities that meets all the specifications outlined in the performance work statement. Therefore, based on market research and the understanding of the market, Cision US, Inc. is the only company that possesses the technical capabilities and the level of quality required to fulfill the contract needs for a successful project.</p>
<p>In addition, through much collaboration over the years and working diligently with the vendor, there have been many customizations made to the system to produce a final product of deliverables that are in alignment with NCCDPHP's operations and needs. Customizations consists of: retrieval of center-related data-Input of assigned topic-related search terms for each division-critical to the systems output of accurate metrics; media outlet search lists created for specific searches such as the "Today's News"; media outlet search list associated with specific states on the topic of "Marijuana." There have been customized upgrades to Cision's database that all divisions can benefit from. They have expanded their broadcast monitoring content to include Gray Television broadcast. They own and/or operate over 90 stations across 50+ markets in the US, including 90+ affiliates of the Big Four Networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX). This is paramount for the divisions, because publicity value metrics for broadcast/radio coverage is much broader now and inclusive of affiliates. There also has recently been an upgrade to the format structure providing better usability and better visual reporting.</p>
<p>Factoring in all of these elements that need to be considered, it would be advantageous to the government monetarily to procure the same vendor. We do not want to lose the metrics for broadcast/radio and the customizations that have already been made and paid for (resulting in the final product being generated with accurate data presented in a format that is acceptable for various tasks). Cision US is the only vendor that can provide broadcast/radio metrics that is needed to meet the requirements of the contract. In addition, Cision US has shown consistency in the accuracy of data and timely production of deliverables. So much time, effort and collaboration with vendor has been spent to customize the system to produce what is needed for the different tasks associated with the 9 divisions across the center and the Office of Associate Director for Communications (OADC), it would not be cost effective to the government in labor hours if a different vendor was procured considering all the adjustments that would have to be re-established with a new vendor. This product is an excellent product with a broad range of options and functionality a "one-stop-shop." This Cision system fulfills all of the requirements that meets the center-wide communication needs and allows users to get the access and data they need to gain a better understanding of who is covering key messages and campaigns. Consequently, analysis of this information can aid in making improvements in the outreach tactics.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Cision US. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 75D301-18-R-67862 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN May 9, 2018.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<RESPDATE>050918
<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to GlaxoSmithKline, 5 Moore Dr Research Triangle Pk, Durham, NC, 27709, to store and rotate pediatric vaccines in a national pediatric stockpile for use in the event of a disease outbreak or vaccine shortage. The period of performance for this acquistion will be a base period of 12 months with four 12 month option periods.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline is the only vendor with a market large enough to rotate older stockpiled vaccines into operating inventory before expiration and replace them in order to maintain a viable stockpile. Contracting with the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, to store and rotate these stockpiled vaccines is the only alternative to keep CDC's purchased vaccines viable for use year after year, and maintain the stockpile in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Recent market research on manufacturer specific vaccines revealed multiple distributors capable of storing stockpile vaccines but none capable of rotating the vaccines. Without the capability for an organization to rotate the vaccines into the market and then replace those rotated vaccines with fresh vaccines, it could not most efficiently and effectively manage CDC's pediatric vaccine stockpile program. GlaxoSmithKline is the only company which has exclusive capabilities to store and rotate their own vaccines without the Government having to make additional purchases.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Liubov Kriel, Contracting Specialist, Reference 75D301-18-R-67860, via e-mail at vyh1@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the GlaxoSmithKline as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<RESPDATE>050818
<CONTACT>Orlando V. Holloway, Phone 8042796740, Email orlando.holloway@dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to support DLA's Strategic 2.0 Captains of Industry (COI) LTC Initiative. This strategic effort includes multiple NSNs to support various sole sourced weapon systems / operational platforms. A total of 121 NSNs for the H-60 platform / weapon system are targeted for this RFP and contract action. OEM Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PHC) (59211) has been identified as the approved source of supply for the listed items; therefore, the proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to the OEM. It is anticipated that 121 items will be awarded and priced with lead-times as add-ons to PHC's existing LTCs: SPE4AX-14-D-9413 (Next-Generation / Non-Commercial) and SPE4AX-17-D-9412 (Commercial).
<p><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLA Procurement Note 04, Government Surplus Property Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: DLA Procurement Note M05 Evaluation Factor for Unused Former Government Surplus Property will apply and other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus documentation, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items in accordance with the aforementioned acquisition strategy. In addition, respondents should identify the available quantities, prices, and lead-times. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Tuesday, May 08, 2018. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (michael.a.massello@sba.gov).</p>
<p><br />If your company desires to be reviewed and qualified as an "Approved Source" for any of the items listed, submit an application package through the Source Approval Request (SAR) Program as outlined in the attached SAR document. A SAR package contains all of the technical data needed to demonstrate that the prospective contractor can competently manufacture the product to the same level of quality, or better, than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The onus is on the contractor to document and demonstrate their product is equal to, or better, than the currently approved item which DLA Aviation is procuring. (Note: All SAR's will need to be submitted on a Compact Disc (CD). DLA Aviation, Richmond does not accept SAR's via email. An information page from our website and Industry Day SAR slides are also attached. Current procurements will not be held pending review; therefore, any actions will be for future procurements or strategic efforts).</p>
<p><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). FAR Parts 12 / 15 procedures may apply. The attached 121 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by this strategic initiative and contract terms, they will be synopsized separately. The anticipated closing date is Thursday, May 24, 2018.</p>

<DESC>B-GRID BOISE FOREST INVENTORY
<p>The Forest Service proposes to contract for technical forestry services to conduct the field phase of a stand exam project.  The inventory exam will provide the Government with natural resource information for forested lands at an intensity required for forest inventory and Forest-wide land management decisions.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supervision, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), incidentals, and perform all work necessary to conduct inventory examinations in compliance with terms, specifications, conditions, and provisions of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Location and Description</p>
<p>The project consists of 4-plot cluster settings at selected timberland locations on the Boise National Forest.  Settings that will be sampled have been pre-selected by the Government.  The Supervisor's Office is located in Boise Idaho.  The project area is located on all ranger districts of the Forest.</p>
<p>1.	Item Nos. 1 contain  timberland sample plots at  settings.  This consists of measuring 4 plots per setting using inventory procedures.  All plots are fixed radius plots with a 24 foot radius.  Within each plot there is also a 1/300th acre microplot.  Measurements will be taken and recorded electronically or recorded on paper forms and entered electronically, using the Forest Service data format and programs which will be provided.  Item Nos. 1a  are inaccessible settings because of permanent physical conditions.  See C.2 Technical Specifications.  The price for inaccessible settings will be a separate pay item.</p>
<p>2.	For each setting, there are three 120 foot line transects to take data following Brown's planar intercept method for down, woody material.  Only data for material &ge;3.0 inches will be recorded.  Each transect will be a straight line that starts at the outer edge of plot 1 and extends through the center of plot 2, plot 3 and plot 4 to the outer boundary of the respective plot.</p>
<p>3.	The contract consists of locating, measuring and recording data for each sample plot beginning with plot number one at each setting.</p>
<p>4.	At all setting centers, the latitude/longitude coordinates will be taken in a ddd&deg;mm'ss.s format using a GPS unit.  The coordinates will be recorded electronically on the plot form.</p>
<p>5.	Digital photographs will be taken at each setting center in the 4 cardinal directions.  The photograph will be taken as a level, straight forward shot using a 30-40 mm lens.  The photographs will be submitted electronically with a minimum of 2.1 megapixels.  Each photo file must be labeled with the district number, setting number and direction person was facing when taking the photograph.  For example, district=4, setting=2039301, taken facing east would be "42039301E". See BGrid Field Guide Chapter 4, item D: Photographing the Setting Location.</p>
<p>6.	A site list of settings to be surveyed is included in Exhibit 2, Summary Information Chart.</p>
<p>7.	A vicinity map for the Forest is included in the attached exhibits.  Maps of approximate setting locations will be provided at the pre-work conference.</p>
<p>8.	Copies of the Boise National Forest BGRID Inventory Field Guide (referred to as the Field Guide in the remainder of this document) will be provided at the pre-work conference.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, next generation sequencing services to analyze viruses present in tumor samples from Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.
<p>The response close date of the notice for this requirement is in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1). This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1); and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 622310 and the business size standard is $38.5M.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>The anticipated award shall be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire services to identify viruses present in tumor tissues by utilizing next generation sequencing.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall receive the tumor specimens shipped to them by the Iowa and Hawaii state cancer registries. There will be up to 30 ALCL (Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma), 5 DLBCL (Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma), and 5 breast cancer cases. The Contractor shall be blinded to the type of tumor tissue for sequencing and analyses. The Contractor shall purify and quantify the total RNA from the tumor tissue using RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's instructions. The Contractor shall then determine the integrity of the RNA using the 2100 Bioanalyzer System (Agilent).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare the total RNA sequencing libraries using the NEBNext&reg; Ultra<sup>TM</sup> Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina&reg; (New England Biolabs) per manufacturer's instructions. The Contractor shall pool the samples following library quantification using the KAPA Library Quantification Kits for Next-Generation Sequencing (KAPA Biosystems) and library insert size visualization using the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent). The Contractor shall sequence the total RNAseq libraries on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform in "Rapid Run" mode using 100 bp paired end sequencing, with 6 samples per lane. These methods have been previously used in next generation sequencing to isolate RNA from tumor tissue and successfully identify novel organisms in human diseases.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use the algorithm from the PathSeq software to perform computational subtraction of human reads, followed by alignments of residual reads to human reference transcriptomes and microbial reference genomes (which include bacterial, viral, archaeal, and fungal sequences). The contractor shall use these alignments and perform taxonomical classification of the residual reads as bacterial, viral, archaeal, and fungal sequences from total RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data. The contractor shall deposit the reads from novel micro-organisms into "unmapped reads" for further analysis. The PathSeq software has been used successfully to identify novel micro-organisms that are associated with several human diseases. The method using PathSeq is the best way to identify microorganisms in ALCL tissue samples for our proposed study.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall report the findings to the NCI on an ongoing basis as the sequencing and analyses of each case is completed. The frequency of reports will depend upon how many tumor tissue samples we are able to send to the Lab at a time. report the findings of the analyses every month in an electronic format, such as Microsoft word or excel document attached to an email.</p>

<p>One year from the date of award.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The service shall be conducted at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>REPORT(S)/DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall report the findings to the NCI on an ongoing basis as the sequencing and analyses of each case is completed.

<p><br />A Solicitation will NOT be posted to FedBizOpps due to its sole source nature. The draft agreement will be issued directly to the Harris Corporation.</p>
<p>This effort was previously synopsized as N00164-17-R-JT22 and is hereby amended to the following:</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, has a requirement to award a five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for the USQ-149 System to include the individual Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs), Support Equipment, Special Tools and Tooling, Packaging and Handling Equipment, Test Equipment, and applicable System Software/Firmware. Efforts will include but not be limited to Repair/Rework/and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification, Training, Data Collection, Logistics Support Services, Firmware/Software Engineering, and Travel as required. . Job Orders shall be within scope, issued within ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of approximately $8,000,000 over a five-year period. Each Job Order will be synopsized. The first order against the BOA is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENT 0001 - The Government has a requirement for and intends to procure lay-in spares (Pedestal Control Assembly (P/N 198410-01), DC-DC Converter (P/N M8149-8), PBA Pedestal Control (P/N 198420-01A1), EEPROM Parallel 256K Bit (P/N AT28C256E-25LM/883), IC, DSP, PQFP-176 (P/N SM320F2812PGFMEP), and FPGA 300 K Gates 180 MHz (P/N APA300BG456M) as well as repair of TN-340 Tuners (P/N 143200-01), Antenna Control Unit s(ACUs)(P/N 198400-01), and MD-128 Demodulator (P/N 126120-01) through a Job Order placed against the BOA, N0016418GJV13, and shall be within the scope, issued within the ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of that BOA.</strong></p>
<p>The proposed agreement is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Harris Corporation, Van Nuys, CA, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source). The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this draft agreement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Harris Corporation directly</p>

Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS. LOCKHEED MARTIN IS THE DESIGN AGENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND THE NAVSEA APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND CERTIFIED DEPOT FOR THE AN/UYQ-70(V) WEAPON SYSTEM. NAVSUP WSS DOES NOT POSSESS THE NECESSARY ENGINEERING DRAWING MASTERS, DEVELOPMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS, ENGINEERING CHANGE DATA, INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS, ETC. REQUIRED TO SOURCE THESE PARTS TO ANOTHER VENDOR OTHER THAN LOCKHEED MARTIN. NAVSUPWSS DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED NAVY TECHNICAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY (TSA) OR IN-SERVICE ENGINEERING SUPPORT APPROVAL TO PARTS PROCURED OR REPAIRED BY SOURCES OTHER THAN LOCKHEED MARTIN. ADDITIONAL INTERESTED VENDORS ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SOURCE APPROVAL PRIOR TO ANY OFFERS BEING CONSIDERED FOR THE CURRENT PROPOSED AWARD. IF INTERESTED IN PROCEEDING WITH SOURCE APPROVAL YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CONTACT THE BUYER AT MELANIE.MORRIS@DLA.MIL ADVISING OF INTEREST AND THE NAVSUPWSS MECHANICSBURG SOURCE APPROVAL REQUEST PROCEDURES WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU. THE RESULTANT AWARD WILL BE MADE ON AN ALL OR NOTHING BASIS TO THE OFFEROR SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICED, TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE OFFER.

The proposer shall submit all requested information specified in the proposal. There will be no public opening of the proposals received as a result of this solicitation.&nbsp; <br /><br />DO NOT submit requests for the proposals to the federal agency personnel. See Obtaining Solicitation Documents below.&nbsp; <br /><br />Project Description: <br />a. Preparing plans and specifications to replace all components of the station service switchgear to include exterior electrical switchgear, a zig zag transformer, a voltage regulator, relaying and metering for all three station service connections and replacement of a switchyard auxiliary power transformer and associated panelboards. The current limiting reactor will be removed and not replaced since new vacuum circuit breakers that have sufficient interrupt ratings for the available fault current can be purchased. <br /><br />b. The components will be purchased, assembled, and tested off-site by a contractor. It is anticipated that the equipment will take six to eight months to assemble and test.&nbsp; <br /><br />c. The station service switchgear will be specified with a single line-up in its own weather-proof enclosure and will be tested at the factory to minimize issues in the field during installation and field testing. We are also going to specify the cubicles of the individual breakers to match the existing switchgear line-up dimensionally as much as possible so that the existing 15 kV feeder cables can be reused in place without a lot of rerouting.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />d. The equipment will be transported and installed on-site by the contractor. <br /><br />e. The installation is dependent upon station service outages. Outages will have to be taken, but there are alternate sources of power to all the loads served so it should not be a problem for scheduling construction. The equipment cannot be installed in one outage. The outage schedule will be provided to the contractor, and they will identify a plan for the installation. <br /><br />f. All old equipment will be removed and disposed at contractor expense

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center, on behalf of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC), intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates, S.C., Oak Lawn, IL, for after-hours on-call Cardiac Surgeon coverage and clinic services. The anticipated period of performance will be July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.. The contractor shall provide 24/7 on-call cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon services to the FHCC and one, two-hour clinic per week, as well as other elective surgical procedures for the FHCC. Providers are required to be board certified cardiovascular surgeons or board certified cardiothoracic surgeons trained in cardiovascular surgery. The on-call provider shall contact the FHCC within 15 minutes of being notified to provide assessment of the patient s condition. Should the patient s condition require the physical presence of the on-call provider, they shall report to the FHCC within 30 minutes of being notified. The contractor shall also come to the FHCC when necessary to make rounds and document in the electronic medical record their treatment as well as follow up on results from diagnostic studies (labs, imaging, etc.,) and medications that have been ordered or require follow up. Contractor shall be available to the FHCC to perform or assist in thoracic and vascular procedures on appropriate cases either at the FHCC or an off-site facility. All patient consults and new admissions will be seen within 24 hours or sooner as required by the patient s clinical condition. These services require more than one provider to be performing under the contract. Additionally, individual physicians are not allowed to provide concurrent on-call services to the FHCC and another entity. 
To the best of our knowledge, Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates (CVSA) is the only company that is able to provide uninterrupted on-call services to the FHCC. Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates, S.C. has Board Certified Cardiac Surgeons who are currently credentialed and privileged at the FHCC and have an adjudicated Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI) Background Investigation. Additionally, these surgeons hold clinical privileges at an off-site facility where cardiac surgeries that cannot be performed at the FHCC may be performed without a break in treatment as the CVSA surgeons can assess the patient s condition at the FHCC and perform the surgical procedure at an off-site facility.  
The authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government s minimum needs can be best satisfied by services available from one source. The NAICS code for this requirement is 621111.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it is capable of performing these services, the following information must be provided to the Contracting Officer:
CV/Resume of proposed physicians
Copies of providers  licenses and any certifications (BLS/ACLS)
Description of the company s background and capability to perform the required services.  Include an explanation and example a potential call schedule.
Hourly Rate for Weekday on-call services.
Hourly Rate for Weekend on-call services.
Hourly Rate for Call-back services.
Identification of off-site facility(s) where providers hold clinical privileges to perform surgeries. 
Proof of completed ANACI for proposed providers or statement indicating all providers will submit to ANACI Background Investigation.
This information must be submitted via email to benjamin.dufour by 1:00 p.m. Central Time, Tuesday, May 1, 2018. Supporting documentation must be furnished with sufficient detail to demonstrate the contractor s ability to comply with the above requirements.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition, based upon responses received, is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates, S.C.

The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 336419 which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1000 Employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in any business, including all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Please provide a brief description of how the limitations listed in section 3.b below will be overcome in order to meet the Government's requirement listed in section 3.a below. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Program Details:</p>
<p>A. REQUIREMENT.</p>
<p>(1) The Operator Chair Assembly, P/N 1144-1C, NSN 1430-01-483-0850, consists of a chair assembly that is used by Air Force Personnel in the Launch Control Center. The chair must be able to travel along the rails on the Launch Control Center floor. It must safely contain Air Force Personnel and allow them to perform their required duties.</p>
<p>(2) The Operator Chair Assembly must be manufactured to the dimensions and requirements of drawing 1144-1 and related sub-drawings.</p>
<p>(3) The Government currently estimates 20 Operator Chair Assemblies are needed to satisfy the current spares requirement. There are no other future projected quantities at this time.</p>
<p>B. LIMITATIONS. <br />The Government does not have drawing data rights from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Government has no other engineering data and/or data rights related to this synopsis. No drawings or data can be provided to interested vendors.</p>
<p>In addition the Government does not have sufficient data or rights to be able to independently evaluate and qualify potential manufacturing sources to maintain the Operator Chair Assembly Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E). Prior to requesting Government approval, companies interested in becoming an approved Government manufacturing source should first obtain Operator Chair Assembly Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), AMI Industries, Inc. (CAGE 31218), authorization/certification to accomplish manufacturing and testing. If OEM authorization is not received, the company seeking Government source approval will need to clearly identify how the company will overcome the lack of Government data/rights and maintain the Operator Chair Assembly OSS&amp;E in order to potentially allow Government qualification independent of the OEM authorization/certification.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: <br />Interested parties are requested to submit the following information to assist the Government in developing the acquisition strategy. Please submit this information to the contracting specialist via email as soon as possible but not later than 11 May 2018:</p>
<p>(1) Basic Company Information:<br />Company Representative<br />Address<br />Telephone<br />Email Address<br />DUNS Number<br />CAGE Code and/or Tax ID Number<br />Socioeconomic Status (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, etc.)</p>
<p>(2) White Paper. Please provide a brief White Paper describing the company capabilities for the following (to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, please include similar information for those vendors or subcontractors too):<br />(a) Manufacturing, repairing, testing, trouble shooting, and component part support, of the Operator Chair Assembly.<br />(b) Past production experience, supplying Operator Chair Assembly parts, testing knowledge and capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals.<br />(c) If an interested party anticipates a teaming arrangement, please describe the teaming arrangement.<br />(d) Please provide a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers within the last three years.<br />(e) Please provide documentation identifying manufacture authorization/certification from the Operator Chair Assembly OEM or how the lack of Government data/rights will be overcome such that the Government could accomplish independent source qualification.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This Sources Sought does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished and responding to this request in no way guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent. The information provided is to the best of the Government's knowledge of plans, desires, and general situation as it exists at the time of the Sources Sought Synopsis. This requirement is in the planning phase and, therefore, all information is subject to change.</p>
<p><br />Submission Instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice. Responses must be received or postmarked no later than close of business 11 May 2018.</p>

<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>1. Universal Armament Interface (UAI) was initially developed by the United States Air Force (USAF) and defines a standardized specification and method of integrating MIL-STD-1760, AS5725 Miniature Mission Store Interface (MMSI) and AS5726 Interface for Micro Munitions (IMM) guided weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) update cycles. The primary components of UAI include Interface Control Documents (ICD), Certification Compliance Plans (CCP), system integration lab Certification Tool (CT) hardware and software, Launch Acceptability Region (LAR) documents, tools and processes, and Mission Planning software and certification tool. Performance includes software design &amp; development, testing &amp; formal qualification of weapon system requirements, and technical &amp; engineering analysis &amp; generation of logical interface specifications; configuration control &amp; management of all software &amp; technical documents will be required; maintenance and sustainment of certification tool hardware and software. Performance also includes the UAI Super Joint Interface Control Working Group (SJICWG) Secretariat function &amp; technical support for the UAI Program Office in accordance with the UAI Interface Control Plan (UAI ICP-R02).</p>
<p>2. UAI Program Office Support -- Provide support to individual platform/store program offices in their efforts toward integration of UAI requirements into their specific Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission Planning components. This support will be situational and will depend on need and a request from the Program Office for such support. Support may be provided at all phases of an OFP program, domestic and/or international, including requirements definition and generation, system development and demonstration, and system testing and fielding.</p>
<p>3. Working group, integrated product team, documentation and governance support -- Provide Platform/Store (PS) and Mission Planning (MP) Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and Launch Acceptable Region Data Package (LARDP) Super Joint Interface Control Working Group (SJICWG) support, to consist of secretariat functions utilizing and managing a secure website provided by the Government, providing key technical support in generating proposed changes or additions to the PSICD, MPICD, and LAR documents and associated Compliance Certification Plans (CCPs), as well as providing partial support from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) programs not currently funded for UAI implementation to participate in SJICWG activities. All SJICWG support will follow the specified processes outlined in the UAI Interface Control Plan (ICP).</p>
<p>4. Risk Reduction Studies -- Perform Risk Reduction studies as requested for incorporation of follow on interface requirements into current UAI development efforts. Follow on interface requirements are considered to be those functional and logical interfaces that are outside the scope of current UAI development efforts. This effort will include technical reports and presentations documenting potential identified candidates, feasibility, trade studies, as well as roadmaps and plans for incorporating interfaces from these systems or technologies into the UAI program. For those interfaces or technologies deemed feasible for near-term inclusion into UAI, draft Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and associated draft Interface Change Notices (ICNs) will be generated with respect to the appropriate PSICD, MPICD, and LAR core documents. The draft ECPs/ICNs will either be incorporated into UAI core documents through formal SJICWG processes, or will otherwise be refined during follow on, full development efforts to address and incorporate these interfaces into UAI.</p>
<p>5. UAI Development Tools - Universal implementation of the UAI requirements across a multitude of platforms and store programs has been facilitated by use of common development tools developed and provided by the UAI Program Office. Successful contractors will be required to provide continued support of these development tools, including but not limited to: (a) UAI Certification Tool (CT): Update all Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs, currently including the Mission Planning CT, Universal Store Simulator (USS), and Universal Platform Simulator (UPS)) to be current with ICD revisions and (b) Updates to the LAR Toolset.</p>
<p>6. Provide engineering, software programming, source code writing, and program management services and products to maintain and advance the Universal Armament Interface (UAI). Performance will include analysis of requests for change in the areas of platform-store logical interfaces, mission planning systems' proprietary software interoperability &amp; launch acceptability region algorithms. The product of the analysis will be published Universal Armament Interface changes, certification compliance plans, mission planning software and development &amp; test software to enable certification compliance across all elements of UAI.</p>

The paper must include company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; business size, unique qualifiers (e.g. large, foreign, small disadvantage, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.). <br />The Government acknowledges its obligation under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response-see item 3 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, identify where the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins and where the proprietary portion ends.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Point of Contact, nathalie.c.nguyen.civ@mail.mil. Verbal questions will not be accepted.

<p>III. Synopsis:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's (DoS), Bureau Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), is seeking information pertaining to potential sources interested in, and capable of, providing services under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220 for its newly combined Forced Entry/Ballistic Resistant (FE/BR) and Anti-Ram Gates &amp; Barriers (ARGB) Program. The primary focus of the work will involve the installation, repair, maintenance and replacement of FE/BR and ARGB products - e.g., doors, windows, opaque panels, glazing panels vault doors, crash fence systems, shallow mount bollards, wedge barriers, vertical lift barriers, multi-purpose entry drop-arms and anti-ram crash gates - that may include, but is not limited to, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, and structural, blast, fire life-safety, physical and technical security upgrades and other directly related work.</p>
<p>Potential construction services will include the provision of professional engineering services, plus construction labor and materials to execute Design/Build (D/B) projects. Construction services will further include on-site supervision to ensure project coordination and control throughout the life of the project. Contractor proposal prices for potential future RFPs (if this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards), shall thereby include all labor, materials, equipment and services necessary to accomplish the design and construction required by the contract documents - to include applicable customs duties, transportation to the site, storage, premiums for insurance and required bonds; and/or the contract documents, permits, license and inspection fees, taxes, and all other items called for by the contract or otherwise necessary for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>IV. Place of Performance:</p>
<p>Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) at U.S. Embassy and Consulate posts worldwide (if this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards).</p>
<p>PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Projects managed under this program require selected offerors to perform both Architect/Engineering (A/E) and construction services that comply with all federal statutes, and in many cases international local laws that will flow-down to the terms and conditions of both the base IDIQ contract and individual Task Orders (TO).</p>
<p>V. Contract Type: <br /><br />The DoS anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts from the issuance of RFPs in early Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. These IDIQs will serve to replace the current DoS FE/BR Program's IDIQs (all due to expire at various points throughout the summer of 2019), and will be referred to as the "FE/BR II Program" herein.</p>
<p>In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards, DoS will utilize the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Process (as governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation's (FAR) Subpart 36.3) to select qualified and credentialed contractors for the FE/BR II Program.</p>
<p>The duration of each potential IDIQ contract will include one (l) base year, plus four (4) option years. Subsequent to IDIQ contract awards, at the conclusion of Phase II of the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection process, all work will be specified in the form of Task Orders (TO). Each potential TO will be:</p>
<p>1. Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) in nature;</p>
<p>2. Competed upon issuance of Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) among qualified contractors pursuant to FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(1) - Orders under multiple-award contracts; Fair Opportunity; and</p>
<p>3. Awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.101-2 - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process.</p>
<p>In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards, the total range of work on which each potential offeror may be invited to bid on each contract base and option year, is anticipated to be between $25 million and $30 million.</p>
<p>If this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of RFPs, only the top ten (10) most qualified, experienced and credentialed offerors possessing 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) socio-economic status with the Small Business Administration (SBA), will be eligible and selected as Phase I pre-qualified vendors.</p>
<p>Additionally, interested business entities should either be integrated D/B organizations with A/E and construction capabilities, or the ability to subcontract with A/E firms and/or specialized niche industry firms (e.g., for ARGB work) in accordance with the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) status subcontracting rules. Firms that have combined specialties to form Joint Ventures (JV) - as authorized by the SBA - will also be welcomed to participate in the Phase I pre-qualification process.</p>

<p>Please note that all RFP dates will be subject to change, and any change will be posted via FedBizOpps. It therefore will be the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this Government Point of Entry (GPE) for any information pertaining to this Sources Sought/RFI notice or future solicitations.</p>
<p>VII. Special Requirements:</p>
<p>(1)Potential offerors must possess 8(a) Business Development Program (BD), HUBZone, and/or WOSB entity status with the SBA; or be a qualified and authorized JV with a business entity that falls into any of aforementioned small business socio-economic categories - per the SBA authorization and approval.</p>

<p>(4)Past Performance: In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of Phase I RFPs, potential offerors submitting information for Phase I pre-qualification consideration will address the following criteria in the proposal to provide design and construction services:</p>
<p>a.To demonstrate performance of similar construction work for Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 purposes, potential offerors will need to provide information demonstrating that they have successfully completed, in the United States or at a U.S. diplomatic or consular mission, a construction contract or subcontract involving work of the same general type and complexity as the solicited project and having a contract or subcontract value of at least $250,000.00. The value of the construction contract or subcontract offered to demonstrate performance will not be adjusted for inflation, currency fluctuation, or any other market forces.<br />(5) Security Concerns: In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of Phase I RFPs, potential offerors submitting information for Phase I pre-qualification consideration will address the following criteria in the proposal to provide design and construction services:</p>
<p>b. Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.

If a JV is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Submissions from potential offerors that do not receive a pass rating in this area will not be further evaluated. Sufficient information should be provided in the Certifications and attachments thereto to determine eligibility under Public Law 99-399, but the Department reserves the right to consider information available from other sources, or to obtain clarifications or additional information from the potential offeror.</p>
<p>c. IMPORTANT NOTE: Firms that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related firms, must do so by way of a JV. A prospective offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal JV (where the arrangement among the co-venturers has been reduced to writing), or "de facto" JV (where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. person firm that guarantees performance). To be considered a "qualified United States JV person," every JV must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. The U.S. person co-venturer will be required to sign a guarantee making the U.S person individually responsible for performance of any contract awarded, notwithstanding the terms of any JV agreement.</p>
<p>d. Security Clearance Requirements. In order to be eligible to perform under any contract resulting from this Sources Sought/RFI notice, the pre-qualified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a JV and the JV itself, must possess or be able to obtain a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.

<p>e. If an otherwise potential pre-qualified offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, The DoS will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time the offeror is determined to be pre-qualified. The DoS will allow 120 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of the Phase II RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. DoS sponsorship does not guarantee that the potential offeror will receive the FCL, or that it will be received within the 120-day period. The government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.</p>
<p>i. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: The successful offeror selected for contract award will have to possess or obtain an Information System (IS) approved by DSS for processing classified information up to the Secret level. Performance on future contracts resulting from this Sources Sought/RFI will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C system for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS approved classified IS for processing classified information</p>
<p>ii. PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE: ProjNet is a web service, mandated by the DoS, which allows the secure exchange of design and construction information among authorized business partners. DoS will grant pre-qualified contractors access to the system in Phase II of the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Process.</p>
<p>(6) All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the DoS to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>

<p>(7) Contractor personnel (to include A/E partners and subcontractors) requiring access to classified information domestically must possess Secret facility and personnel clearances.</p>
<p>(8) At overseas locations, contractors requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances prior to deployment to the site.</p>
<p>NOTE: Specific security clearance requirements will be delineated at the TO level. Some TOs will require the contractor to provide Top Secret cleared personnel eligible for COMSEC/crypto access.</p>
<p>(9) TOs must be bonded at a 100% of the TO amount. Irrevocable Letters of Credit (ILOCs) will be acceptable for individual TOs in lieu of surety bonding. ILOCs will be required for and in the amount of each individual TO.</p>
<p>IIX. Additional Information Requirements</p>
<p>Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements in response to this Sources Sought/RFI.</p>
<p>NOTE: The attached SOW is a "DRAFT" (Attachment 1) and may change if an RFP is issued - however, the core requirements will not change.

<CONTACT>Katie Hutton, Contracting Officer, Phone 8163081735, Email katie.hutton@gsa.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br /> <br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Heartland Acquisition Center (HAC) is seeking contractor's input on the best solution for providing  supplies and/or logistics operations solutions support for low quantity and/or low dollar value purchase orders. GSA has a number of National Stock Number (NSN) items in which our sources of supply and contractors have Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) requirements. The purchase orders that come through GSA from our customers with a quantity less than the MOQ are currently not able to be filled for our customers.  The MOQ in most cases is $25 but can vary and be higher depending on the item, acquisition center and vendor requirements.  This issue applies to GSA's government customers both inside the continental U.S. (CONUS) and outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS).  In some instances customers may require expedited shipment or special shipping overseas. GSA's goal, through this potential requirement, is to fulfill customer orders of low quantity and dollar value in an expeditious manner.<br /> <br />The NSN's are managed by three regional acquisition centers procuring different types of items:<br />&#9642;          Region 2 New York- Office Supplies and Furniture<br />&#9642;          Region 6 Kansas City- Tools<br />&#9642;          Region 7 Ft. Worth- General Supplies<br />Spreadsheets are attached which list the items affected (Attachments 2 and 3).
<p>We have divided the requirement into two parts (Part A and Part B) in order to gain feedback on both requirements separately.  However, there is a potential that both parts could be combined and we are looking for feedback on combining the two as well. The potential scope and description are identified below. GSA is seeking industry feedback on this scope, feasibility and other aspects of the potential requirements.<br /> <br />Part A- Fulfill orders for approximately 1,150 NSN's (Attachment 2) that are historically more frequently ordered at low quantities or dollar values.  This would require the contractor to manufacture or find a source of supply for items that meet the NSN's Item Purchase Description (IPD) salient characteristics, package, mark, label, and ship to CONUS and OCONUS customer locations.<br /> <br />Part B- Fulfill orders for approximately 6,130 NSN's (Attachment 3) that are historically either seldom ordered or very infrequently ordered at low quantities or dollar values. The list has examples of items we may need.  As our customers submit orders, we'd ideally want the ability to pass that on to a contractor to source the item, even if it that NSN isn't pre-priced on the contract.  This would require the contractor to manufacture or find a source of supply for items that meet the NSN's Item Purchase Description (IPD) salient characteristics, package, mark, label, and ship to CONUS and OCONUS customer locations.<br /> <br />Included in this RFI package are the following documents:<br />&middot;         Request for Information<br />&middot;         Attachment 1: Questionnaire<br />&middot;         Attachment 2: Part A NSN Spreadsheet<br />&middot;         Attachment 3: Part B NSN Spreadsheet<br /> <br />Attachments 1 and 2 should be filled out and returned electronically via email to katie.hutton@gsa.gov.  The RFI closes Wednesday, May 23rd at 4:30pm CDT, please be sure to get your responses in before that time.<br /> <br />For questions regarding this RFI, please contact Katie Hutton at katie.hutton@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Universal Detainee Identification and Information Tool<br />Innovation Day Announcement</p>
<p>Event: Innovation Day for Universal Detainee Identification and Information Tool</p>
<p>Sponsor: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Acquisitions (OAQ) &amp; Enforcement and <br />Removal Operations (ERO)</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, May 16, 2018</p>
<p>Time: Each vendor will be individually scheduled and will have 30 minutes to present to Government <br />representatives.</p>
<p>Where: The Potomac Center North (PCN) Building, 500 12th St SW, Washington, DC 20024</p>
<p>Background: The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Immigration and <br />Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) provides policy and oversight <br />for the administrative custody of one of the most highly transient and diverse populations of any <br />correctional or detention system in the world. ERO manages ICE detention operations efficiently and <br />effectively to provide for the safety, security, and care of aliens in ERO custody.<br />ICE oversees programs and conducts operations to identify and apprehend removable aliens, to detain <br />these individuals when necessary, and to remove illegal aliens from the United States. ERO <br />prioritizes the apprehension, arrest, and removal of convicted criminals, those who pose a threat <br />to national security, fugitives, recent border entrants, and aliens who thwart immigration <br />controls.<br />ERO manages all logistical aspects of the removal process, including domestic transportation, <br />detention, alternatives to detention programs, bond management, and supervised release. In <br />addition, ERO repatriates detainees ordered removed from the United States to more than 170 <br />countries around the world.<br />Comprising six headquarters divisions and 24 Field Offices, ERO consists of 7,621 employees and <br />manages a budget of approximately $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Description: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations <br />(ERO) welcome interested parties and organizations to prepare and deliver a 30-minute informative <br />presentation or demonstration to inform potential technological solutions for a new universal <br />detainee identification and information tool.<br />The initial focus shall be on a technological solution (examples include a non-permanent <br />tool/device, such as: identification card, wrist band with bar code, and radio-frequency <br />identification) to store and inform ERO and detention staff of critical information about a <br />detainee's health, safety, and impairments, including communication impairments. This will help to <br />ensure a detainee's health, safety, and security while in ICE detention by giving facility staff a <br />snapshot of the detainee's needs, alleviating the need for staff to check multiple data systems to <br />view the same information. The data captured may include: biographical information (e.g. <br />photograph, height, weight, notable markings and scars, and tattoos); medical information, <br />including alerts and vulnerabilities (e.g. disability and mental health); detention security level <br />(high/medium/low); and immigration court status. The tool/device will not be used to track <br />detainees or detainee location, but rather will be used to identify detainees and store key<br />information.</p>
<p>The tool/device will be considered ERO property and will accompany the detainee from intake <br />processing, through any detention environment, until removal or release from ICE custody. ICE ERO <br />is looking for solutions that have proven to be successful at other custodial agencies or law <br />enforcement agencies and wish to leverage best practices and lessons learned. Any proposed solution <br />needs to ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) is properly protected.<br />This Innovation Day will consist of one-on-one meetings with vendors at times to be specified upon <br />request for attendance. The purpose of the meeting is&nbsp;for the Government to&nbsp;gather more information and solicit feedback prior to release of a Request for Proposal.<br />Registration: If you would like to attend please email Tameka Long at the email below. Registration <br />by phone will NOT be accepted. Please send all requests to attend no later than 11:00 am on <br />Tuesday, May 8, 2018. Registration requests shall include full name(s) of all attendees, company <br />name, company unique entity identifier (DUNS) number, phone number, and e-mail address. All <br />attendees must be US citizens. Register via email to: tameka.long@ice.dhs.gov<br />Please use "Universal Detainee Identification and Information Tool Innovation Day Registration" in <br />the subject line of your email.</p>
<p>Reporting Instructions: Upon arrival each visitor will be required to pass through Security (left <br />entrance door when facing building), show photo identification, and obtain a visitor's pass. Please <br />arrive well in advance to allow for security processing. Visitors will require escorts while in the <br />building.</p>
<p>NOTE: Innovation Day is NOT a "bidders' conference". This announcement is NOT a promise to <br />contract, request for proposal, nor a commitment of any kind. The Government assumes no liability <br />for costs incurred by an offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for <br />examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not <br />considered an allowable charge to the Government. Information made available at Innovation Day, <br />either formally or informally, will not be made available via FEDBIZOPPS or GSA Advantage. There is <br />no expectation that any materials will be<br />formally distributed.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENT: The Selfridge Air National Guard Base has a need for repairs for the building lightning protection system. The scope of work for this construction project provides for, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1) Building 05 (Hanger Building): <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System (LPS): No LPS exists for this building. However, an existing antenna mounted on the roof in addition, the existing gas meter has conductors that terminate to their own ground rod. <br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: Since the roof has a span of over 40 feet and the slope is 1/4 or greater, this roof is defined as pitched (in lieu of flat or gently sloped). Therefore, an LPS system shall be based on a pitched roof as prescribed in NFPA 780, which includes, but are not limited to the following protection: air terminal shall be within 2 feet of each roof top ridge edge, air terminals along roof top ridge with 20 feet maximum spacing. Propose route down conductors from each top ridge edge down to bottom ridge edge and down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to a grounding rod for each down conductor such that ground rods are at diagonal ends of the building, and an air terminal shall be added to the roof exhaust fan. Since this roof has multiple/intermediate ridges, additional protection will be required (i.e. additional down conductors and ground rods). Since this building does not exceed 60 feet in height, an exterior ground ring is not required. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS as well as the antenna and gas meter grounding shall be bonded back to the building main ground bar inside the Main Distribution Panel(s) of this building.<br />2) Building 09 ASR (Airport Surveillance Radar): <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System (LPS): No LPS exists for this building. However, an existing antenna mounted on the roof and the existing gas meter has conductors that terminate to their own ground rod.<br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: Since the roof has a span of over 40 feet and the slope is 1/4 or greater, this roof is defined as pitched (in lieu of flat or gently sloped). Therefore, an LPS system shall be based on a pitched roof as prescribed in NFPA 780, which includes, but are not limited to the following protection: air terminal shall be within 2 feet of each roof top ridge edge, air terminals along roof top ridge with 20 feet maximum spacing. Propose route down conductors from each top ridge edge down to bottom ridge edge and down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to a grounding rod for each down conductor such that ground rods are at diagonal ends of the building, and an air terminal shall be added to the roof exhaust fan. Since this roof has multiple/intermediate ridges, additional protection will be required (i.e. additional down conductors and ground rods). Since this building does not exceed 60 feet in height, an exterior ground ring is not required. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS as well as the antenna and gas meter grounding shall be bonded back to the building main ground bar inside the Main Distribution Panel(s) of this building.<br />3) Building 12 Aircraft Shelters (Sunshades): <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System (LPS): LPS exists for this building, which consists of one air terminal at the center of each of the twelve pitched roofs. For each air terminal, the down conductor was routed along the roof and bonded to the top of the structural steel. A ground rod was located at each outside structural beam. A grounding electrode conductor was bonded to this ground rod and to the bottom of the structural beam. Approximately 6" of the ground rod are exposed and the remaining portion of ground rod has been embedded in the concrete pavement.<br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: Since the roof has a span of over 40 feet and the slope is 1/4 or greater, this roof is defined as pitched (in lieu of flat or gently sloped). Therefore, an LPS system shall be based on a pitched roof as prescribed in NFPA 780, which include but are not limited to the following protection. Air terminal shall be within 2 feet of each roof top ridge edge, air terminals along roof top ridge with 20 feet maximum spacing, route down conductors from each top ridge edge and bond to the outside edge of structural steel. The ground rods and at each outside structural beam and its bonding electrode conductor shall remain. A couple of the ground rods (over time) have moved up to where less of the rod is embedded in the concrete pavement. These rods need to be driven in the ground, via hammer, such that 6" of the ground rod is exposed. The existing air terminal at each sunshade was observed and is believed to be an ESE (Early Streamer Emission) type in lieu of a conventional type air terminal. This ESE type air terminal is not recognized by NFPA 780 and is not a UL 96 listed lightning protection component. Refer to UFC 3-675-01, Chapter 1-5, and Key Codes, Standards, and Chapter 3-1, paragraph 2, which states, "If lightning protection is required, provide a lightning protection system (LPS) in accordance with NFPA 780 criteria using components manufactured in accordance with UL 96. Provide a UL Lightning Protection Inspection Certificate for the facility certified to NFPA780, unless the design and inspection are otherwise identified to comply with a different standard for a specific facility." Therefore, since conventional in lieu of ESE air terminals are recognized by NFPA 780 and are UL 96 listed components, the existing air terminal shall be removed from each of the twelve sunshades and new conventional air terminals shall be added. Since this building does not exceed 60 feet in height, an exterior ground ring is not required. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout.</p>
<p><br />4) Building 15 Shop, Jet Engine Maintenance Repair: <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System (LPS): A very limited LPS exists for this building, which consists of an air terminal, one for each of the two flues/vents, with a conductor routed down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building and terminated to a ground rod. An existing antenna tower and the existing gas meter have conductors that terminate to their own ground rod.<br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: The LPS system shall be based on a flat roof as prescribed in NFPA 780, which include but are not limited to the following protection: air terminal shall be within 2 feet of each corner for the upper and lower roofs. Air terminals shall be along the perimeter of the upper and both lower roofs 20 feet apart, the down conductors and associated ground rod for the two existing flues/vents shall be removed, and down conductors shall be routed on the diagonal end of the building. Since this building does not exceed 60 feet in height, an exterior ground ring is not required. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This This LPS as well as the antenna and gas meter grounding shall be bonded back to the building main ground bar inside the Main Distribution Panel(s) of this building.<br />5) Building 24 Shop A/SE Storage Facility: <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System (LPS) A very limited LPS exists for this building which consists of an air terminal, one for each of the two flues/vents, with a conductor routed down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building and terminated to a ground rod.

For the roof on the east end, air terminals were observed at ends of each roof ridge and few intermediate air terminals were spaced between the roof's ridges. No down conductors were observed for the east roof. Since areas inside the building were not accessible and the ceiling had acoustical tile in lieu of being exposed, it seems reasonable to assume that these air terminals were bonded to building steel. The airfield tower roof has six air terminals, one at each building edge. The airfield tower roof is in the shape of a hexagon. The two vent pipes, roof hatch, guard rail at this roof, and the guard rail on the level just below are also bonded to this system.

This LPS shall be bonded to the building main ground bar inside the Main Switchboard Panel. <br />35) Building 1515 Department of Homeland Security Operational Integration Center:<br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System This building has an existing LPS that consists of the following: air terminals are installed within 2 feet of each corner of the two flat roofs, air terminals are evenly spaced along each flat roof perimeter, the majority of mechanical units have adequate air terminal protection, antennas on the roof were connected to the LPS, and down conductors protected by PVC conduits were routed down the back fa&ccedil;ade of the building to a ground rod. In addition, a tower at grade near the building and the existing gas meter had conductors terminating to a ground rod <br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: The cooling tower should have four air terminals in lieu of one such that each air terminal is no more than 2 feet from the edge of the equipment. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS shall be bonded to the building main ground bar inside the Main Switchboard Panel. <br />36) Building 1572 Warehouse Supply &amp; Equipment BSE Building: <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System: The LPS for this building consists of two air terminals mounted on the upper roof that route to a down conductor to a ground rod. These air terminals do not point up and the conductor between these air terminals is not supported properly <br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: The LPS system shall be based on this flat roof as prescribed in NFPA 780 which include but are not limited to the following protection: air terminal shall be within 2 feet of each upper and lower roof corner, an intermediate air terminal shall be proved for each side of the upper roof, for the upper roof only route one down conductor from roof top down to the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to a grounding rod, and the existing down conductor at the diagonal end of the building can be reused. Two of the existing air terminals can be reused but shall be re-mounted to point up and the conductor between these air terminals needs to be re-supported. Since this building does not exceed 60 feet in height, an exterior ground ring is not required. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS shall be bonded to the building main ground bar inside the Main Switchboard Panel.<br />37) Building 3570 ASR (Airport Surveillance Radar) Building: <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System This building has an existing LPS by Thompson Lightning Protection, Inc. that consists of the following: a ground bar that ties into the main ground bar inside the building located on the back of the building bonds to large metallic straps with isolation bars and two cable entry ports, an exterior transformer is bonded to ground, internal building ground bars penetrate the wall of the building and appear to bond the LPS; and a ground test well is located between the building and the radar tower and it seems reasonable to assume that there is an existing ground loop for this building. In addition, the radar tower and all associated metallic components and air terminals are bonded to the LPS. The supporting generator enclosure has a ground test well next to it that is bonded to its exterior building conduits and to the service entrance ground. Refer to Appendix A for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS should be tied together back to the building main ground bar which is assumed to be inside the Main Panel of this building. <br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: Air terminals are missing from the roof of the building due the rolling sphere method from the radar tower to this building. Air terminals shall be 2 feet from each corner. LPS shall be bonded to the building main ground bar inside the Main Switchboard Panel.<br />38) Building 3572 / 3573 ASR (Airport Surveillance Radar): <br />a. Existing Lightning Protection System This building has an existing LPS that consists of the following: air terminals are installed within 2 feet of each corner of the pitched roof, a mid-roof air terminal is located on the pitched roof, down conductors are routed down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to ground rods, two future cable ports at the back of the building are bonded and conductors are routed down the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to what is reasonable to assume a ground rod. In addition, for the tower next to the building the down conductors are routed down the tower and are coiled at both ends for future connection since the radar tower is not completely constructed. <br />b. LPS Deficiencies and Government Required Corrective Action: This building is not fully constructed. The radar tower will need air terminals at the top and shall bond to all metallic components (i.e. stairs). Once the electrical service is installed at tower, LPS and other grounding systems (i.e. generator) can be bonded together at the service entrance. Refer to Drawing for existing and proposed LPS layout. This LPS shall be bonded to the building main ground bar inside the Main Switchboard Panel.</p>

<CONTACT>Elliott Waxman, Phone 816-426-2068, Fax 757-664-3650, Email elliott.waxman@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Design Controls, Inc. for HVAC preventative maintenance, testing, inspection, and calibration at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL for the base period of performance of May 15, 2018 - May 14, 2019, plus up to four, one-year option periods.
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />NOAA/AOML has a requirement for HVAC maintenance services for their Johnson Controls Incorporated (JCI) Metasys HVAC System.  AOML utilizes JCI products including the main control software on the server, two primary supervisory controllers, DX-9100 controllers, and unitary controllers.  This request is for a service contract for preventative maintenance, inspections, testing, calibration, remote monitoring, and basic data management for AOML's HVAC controls system including a subscription to the JCI Metasys Services site to provide software upgrades.</p>
<p>Per a memo from JCI dated 01/17/2018, JCI only authorizes sales of its Metasys products or services through its own branch offices or through authorized distribution channels.  The geographic area partner for South Florida is Design Controls, Inc. (DCI).  Non-authorized channels cannot pass through any JCI warranty that is not sourced directly with JCI or an authorized distributor.  JCI shall not be held responsible or liable for any issues related to performance or malfunctions of existing systems created by unauthorized distributors or service providers.</p>
<p>Not contracting with an authorized JCI distribution, such as DCI would void the warranties of JCI equipment already in place at AOML.  This could cause substantial loss financially to the government if JCI products where to fail while not under warranty.  Without these services the AOML HVAC control system may not be properly maintained possibly resulting facility closures and/or mission delays.  Additionally, DCI both designed and built AOML's control systems upgrades, giving them unique knowledge of the new software, hardware, and its installation.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide this service may submit substantiating documentation in writing within seven (7) days of this notice.  Responses can be sent via e-mail to elliott.waxman@noaa.gov.  Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisition Division requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM).  No award can be made to a company not registered in SAM.  For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site:  www.sam.gov.  To register, all contractors must have a Dun and Bradstreet number.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO-20 is looking for sources of the following:

These are the only approved hand instruments to be processed with Sterile Processing for infection prevention and instrument processing that has been approved by National VA Dental.  

Resin basin instruments nor instruments manufactured from Pakistan are not approved for use in the VA due to the sterile processing standards.
Must be able to:
1.  Must meet approved VA Sterile Processing Standards.
2.  Periodontal Hygiene Hand Instruments:
 Hu-Friedy hygiene instruments are superior stainless-steel alloy that stays sharper longer for less frequent sharpening, more clinical efficiency, and greater productivity.  
 Using an enhanced finishing process, Hu-Friedy creates edges that are scientifically measured to be over 60% sharper than the next closest competitor.  
 Less force means easier, more comfortable scaling for the clinician and veteran.  
 The proprietary processing ensures that the superior edge retention and wear characteristics of EverEdge Technology will last the entire life of the instrument.  
 Since EverEdge is not a superficial coating, the instruments cane be re sharpened extending the life of the instrument.
 The unique diamond knurl pattern on the large diameter handle provides a confident and comfortable grasp for the hygienist.
 Handles are designed to be the optimal weight for reduced hand fatigue.
 Area-specific allows for deep scaling, root planning and periodontal debridement.
 Offset blade provides a perfect working angulation for the tooth surface.
 Offset blade angulation means only the lower cutting edge of each blade is used.
 Gracey curettes are ideal for tenacious calculus removal, gross scaling, and initial debridement.

BACKGROUND

The daily operation of the pharmacy chemotherapy drug compounding area must be in compliance with all safety regulations inclusive of USP 797 and USP 800. Safe operation is critical not only for patient care but protection of all staff in the vicinity. The compounding area is presently configured with connection of the non- hazardous and hazardous drug handling area. An evaluation of our current operational adherence to USP 797 and all other regulations including NYSDOH for such operations is prudent plus impact from USP800 when it goes into effect. Reconfiguration of the area to separate the non- hazardous drug compounding area from the hazardous drug compounding area is necessary. The reconfiguration is to take into account USP 800 policy which is not in effect yet but will be made mandatory by 2019. Tighter environmental control of the area during all seasons is also necessary.



SCOPE OF SERVICE REQUIRED 
620A4-18-212

The Architectural/ Engineering (A/E) Firm is to provide all necessary preliminary surveys, design & fabrication drawings, specifications, cost estimates, construction period services and site visits during design and construction phases necessary to complete a full functioning chemotherapy IV compounding area. 
Three conceptual designs will be presented while taking into consideration cost, timeliness and impact on the current ongoing day to day operations of the pharmacy. All conceptual designs will be reviewed and one conceptual design selected for full design effort for future construction. All conceptual designs will reconfigure layout of the compounding quad room area to separate hazardous drug formulation from non-hazardous drug formulation. All design concepts will correct environmental controls deemed insufficient and not meeting reasonable tolerances during all four seasons. All designs will take into account careful analysis and implementation of USP 797 and USP 800 in full. Conceptual designs will take into consideration all necessary HVAC ductwork modifications. Balancing of the other pharmacy locations outside of the compounding area will be taken into consideration.
The first conceptual design will involve modification of the existing AHU which is already located in mechanical room H-203 to increase airflow from the unit and stabilize environmental conditions. 
The second conceptual design will implement a separate independent air handling unit on the roof with dedicated service for the compounding area only. Rebalancing considerations of air flow for all other pharmacy areas served by the existing AHU currently utilized in H203. 
The third conceptual design will implement a separate independent air handling unit in storage closet H-300 with dedicated service for the compounding area only. Rebalancing considerations of air flow for all other pharmacy areas served by the existing AHU currently utilized in H203.

The C&A requirements do not apply and a security accreditation package is not required.

<DESC>Subject: <br />Louisville District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for a TEMF and Warehouse located in Barstow, CA.
<p>Solicitation Number: W912QR-18-PLA BarstowECSWarehouseandTEMF</p>
<p>Response Date (MM-DD-YYYY): 05-08-2018</p>
<p>Description: <br />The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:</p>
<p>This project is a design/bid/build project to construct a Modified Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility (TEMF) and General Purpose Warehouse in the vicinity of Barstow, CA for Equipment Concentration Site (ECS) 171. Supporting facilities include land clearing, utility connections, concrete aprons, gravel Privately-Owned Vehicle (POV) parking, two vehicle wash racks, equipment loading ramp and an overhead crane spanning work bays. Accessibility for the disabled will be provided. Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) and physical security measures will be incorporated into the design including maximum standoff distances from roads, parking areas and vehicle unloading areas. Sustainability/Energy measures will be provided. Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 40 years in accordance with DoD's Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 1-200-02) including energy efficiencies, building envelope and integrated building systems performance. Air Conditioning (Estimated 32<br />Tons). The TEMF facility is approximately 41,112 SF and the Warehouse is approximately 37,500 SF. Total of 78,612 SF.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
