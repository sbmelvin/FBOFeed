<DESC><p>The purpose of this effort is to create a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the F-15E which will enhance the reliability, maintainability and structural integrity of the aircraft through identifying "hot spots" of high stress levels in the structural members during operational loads. The FEM will consist of an updated model and finer mesh of the entire aircraft which will reduce time spent during structural investigations and increase accuracy. To utilize the FEM without the need of the proper system or personnel to perform a finite element simulation, the proposed contractor&nbsp;will create the F-15C/D and F-15E stressor tools. The stressor tools are databases of stresses of individual parts based on several flight conditions. The tool is both searchable and visually interactive by giving the user the ability to click on the model and pick a specific part.&nbsp; Destination: Robins AFB, GA 31098&nbsp;The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302, to Mercer Engineering Research Center (MERC) Warner Robins, GA 31088 CAGE (1WDH9) Justification: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &nbsp;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This requirement is being synopsized for subcontracting possibilities only. Interested sources should contact MERC for subcontracting possibilities. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04CA76C with Planners Collaborative, Inc. on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Theobjective is to extend the performance period for six additional months, consisting of afour month base period, and two one- month options. The current Contractor provides support for users and occupants of Ames Research Centerunder Business Operations and Technical Services (BOATS). The principal purpose of thiscontract is to provide a variety of professional and para-professional functions tovarious divisions at NASA-ARC. The Contractor provides support for scientific andtechnical information, including video, photo, publications, printing and libraryservices; human resource management and training; acquisitions; equal opportunity andaffirmative action; commercial technology; public affairs and education outreach; legaloffice; and related administrative programs. This extension will allow for a continuationof services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and avoidsignificant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04CA76C,for a period of six months, from July 1, 2009 through December 30, 2009, and increase thecontract value accordingly.  The current contractor, Planners Collaborative, Inc. isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension.	Awarding a six-month contract to another source, at thesame time as the recompetition of the follow-on is in process, would result insubstantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governmentsrequirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting thecontinuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST on June 25, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualificationswill be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete thisproposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to thisnotice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Starr L. Strong at Starr.L.Strong@nasa.gov. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

LRN PT challenges are distributed one to four times a year to as many as 200 LRN member laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The LRB and associated Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) Laboratory do not have the capacity or production capabilities to produce sufficient sample quantities to meet LRN PT Challenge requirements.&nbsp; Therefore, the purpose of this procurement is to obtain services from a qualified&nbsp;contractor to produce and distribute samples for a limited number of LRN Proficiency Testing challenges for biological threat agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total period of performance is 60 months from date of award.&nbsp; CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this RFP.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative medical therapeutic research proposals in two areas: Soldier Protection and Biodefense.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and revolutionary advances in science, devices, and/or systems.  Specifically excluded are evolutionary or incremental improvements to existing practices.

In recent years global surveillance networks have determined that the frequency and diversity with which new infectious microorganisms are emerging is increasing. While these increases are in part due to better reporting, there are multiple examples demonstrating this increase is promulgated by changes in natural systems, and potentially the activities of humans. Examples of factors implicated in the increase in new, emerging and re-emerging pathogens include:  increased animal-human interface; increased population densities and co-location of vulnerable species with pathogen reservoirs; climate change, particularly affecting migration and spread of vectors; and narrowing of genetic diversity among food animal stocks. The expansion of biomedical technologies on the global stage is also suspected to increase the risk of orthogonal and highly diverse microorganisms. One growing concern is the potential risk posed by the proliferation of genetic engineering technologies that can be easily redirected from beneficent to offensive purposes or for covert biological industrial sabotage of food animals. Together, these natural occurring and synthetic threat agents challenge current detection methods and could possibly defeat traditional medical countermeasures. No group is at greater risk of exposure to new international pathogens, to bio-sabotage of food supply lines, or of attack from biological threat agents, then the U. S. Military.  

The traditional medical response for responding to large scale infectious disease outbreaks is to 1) quarantine exposed personnel (hours to weeks); 2) identify and characterize the agent (usually within 0-90 days); 3) develop a vaccine or therapeutic (1-14 years); and 4) to stockpile, distribute, and administer treatment.  In cases where the pathogen is unknown or difficult to characterize, victims are likely to succumb before an effective therapy or vaccine can be developed, distributed and administered.   

DARPA/DSO is soliciting research proposals that seek to develop highly innovative approaches to counter any known, unknown, naturally occurring or engineered pathogen.  Proposed research will investigate novel technologies to prevent infection, extend survival until a curative response is available, provide transient immunity, or speed the onset of adaptive immunity.  Methods proposed should not require prior knowledge of the pathogen and should be broadly applicable to multiple unrelated infectious agents.

7-Day Biodefense is a two phase program focused on four Technical Areas: 1) Prevent Infection; 2) Sustain Survival; 3) Provide Transient Immunity; and 4) Create Persistent Immunity.  Each proposal must respond to only one of these technical areas and provide an aggressive research schedule with milestones that demonstrate a clear path to achieving the end of phase metric.  There will be a Live Fire Test in Areas Three (Provide Transient Immunity) and Four (Create Persistent Immunity) to demonstrate capability against a DARPA-designated unknown biological agent in an animal model (details provided in these technical area descriptions).

Novel approaches that obviate traditional and rate-limiting steps are of particular interest (e.g. pathogen isolation, culture, identification, antigen processing by the immune system, and onset of adaptive immunity).  This BAA is seeking pre-clinical validation only. Human clinical trials are specifically excluded. Also excluded from consideration is research that results in incremental and evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice (e.g. ventilator/mask technologies, use of traditional post-exposure antibiotics).

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM/OPS/SIO).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition ETL software product and support identified in Paragraph (3). Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (4) for limited source acquisition and approval, because of upcoming administration changes and to support the increase in congressional inquiries it is critical that the acquisition of the Informatica PowerCenter ETL tool be procured using the cited authority. The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of licenses for the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition and first year support that are listed in paragraph (3).  These licenses and support are required to design, develop, and implement a pilot for the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) by November 2008.  The EDW will be used to support questions and analysis that occur during an administration change and congressional inquiries.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Informatica PowerCenter Advanced Edition on the basis of a Brand name only acquisition. The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) is one of eight management reform initiatives reported to the Secretary that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) is currently executing.  The goal of EDW is to greatly diminish many of the challenges currently impacting the use of the Departments historical data, and to provide greater analytical ability to the end users.  This will first be accomplished by giving authorized users of the system desktop access to near real-time data.  This data will be pulled from various source systems and used to populate the EDW through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool.  The data warehouse will also have a Business Intelligence (BI) component integrated with it.  The BI component will present capability to run standard and ad hoc reports and will also provide tools to perform cross-cutting data analysis along with embedded user-friendly display ability.  By providing these capabilities, the EDW will turn raw data into shared knowledge thereby promoting information sharing throughout the Department.  This knowledge will in turn enhance the decision-making process, boost operating efficiency, and lower operating costs.  In essence EDW will increase the value of the Departments data set and allow the Department to have a forward and backward view of their data so that they may know what has happened, what is happening, and what is likely to happen. The ETL products and support listed below are required by IRM/OPS/SIO and are developed by Informatica.  These ETL products/support are available for purchase from Informatica and Informatica resellers.  
	1 PowerCenter Advanced Edition Repository	2 PowerCenter Advanced Edition Production CPU-Core	First Year Maintenance Support	1 PowerCenter Baseline Architecture Deployment Package.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the software/support identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  The Informatica ETL tool is essential for meeting the aggressive schedule of this critical Department initiative.  A/LM/AQM intends to compete IRMs requirements among Informatica resellers possessing a GSA FSS No. 70 contract.  The Enterprise Data Warehouse will be used to address queries and conduct analysis to support executive level decisions and to support congressional inquiries.  An ETL tool is the primary means of continuously populating data into a data warehouse.  The Informatica tool is required to perform concurrent data integration and metadata management, to ensure data integrity and to achieve an automated, reusable process implementation for the EDW project. The Informatica tool facilitates rapid processing of vast amounts of data, which is inherently needed to support the kinds of analysis required to assist executive decisions and congressional inquiries.  This speed is supported by targeting multiple data structures simultaneously without having to stage any data.  The Informatica tool will conduct self auditing analysis by capturing metrics around the data integration effort to ensure proper performance is achieved and alert administrators of potential data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the tool has an integrated ability to profile data.  This capability is useful to determine the datas quality and suitability for usage, which is vital to the success of a project dependent on multiple, disparate source systems.  In short the Informatica ETL tool will provide EDW the capability to pull data from disparate source systems in a compressed format with assured delivery of data, assured integrity of data, and checkpoint/restart capability, for recovery of transmissions in the event of a network drop.  These attributes come together to produce an ETL tool which is both flexible and possesses robust reliability.  Another benefit is that the Informatica ETL tool is already in use with some of the systems with which the EDW is integrating.  Therefore, there are areas within the Department that possess institutional knowledge about the Informatica ETL.  In addition, the Informatica ETL is the only ETL which can be used without having to add other tools for proper functionality.  Overall the Informatica ETL tool is the only tool on the market today meeting Department's requirements regarding cost and functionality.  The justification for the purchase of the Informatica ETL tool is further warranted by the fact that the Informatica tool performs all the abilities the EDW project requires today, and is expected to require in the future, in one tightly integrated package.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to purchase software proprietary to one manufacturer as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6 “To an item peculiar to one manufacturer.” As it stands, Phoenix Software International is the only known manufacturer of the abovelisted software.

The Social Security Administration currently owns a Site License for Falcon/DE software which is a mainframe-based data entry product acquired from Phoenix Software International.  This software provides the programming tools for designing and implementing panels, menus, and data tables, and for coding the several hundred applications that are currently being used. The software at the DSC must mirror the software that is currently installed at the NCC if SSA is going to accomplish its goal of establishing a co-processing environment as directed by the Department of Homeland Security

SSA also requires maintenance support on Government-owned Lifeworks Server and User Support Software Licenses.  These licenses are used for many non-annual wage reporting jobs.  This software enables SSA to key and process over 20 different workloads.  SSA has been using this software for more than 10 years but is still required for critical workloads.  These licenses are loaded on a DB1 in the Server Room in Wilkes-Barre PA.

Any vendor capable of providing software that can perform the essential requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capabilities by June 24, 2009. The evidence must include a discussion of how the software would satisfy the proposed requirements. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. All responses must be sent to Mike.DeAngelis@ssa.gov. by Wednesday, June 24, 2009 12:00pm EST.

<DESC>The Surface and Aerospace Surveillance Program managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is
soliciting applied research proposals to develop a low-band multi-function radio frequency system for
future airborne applications. The wide-band technology base is intended to support multiple mission
areas including: RADAR, Electronic Surveillance (ES), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Electronic
Countermeasures (EC), Electronic Warfare (EW), Electronic Attack (EA), Network Sensing and
Communications. Future MAST enhanced platforms, a mixture of manned and unmanned, would
support multiple current, and future, radio frequency (RF) requirements and missions via a single
flexible wide-band electronically scanned aperture. MAST platforms would operate effectively as a
stand alone platform or as a member of a networked sensing system.
Proposed efforts should focus on development of techniques, technology and systems that can be
used in a reconfigurable (software, firmware and hardware) airborne solution.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA), Governance and Vulnerable Populations (GVP) Office requires support to establish and manage a flexible mechanism that will provide technical assistance, training, material, and other resources as needed to a broad range of civil society organizations and stakeholders working to promote peace building and stable democratic governance in the Kingdom of Thailand.  

The overall development goal of this program is to foster constructive civil society engagement with the Royal Thai Government (RTG) as a means to building consensus for democratic political processes and mitigating extremism.
 
USAID/RDMA envisions a program obligated over three to five years which has three coordinated and mutually supportive components to reach the overall development goal. It includes components to (a) enhance capacities of key independent agencies to provide effective government oversight, (b) strengthen the capacity of Thai civil society organizations (CSO) and media to serve as checks and balances for political processes and public policy, and (c) support civil peace-building efforts and diminish the potential for radicalization and escalation of violent conflict in southern Thailand.  The program emphasizes capacity building of Thai CSOs and the use of Thai service providers when possible.   

USAID/RDMA envisions a combination of technical assistance, training and grants (for either US NGOs or Thai CSOs) to ensure rapid response to emerging opportunities and have ample capabilities to achieve objectives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Purpose:
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection, Procurement Directorate hereby issues the following Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) seeking level of interest from potential small business contractors to bid on this contract for Contractor Integrated Logistics Support (CILS). CBP is seeking information from potential contractors on their ability and level of interest to bid on this contract for Electronic and Precision Equipment and Repair and Maintenance as listed in the below description. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e).

Background:
The CILS contract will be responsible for sustaining DHS equipment in the best possible state of readiness for use in protecting the citizens, borders of the United States and ports of entry OCONUS/CONUS by providing Tier 2 and Tier 3 level of maintenance in the field.  This contract will support more than 30,000 technically complex and high-value inspection detection and surveillance equipment systems. This equipment is located in and between the land border crossings, airports, seaports, rail crossings, mail handling and express cargo consignments facilities in the United States and participating countries. The CILS contract is responsible for maintaining each Enforcement Technology (ET) prime equipment item at a high level of operational availability.  This consists of Large Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment, Small Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment, Radiation Detection Equipment, Cameras arrays and units, RADAR units, Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) and Handheld devices.  Additional types and technologies of sensor/detection equipment are expected in the future.  
The CILS contract will also staff and operate a 24 hour per day, 7 days per week Operations Center, including customer contact/support Service Desks.  The CILS contract will provide an automated system for total asset visibility of the operational condition of selected ET equipment in near real time.  The CILS contract will also be responsible for redeploying existing ET to foreign and domestic locations scheduled and assigned by Department of Homeland Security.  The deployed equipment at the various ports of entry is used to enforce compliance with all U.S. laws associated with persons and goods entering and leaving the U.S.  

Contractors who have an interest in this contract would need to design a CILS contract with as much flexibility as possible built into the program to allow for a constantly changing Department of Homeland Security environment.  In addition to regularly scheduled preventative maintenance, there is corrective maintenance required on all ET and relocations of equipment from one location to another to meet the Department of Homeland Security needs. Enhancements and upgrades are often required to ET systems, as well as technical refresh and refurbishment as the equipment matures.  

Objective:
To find a qualified 8(a) or other small business contractor who can provide CBP Officers with a full service delivery of enforcement technology integrated logistics maintenance support and timely re-deployments of Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment at our nation’s air, sea, and land borders and ports. 

Opportunity:
CBP is seeking information from potential contractors on their ability and level of interest to bid on this potential contract in 2010 for Electronic and Precision Equipment and Repair and Maintenance as listed in the description.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. 8(a) and other Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist the DHS in determining potential levels of competition available among small businesses. 

CBP, Office of Information Technology’s Enforcement Technology Program office (ETP) envisions the Contractor performs the following key tasks expected under this CILS program (this list is not all inclusive): 

1.	Maintain high Operational Availability (Ao) of ET Equipment

5.	Provide Preventive Maintenance (PM).
6.	Perform or ensure Corrective Maintenance is performed on all ET. 
7.	Perform Corrective Maintenance (CM) with low customer wait times.
8.	Administer the government’s calibration program on equipment to meet calibration due date or allowable variance dates for specific equipment types. 
9.	Provide infrastructure maintenance support to all assessorial peripheral equipment, assemblies and/or sub-assemblies inclusive of radio frequency (RF) equipment and networks, fiber optic equipment and networks, embedded Information Technology (IT), hardware and software, host platform maintenance, various electrical power sources and other critical supporting components.

11.	Provide cross-functional and multi-disciplined logistic and engineering technical expertise to remedy the ongoing corrosion control issues plaguing the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) family of systems.
12.	Repair damage of ET as a result of incidents and accidents.
13.	Manage and execute projects to refurbish, upgrade and/or enhance ET.  These projects are typically managed from either the Lorton, VA or Albuquerque NM depots but much of the work is performed in the field.

Schedule:
CBP anticipates that the CILS contract will be competitively bid in early 2010 with a award targeted for June 2010.  This schedule is notional and is subject to change. 

Responses Requested:
If no responses from qualified 8(a) vendors are received, then Customs and Border Protection reserves the right to conduct additional reviews in accordance with the 13th Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 125.18, 125.19, 126.605, and 126.607.  The order of precedence is as follows:

iv.	Description of state of the art reporting mechanisms (financial reporting and maintenance management) that would track program deliverables

The Government desires, if possible, that the majority of work on this contract be structured as a firm fixed price; however some cost reimbursement task orders with incentive are anticipated due to the nature of some of the CILS projects related, for example, for ET upgrade projects. ETP understands that some responses may be conceptual in nature, but welcomes ideas on how this contract could be structured or designed to benefit both the Government and Contractor.   The anticipated duration of the planned contract with option periods is anticipated to be from FY10 to FY15, one contract year with five option years. In order to determine which contracts to set-aside for various small business classifications, interested contractors are requested to submit capability statements addressing their ability to perform the PIC requirements for integrated maintenance and logistics support.  

Capability Statements should devote a majority of the statement write-up on their experience on other ILS maintenance contracts.  This should include a description of similar work performed in the past 5 years, the name and number of the contract, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, or commercial entity, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer. Contractors shall also provide their point(s) of contact name, address, telephone number, and email address; the company’s business size, including applicable NAICS code. Capability packages should address their sources’ capabilities with respect to the key features discussed above.      

Instructions and Response Guidelines:
RFI responses are due by 3:00 pm on Thursday, July 23, 2009 and shall be limited to a total of 15 pages that will include answers to all the questions above to include the capability statement.

Information provided will be used solely by CBP as market research and will not be released outside of the ETP CILS Contract Team.

<DESC>TO: All Prospective VendorsFROM: Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), National Business Center (NBC), U.S. Department of the Interior SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) - Mission Accomplishment and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) Integrator
NAICS CODE: 541519, Other Computer Related Services PRODUCT/SERVICE CODE: D302, ADP Systems Development Services
On behalf of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the AQD NBC is seeking feedback, on the attached Statement of Work (SOW), from system integrators and capable parties. The FDA protects the public by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of our nation's food supply, human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices and products that emit radiation, and cosmetics.  To do so, the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), the lead office for all Field activities for FDA, inspects both foreign and domestic facilities, performs investigations, collects and analyzes samples, and tracks and executes subsequent legal actions resulting from those activities in order to ensure compliance by regulated industry.The mission of ORA is to achieve effective and efficient compliance of regulated products through high quality, science-based work that results in maximizing consumer protection.  Besides its policy development and staff advisory role, ORA executes direct line authority over all Agency Import Operations.  This includes developing, issuing, approving, or clearing policies, proposals and instructions affecting field activities; and serving as the central point within the agency though which headquarters offices obtain field support services.To meet these responsibilities, FDA depends on automated systems.  These systems enhance our staff's ability to track products and the firms who manufacture and/or import them. They help FDA monitor and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and provide information about our activities and our obligations to the Executive branches of government, Congress, and the Public.The primary set of IT systems utilized by the ORA in fulfilling its mission is managed under the auspices of the Mission Accomplishment and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS) program.  The initial work under this Acquisition is continuation of work that was begun under separate contracts as part of MARCS.  Follow on work will address the longer term goals and objectives of the MARCS program.A future contract will obtain one contractor responsible for managing the risks of integrating the new services with the aging legacy systems. FDA would encourage this prime contractor to team with small businesses and other businesses to accomplish this overall goal.SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

<DESC><p>National Security Technologies (NSTec) is seeking sources who can provide Leak Test Equipment as described below.&nbsp; Suppliers&nbsp;will be required to submit detailed specifications along with a drawing or cut sheet of the equipment.&nbsp; NSTec will review your specifications and if you meet the minimum criteria&nbsp;noted,&nbsp;NSTec will contact you at a later date.</p>
<p>Procurement Requirements:<br />NSTec will use the leak test equipment to perform the preshipment leakage rate test for a certified Type B shipping package. The preshipment leakage rate test confirms the containment system is properly assembled for shipment of the package following the guidelines of Section 7.6, Preshipment Leakage Rate Test, of ANSI N14.5-1997.</p>
<p>&bull; The leak test equipment shall utilize the <strong>gas pressure rise test method</strong>, as described in Section A.5.2, Gas Pressure Rise, of ANSI N14.5, using air as the test gas.<br />o The leak test equipment shall produce a repeatable change in the leakage detector reading for an actual air leakage rate of 5&times;10-5 ref&bull;cc/s when testing a volume of 10 cc (which is representative of the calculated volume of the space between the inner and outer o-ring on a DT-23 Type B shipping packaging) plus the expected volume of the leak test equipment internals and the sample hose as required per Section 2.1, Definitions [Sensitivity of a leakage detector], and Section A.5.2.3, Test Sensitivity, of ANSI N14.5.<br />o The leak test equipment shall have the ability to perform a leakage check in the field. Leakage check feature will allow the operator to check instrument functionality, accuracy, and test sensitivity to verify instrument is functioning as required per Section B.14, Leakage Test Procedure Sensitivity.<br />o Each absolute pressure transducer shall be accurate within &plusmn; 0.25% of reading throughout the operating pressure range [of 1.31&times;10-5 to 1.31 atm. (0.01 to 1000 Torr)] as required per Section A.5.2.4, Test Method and Considerations, of ANSI N14.5.<br />o More than one absolute pressure transducer is recommended to meet the accuracy requirements of the volume test and the gas pressure rise test.<br />o Each temperature probe shall be accurate within &plusmn; 1.0&deg;C of reading throughout the operating range of 20 &plusmn; 25&deg;C, as required per Section A.5.2.4 of ANSI N14.5.<br />o Since the absolute pressure at the beginning of the gas pressure rise leak test has the largest impact upon the accuracy of this leak test, this initial pressure should be less than 1.32&times;10-4 atm [0.1 Torr] as recommended per Section A.5.2.4 of ANSI N14.5.</p>
<p><br />&bull; After the operator has entered the required testing parameters, the leak test equipment shall, as part of the internal software programming, automatically:<br />o Determine the actual system test volume.<br />o Evacuate the test volume.<br />o Isolate the test volume and allow the system to stabilize.<br />o Perform the rate of rise test.<br />o Print, display, and record the test results.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The leak test equipment shall include an electrical box / cabinet containing a built-in touch screen computer (preferably Microsoft Windows XP SP2 based). Additional computer-related specifications:<br />o Nominal 120 VAC power supply.<br />o Computer shall be mounted inside electrical box / cabinet on cart.<br />o The leak test equipment computer shall have at least two USB ports.<br />o The leak test equipment shall include a common printer (preferably Microsoft Windows XP SP2 based) connected to the computer through a USB port. The printer shall be capable of printing the results of the pressure rise test on standard 8 1/2" by 11" paper.<br />o Operator shall be able to store, recall, and edit testing input data on a local hard drive.<br />o Operator shall not be able to modify the testing results.<br />o It is recommended that users have the ability to store setup data on the leak tester computer to allow the next test to be a modification of the data just entered or to recall a listing from computer memory.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The leak test equipment shall be mounted on a rolling cart which must allow for equipment transportation off-site for periodic calibration.<br />o Cart should be constructed of aluminum or stainless steel and sized at 25 &plusmn; 5 inches in width and 44 &plusmn; 5 inches in length. The working height of the cart shall be sized for a standing operator. The cart should have capability to store small parts and procedures needed for this operation and the leak check hose and the power cord.<br />o Total time required by the leak test equipment to complete a preshipment leakage rate test shall be less than 20 minutes for the gas pressure rise test on a 10 cc part volume (plus the expected volume of the leak test equipment internals and the sample hose).<br />o The vendor shall provide a 6&plusmn;.5ft. sampling hose, flexible with a 90-degree to a &frac14;" (Male) VCR fitting. The leak check port is planned to be approximately 46-inches high with the VCR thread axis in the vertical position.<br />o The leak test equipment manifold shall be equipped with a filtered atmospheric vent.<br />o Since the majority of the test leak test volume is in the leak tester equipment manifold, the temperature probe shall be attached to the manifold. The leak test equipment manifold and temperature probe tip shall be insulated to within &plusmn; 2 in. of the tip.<br />o The vendor shall size the calibrated and certified volume (VC) for the leak tester's sensitivity. Each certified volume shall have a VCR fitting on the pneumatic manifold control valve that is welded to the volume. The volume shall be accurate within &plusmn; 5%.<br />o Completed assembly must be built to National Electrical Code (NEC), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) code.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L)Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM CAS) is seeking information from Industry on their ability to develop and qualify a precisionguidance kit/fuzing solution capable of a delivery accuracy of  30 meter Circular Error Probability (CEP) and compatible with current US inventory of 105mm artillery projectiles as described in the PGK-2 DRAFT Performance Specification.  
The USG is interested in the respondents feedback on the following areas: 
1)	Accuracy and performance predictions as a threshold capability for the US 105mm HE munitions including all variants of the M1/A1, M913, and M1130.  Identify any firing limitations such as minimum and maximum effective range and/ or gun elevation associated with predicted accuracy.
2)	Compatibility and technology maturation required for attaining similar accuracy and performance with 155mm projectiles as an objective capability. Identify each compatible projectile and the predicted accuracy and performance.
3)	 Integration of a 40mm round size form factor common Global Positioning System (GPS) based guidance and control electronics interface as per ongoing OPM CAS efforts.
4)	Development and integration of an anti-jam solution for GPS-based guidance and control in jammed environments, including system performance and a description of degradation in terms of jamming-to-GPS signal ratio (in dB),jammer power (in Watts), and distance to jamming source (in kilometers) as jamming levels (power and number of jammers) increase and potential corresponding incremental design solutions to counter multiple jamming sources at multiple jamming levels.   Identify rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimates for Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs and unit cost differentials for various levels of viable anti-jam solutions within a quantity range of 10,000 to 20,000 units per year.
5)	Ability to achieve size compatibility for short intrusion fuze well depth which, in conjunction with external booster (currently in development), is expected to be required for initiation of IMX-101 insensitive munitions fill in 105mm high explosives projectiles.
6)	ROM pricing associated with providing Government Purpose Use Rights for all aspects of the solution in support of emerging mandates to maintain competition throughout the life cycle of DoD systems.
The Government contemplates award of contract(s) in mid calendar year 2010. 
The proposed phased acquisition strategy is as follows: 
Phase 1:  Technology Demonstration /Shoot-Off is expected to be approximatelynine months and consists of design maturation and a competitive shoot-off leading to a downselect to the best approach based on demonstrated accuracy,reliability and other performance and maturity aspects.  
Phase 2:  Completion of Engineering Manufacturing and Development (E&MD) isexpected to be approximately eighteen (18) to thirty (30) months to complete full qualification manufacturing readiness for PGK-2.  Feedback is requested on the viability and advantages/disadvantages foreseen regarding a requirementto support two GPS component suppliers through Critical Design Review .  (Note:  This approach is being considered to both reduce risk and promote competition for an expected cost driver component)
Phase 3:  Following a Milestone C decision, there is a planned Initial Production and Deployment (IP&D) that contains three production options (1 year per option). 

Its anticipated the Production phase pricing will include Not To Exceed (NTE)costs for three production options which include a quantity range of 10,000 to20,000 per year.   
Interested respondents may obtain the following upon request and coordinationwith POC listed below. (Note:  At a minimum, a Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed and on file, a Form DD2345, and Form 1350 willbe required):

<DESC><p>It is the Government's intention to negotiate on a sole source basis with HydroGeoLogic, Inc. for the acquisition of services to continue mathematical modeling and associated tasks begun under sole source Contract W912P4-06-C-0005 Delivery Order 0006, expiring 31 July 2009 prior to completion of the work. The Niagara Falls Storage Site is a 191-acre FUSRAP site that includes an interim waste containment structure (IWCS), which houses highly radioactive residues (i.e., over 2,000 Curies of radium-226 - the highest FUSRAP inventory), radiologically contaminated soils, and assorted wastes. The balance of the site also has interdependent soil and groundwater contamination that will require sophisticated modeling tools to assess potential remedial strategies for both the IWCS and balance of site. To meet the essential CERCLA requirements for the NFSS, it is essential to model, as a function of time, the potential for contaminant transport on and off site; this ability allows the USACE to clarify existing conditions and test alternative remedial concepts for the Feasibility Study (FS). A clear presentation of results is required for later risk communication to the public. This fate and transport work supports both the Remedial Investigation (RI) Addendum phase and Feasibility Study under CERCLA.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all submittals received by the due date of June 29, 2009 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.   It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria<BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical criteria and the products meet or exceed the clinical performance expectations, price will become the deciding factor in the selection.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. The major Medical Treatment Facilities in the Southwest Region, TRBO Region 9/10 area include the Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center Travis Air Force Base, Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, Robert E. Bush Hospital Twenty-Nine Palms, Weed Army Community Hospital Fort Irwin, Naval Hospital Lemoore, 9th Medical Group Beale Air Force Base, 30th Medical Group Vandenberg Air Force Base,  the 61st Medical Squadron Los Angeles Air Force Base, and  the 95th Medical Group Edwards Air Force Base. The major Medical Treatment Facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region, TRBO Region 2 area include the Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg; 43rd Medical Group, Pope Air Force Base; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune.<BR> The major Medical Treatment Facilities in the Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5 area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox, Kentucky, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City, Michigan.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is Oct 2009. Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

Post standardization costs will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the region. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post Standardization Cost at the current suppliers non-discounted price. Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price (Post Standardization Cost) will be the deciding factor. <BR><BR>Source Selection Procedures  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRBs) for the Pacific, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Heartland Regions are the governing bodies of the standardization process and program. These boards include clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Pacific, Southwest, Mid- Atlantic and Heartland Regions. The boards are chaired by the Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs). They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Pacific Region TPRB is Co-Chaired by a physician from Naval Hospital Yokosuka and an Air Force Nurse Corps officer assigned to the Hawaii Multi-Service Marketing Management Office (MSMMO). The DSLs are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>Technical  Criteria Evaluations<BR>The vendors responses to the technical criteria will be reviewed for acceptability.  Acceptability is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the vendor can meet the standard of each technical criterion; 2.) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community that are applicable to such products or services; and 3) the information provided by the vendor is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  Failure to provide any requested information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Vendors must achieve an acceptable rating on their responses to the technical criteria for continued consideration in this initiative.  Vendors who do not achieve an acceptable rating will be disqualified.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Technical Criteria<BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete product line of Intravenous Solutions.

Each criterion is of equal weight.  Products will be scored on a pass/fail basis.  Products must meet or exceed the performance expectation contained in each outlined clinical performance criterion to receive a score of pass.  Products that receive a score of pass from 80% of the participating clinicians will be considered clinically preferred products and will continue to the pricing analysis phase of this standardization initiative.  Vendors whose products fail to receive a score of pass from 80% of the participating clinicians will be disqualified from further consideration.  In the event that the identical product is offered by multiple vendors, the regions reserve the right to limit the evaluation to one sample of the duplicative products.<BR>Clinical evaluations will be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The clinical performance criteria for this initiative are:<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR> <BR>1.	Type of fluid solution is easily identified from the outer packaging and fluid solution container. <BR>2.	The fluid container is optically clear, making it easy to determine the condition of the fluid. (Addresses Patient Safety  any sediment, particle threads, opaque quality of the fluid, or foreign materials can be acutely and potentially deadly to a patient  the solution is considered contaminated)  <BR>3.	Container labeling is easy to read and includes volume gradient and expiration date. <BR>4.	The fluid container access port can be easily spiked with the tubing remaining secure with no leaking.  <BR>5.   The fluid container access port is easily spiked by the connector systems/devices, by <BR>    Pharmacy clinicians, for drug ad-mixtures or medication vial therapies. <BR>

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) and Protected SATCOM Group intends to modify the existing CASIES contract, FA8808-06-C-0002, to increase the level of effort by approximately 18,000 hours for Option Year 2, by 29,000 hours for Option Year 3 and by 37,000 hours for Option Year 4 for the MILSATCOM Protected Group (AEHF program). In addition, 28,000 hours will be added for Option Year 3 and 4 to support MILSATCOM Systems Wing Engineering, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2).
<p>The modification for increased CASIES support will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Linquest Corporation, 5140 Goldleaf Circle, Los Angeles CA, 90056-1299.</p>
<p>This action modifies an existing contract to increase the authorized level of support to the Protected SATCOM Group (MCPG) to accommodate an extension of activities due to over two years of launch slip impacts in the AEHF program. The original contract envisioned a ramp-down of required System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) on AEHF following first launch, scheduled at the time for April 2008. Since then, delays on the AEHF development contract have pushed launch out by over two years. As a result, the planned ramp-down of SE&amp;I requirements is premature, so it is necessary to increase the CASIES effort to support continuing AEHF development and integration. This modification does not add new requirements to, nor extend the period of performance of, the CASIES contract.</p>
<p>The MILSATCOM Systems Wing issued a Sources Sought Synopsis on 15 April 2005 to solicit input from industry and examined the acquisition history of this type of support to AEHF program. The program office maintains cognizance over the protected SATCOM market and has seen no other companies emerge with the capability to meet these requirements without incurring a significant duplication of costs and unacceptable schedule impact to the program.</p>
<p>The information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. This notice is for information purposes only and the Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices.</p>

To the best of our knowledge, Duke University Medical Center is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to issue a sole source contract to Cornell University, Office of Sponsored Programs, 373 Pine Tree Road 
 Ithaca, New York 14850-2820 . The period of performance will be 6 months. Cornell University will 1) Expand the input and output capabilities of the current retail Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) cross contamination Risk Assessment model with data and information that are not currently in place and limited in nature such as sub-typing information, laboratory testing data etc. 2)  Develop a report describing the data and information necessary to inform and update the current model now, and in the future, with data obtained from retail studies previously conducted by the contractor in New York State and those from proposed studies in additional states. 3) Provide a description of how new data will improve the value of the model’s predictions and the implications of such predictions on policies designed to address the public health concerns of Lm. 4)  Design and develop sampling plans to help in the mitigation of Lm risks in a retail environment. 
Cornell University is the only contractor that can do this work as it is the primary author and innovator of studies that led to new insights regarding Lm contamination in retail facilities in the State of New York.
Cornell University also has generated unique data sets on L. monocytogenes contamination at retail, which could be shared with FSIS. Data from these studies will help populate, improve, and inform the current model with specific inputs and outputs that will ultimately help design and develop adequate policy options to address the problem.
 The determination by the government to issue a sole source contract is made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is solely at the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a Request For Proposal (RFP). In accordance with FAR 5.207(15):  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  Responses are due by 3:00 p.m. on June 30, 2009. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

Sheps Center for Health Services Research, CB # 7590, 725 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Chapel Hill, NC 27599.  The purpose of this procurement is to conduct an evaluation of the Patient Assistance Programs (PAP) pilot project.  The evaluation will provide guidance to ORHP regarding potential next steps in the effort to support the efforts of rural clinics to provide affordable pharmaceuticals for their low income patients.  The Medication Access and Review Program (MARP) program has been quite successful in North Carolina, a state with the infrastructure necessary to support both the implementation and long term sustainability of such a system.  However, it is necessary to determine if a program such as MARP can work in states without a comparable infrastructure and whether the pilot has generated enough lessons learned to create opportunity for other rural clinics through informed and sustainable system dissemination. The period of performance for this project is for twelve (12) months.  NAICS Code: 611310

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is on file, which states and supports that The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Rural Health Research and Policy Analysis Center, Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research is the vendor because it is uniquely qualified to carry out these activities.  NC-SHEP has extensive experience working on rural health issues with a particular concentration on rural pharmacy issues.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole-source Lease Contract to the Massachusetts Port Authority, whose address is One Harborside Drive, Suite 200S, East Boston, MA 02128-2909.  TSA has occupied 1,137 square feet of office space known as the Fish Pier since March 17, 2006. The space is utilized as administrative space by the Transportation Security Administration’s Rail Inspectors Group.  Because the function of this group is not directly related to the screening of passengers at the airport, this space is most conveniently located off airport property. 

The Transportation Security Administration intends award this lease under the authority of FAR 6.302. This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition. 

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. All interested firms must respond by Monday, June 29, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. local Washington D.C. time to Antoinette Glover, REF: HSTS01-09-L-RIN026, Antoinette.Glover@dhs.gov. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Transportation Security Administration will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

The Department of State PKI program uses Precise Biometrics' 200MC hardware, which includes both smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers. Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust Software Suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP), middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 200MC readers to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one reasonable source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(4)(c), Application for brand descriptions, is cited as the statutory authority. The Department has multiple technical requirements for its deployment of Smart Card Readers. Only Precise biometric readers meet all Department requirements.  The following are identified as requirements that cannot be met by another vendor to date: All processing of the biometric is handled within the reader device and the smart card in what is termed Match on Card (MOC) technology. No images or biometric information can pass between the reader and a PC, occur on the PC, or are validated across the network. This is a critical component to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Without this protection, an additional layer of security would have to be architected into the device to ensure the biometric minutia was not exposed. 2. Because the Precise model readers incorporate biometric readers, coupled with smart card readers, the Department meets the two-factor authentication requirement. This is a major security component that can only be ensure through the use of both biometrics and possession of the smart card token which Precise Biometrics provides.  3. The processes to support MOC technology are proprietary. Hence, future upgrades of firmware and software would not be able to be duplicated by another vendor.<BR><BR>. 4. Management of multiple reader platforms will create significant and costly configuration management issues for the Department. Given the requirements in managing one manufacturer's platform across the enterprise, coupled with deploying the required software, to include updates and patches, multiple platforms would create serious logistics problems for the Department. It would require the multiple software drivers to be pushed to all Department PCs, which would potentially create software incompatibilities on those PCs. Because the devices would be incompatible, posts would be required to keep more spare readers on hand than with one device, simply because of that incompatibility which would be more costly for the Government. This would ultimately cost the Department more in maintenance than having to only maintain one platform. 5. The Precise model readers are the only devices that are compatible with SafeNet BSec Middleware, which is currently deployed within the department, and is a critical component to meeting security requirements. Moving away from this standard would create multiple incompatible configurations on computer systems that would be driven by which reader was available for installation. This has the potential to drive cost, security and logistics issues. The cost factor for the Government would be minimal in using Precise Biometrics readers that is compatible with the systems already in place for all of Department of Sate and the posts worldwide. 6. The Precise model readers perform both biometric enrollment and verification of users. This flexibility ensures that only one reader need be deployed on users' desks for both system requirements. 7. Various readers respond differently to the placement of fingers when the biometric is read. Use of multiple readers within the Department would affect the logon process for some readers, as finger placement can make it very difficult for some users to logon. As the readers will be required to logon to OpenNet, this will prove to be frustrating should users not be able to easily and consistently logon with the same level of confidence. 8. The Precise Biometric reader is the only reader currently on the GSA HSPD-12 approved products list, which is both HSPD-12 compliant, and supports our legacy installation.<BR><BR>52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Reporting Requirements(Mar 2009)<BR><BR>52.203-15 Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)<BR><BR>52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items (Apr 2009)  (Alternate II  Mar 2009)<BR><BR>The Contractor shall meet the following delivery schedule:

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the supplies listed below.  The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     
  
The solicitation number is 09-222-SOL-00074.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32, May 14, 2009.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516– Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Size Standard 500 Employees.  	

The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for the following:  

Purchase of a new Differential Scanning Calorimeter System with pressure perturbation calorimeter accessory including desktop computer with monitor and keyboard with factory installed control data analysis software in accordance with the following specifications: 
Description: In general, differential scanning calorimetry is a method used to determine the thermodynamic constants governing diverse types of physical and chemical processes.  Conventional DSC instruments are used to characterize physical/chemical transformations occurring in medium-to-larger sample quantities (20 - 1,000 mg).  A specialized type of DSC instrument is required for the analysis of very small quantities (&#8805;0.02 mg)  of potentially dangerous biomacromolecules.  It is unreasonably dangerous, unwise, and cost prohibitive to produce, store, or utilize the large quantities of dangerous protein toxins required for analysis by conventional DSC.  Bioterrorism and food safety studies on the stabilities of protein toxins (ricin, abrin, and shiga-like toxins) are performed by using very small sample sizes, typically 0.01 - 0.05 mg.  For overwhelming safety and cost reasons, a DSC system capable of analyzing small amounts of very toxic proteins is required.
Performance Specifications:  The complete DSC system must satisfy the following critical elements: 
A.	Low short term Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).  0.5 microcalorie/°C (RMS average) when scanning from 5°C - 110°C at 90°C/hr scan rate using a 30 second time filter.  Low SNR is required for accurate integration of excess heat capacities to determine &#916;Hm or discern minor differences in &#916;Cp expected when using microgram quantities of protein samples.
B.	Appropriate scanning temperature range. -5°C to 130°C.  Measurements made far above normal cooking temperatures (200°C, or 400°F) are less relevant for most protein chemistry experiments and extended temperature ranges typical for conventional DSC are inappropriate for our planned studies.  Higher precision measurements of Tm should be expected with an instrument whose operating temperature range is focused in that expected for protein samples.
C.	Baseline reproducibility.  Standard deviation for replicate scans should be 1.5 microcalorie/°C within the temperature range typical for protein denaturation (5°C - 95°C) at 90°C/hr scan rate using a 30 second filter.
D.	Internal Peltier device.  External water baths cannot provide precise thermal control to the degree achieved by Peltier thermal control circuits.
E.	Maximum sensitivity. Thermodynamic measurements have been made using microcalorimetry DSC systems using as little as 0.0125 mg lysozyme.  Conventional DSC systems typically require 20 mg protein per analysis, a potentially lethal quantity for some of the toxins studied by our laboratory.
F.	Automated sample degassing/thermostatting. The DSC system must be equipped to perform reliable degassing and thermal equilibration of sample and reference materials prior to analysis.
G.	Minimal sample and reference chamber volumes.  The sample and reference chambers should contain &#8804;0.5 mL, minimizing the need for large sample volumes.
H.	Adjustable scan rates.  0°C/hr to 90°C/hr (heating mode); 0°C/hr to minus 60°C/hr (cooling mode).  Variable scan rates are required to study the mechanisms of protein toxin denaturation and renaturation.
I.	Biochemically inert sample and reference chamber materials. The sample and reference chambers must be constructed from temperature-resistant, biochemically inert materials.
J.	Adiabatic sample and reference chambers. The sample and reference chambers must be thermally isolated from the environment completely to allow small differences in excess heat capacity between the chambers to be reproducible and significant.
K.	Pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC). The sample and reference chambers must be equipped for reliable PPC experiments at &#8805;5 atm.
L.	Integrated software/computer control.  A computer system (desktop or notebook computer with monitor, keyboard, mouse, no printer) is required for operation of the instrument and data analysis.  The computer system must provide adequate performance (processor speed, internal memory, card slots, disk space, etc.) required to operate the instrument control software.  The computer system must provide compatibility with the FDA/NCTR intranet.  The software interface must be Section 508-compliant and satisfy DHHS/FDA/NCTR VPAT requirements. Software and computer system must be compatible with MS Windows XP OS. Data generated by the DSC software system must be compatible with or exportable to MS Excel 2003 and MS PowerPoint 2003.  As appropriate experiments are performed related to the thermodynamic stability of protein samples, the software system must perform data analysis to measure heat capacity (Cp), change in heat capacity with temperature (&#916;Cp ), derive transition temperatures (Tm), van’t Hoff enthalpy (&#916;HvH ), calorimeter enthalpy (&#916;Hcal ), entropy (&#916;S), Gibbes free energy (&#916;G ), and equilibrium constant (Keq).  Software must also be capable of instrument control, data collection, and data analysis for PPC experiments to derive coefficients of thermal expansion (&#945;) and volumetric changes in proteins associated with ligand binding.
M.	Documentation. Users manuals for the software system and all system components must be provided.  Field service manuals must be provided for all components. 
N.	Warranty. Supplier must provide a warranty period of 12 months from the date of installation.
O.	Field service and technical support.  The supplier must offer field service for installation and instrument repair beyond the scope of the NCTR instrument repair contractor (Bionetics). The supplier must offer technical support for training and consultation.  
P.	Delivery/installation date.  All components will be delivered within 60 days of purchase.  System installation will be completed within 30 days of delivery.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(HL)-2009-200/GMV and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334510, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 and is a small business set-aside.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to procure the equipment specified below from Nova Medical, Inc. 150 West Street, Suite 201, Wilmington, MA 01187.

1.	Part Number NMSC070A-8-1.5S
Custom Eight Channel Flexible SENSE Array in 8x1 geometry for ANIMAL IMAGING ONLY.  Coil coverage to be 40cm (RL) x 24cm (SI).  Seven (7) openings to be present in coil with size >3.6cm.  Coil foam thickness <=1.5 cm.  Coil provided with preamplifiers/cabling for interface to Siemens 1.5T Scanner.

2.	Part Number NMSC070B-8-1.5S	
Custom Eight Channel Flexible SENSE array in 8x1 geometry.  Coil coverage to be 40cm (RL) x 24cm (SI). Coil provided with preamplifiers/cabling for interface to Siemens 1.5T Scanner.  (Investigational Device and Federal Law Limits their use to investigational purposes).

3.	Part Number NMSC070C-8-1.5S
Custom Eight Channel SENSE array in 8x1 geometry final specifications TBD.  Coil provided with preamplifiers/cabling for interface to Siemens 1.5T Scanner.  (Investigational Device and Federal Law Limits their use to investigational purposes).


The Translational Medicine Branch (TMB) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is involved in ongoing clinical and laboratory studies whose aim is to develop new understanding and treatments for cardiovascular disease. Within each of these sections a number of basic mechanistic studies and/or translational or clinical protocols are currently underway. The clinical focus includes the use of stem cells in cardiovascular diseases, novel approaches to treat patients with intractable coronary ischemia, application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology for patients with peripheral vascular disease and new therapeutic approaches for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On the basic research side, efforts are underway to better understand cell cycle regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, the role of reactive oxygen species in signal transduction pathways, cholesterol transport in macrophages and large scale genomic applications in cardiovascular disease. The TMB also provides state of the art diagnostic technologies and expertise, including stress testing (EKG, echo, radionuclide ventriculography), 2-D and 3-D echocardiography, nuclear imaging (left ventricular function studies, myocardial perfusion, myocardial metabolism), electrophysiology testing, pacemaker management, and cardiac catheterization.

The Cardiovascular Intervention Program within the Translational Branch is developing image guided transcatheter cardiovascular interventional procedures guided by MRI. These
procedures will be conducted during real-time imaging of the patient inside a clinical MRI
scanner. In some cases, the interventional cardiologist must place devices such as needles and
catheters directly through the chest to access the heart. Surface receiver coils placed on the
patient’s chest to image the heart present an obstacle to these devices. The current vendor supplied body array does have holes which can accommodate devices, but it is not optimized
for rapid real-time imaging. Consequently, compromises are made in either image quality or
imaging speed, which are not acceptable for clinical procedures. Other coils obtained do not have 
access holes. A custom receiver coil is needed which is designed to allow direct cardiac access
through holes in the coil and which is also optimized for real-time cardiac imaging.

The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions:  1) FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical Evaluation and Price.  3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.  This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  The offeror must include in their quotation, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.  Note:  In order to receive an award from the NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.

Solicitation number N00167-09-T-0113 applies and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a firm fixed price contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to National Instruments Corporation (NIC). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This acquisition is for test and measurement!  equipment to replace the Intermediate Scale Measurement System (ISMS) model acquisition system at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD), Bayview, ID. This equipment must integrate seamlessly with existing custom acquisition software and with over 560 channels of existing NIC hardware currently utilized at ARD.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<BR>employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<BR>professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer<BR>System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<BR>$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<BR>would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<BR>rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<BR>job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<BR>for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<BR>that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<BR>conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an<BR>individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<BR>of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<BR>this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<BR>that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<BR>described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<BR>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<BR>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<BR>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT:<BR>Eric C.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Legal effect of quotations: As prescribed in FAR 13.004(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier’s quotation does not establish a contract.

Facsimile quotes are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-334-5242.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-384-7230, and email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Delivery Date
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Delivery Date 	

The Government desires delivery to be made within 35 days ARO.
		   	
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule after date of contract, it may without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time of delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:

Offerors may propose early delivery schedule for orders based on plant capacity which will be considered during the proposal evaluation. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the delivery schedule above will apply.  The offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer.  The government will evaluate on offer that proposes a Contractor’s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding one work day for award or notice transmitted electronically.  (The term “work day” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)


Proposed Delivery Schedule:			         		   WITHIN DAYS 
							       	 AFTER DATE OF 
ITEM NO.		    QUANTITY 			    CONTRACT	             

0001				4			               (_______________)


Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Onbudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through frank and open discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, MartinLuther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, andChristmas Day.  A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays anotherday off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)(See 29 CFR 4.174)THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination doesnot apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Becausemost Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a ratenot less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 perweek) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupationswithin those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may notlist a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the surveydata indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  Forexample, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs dutieswithin the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmeroccupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with theconformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wagedetermination.Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computerindustry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computerprofessional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employeeswho satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, includingconsulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functionalspecifications;    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing ormodification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on andrelated to user or system design specifications;    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computerprograms related to machine operating systems; or    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of whichrequires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If youwork at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differentialand receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of yourregularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sundaypremium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is consideredovertime work).HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employeesemployed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with orin close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  Thisincludes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitiveordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powderand photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operationson sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operationsinvolving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position thatrepresents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity toordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materialswhich involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of theemployee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and thelike; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, andincendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentialsare only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency forordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.OCCUPATION NOTES:Laundry, Drycleaning, Pressing and Related Occupations: The rates for theoccupations in this category applies to Napa and Solano counties only.  See WageDetermination 1981-1168 for the wage rates and fringe benefits for Sonoma county.** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state orlocal law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (bylaundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by anemployee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wagedetermination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with thefollowing standards as compliance:The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with anadequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actualcost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is madethe responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject tothis wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargainingagreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contraryaffirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaningand maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, inthose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and donot require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commerciallaundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the termsof the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. Alinks to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site athttp://wdol.gov/.REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form1444 (SF 1444)}Conformance Process:The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which isnot listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work tobe performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wagedetermination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonablerelationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlistedclassifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Suchconformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished thefringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated bythe contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shallbe retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to beconformed.The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformedoccupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in orderproposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for eachproposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wagerate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of theauthorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorizedrepresentative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to thecontracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employeesperforms any contract work.3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a reportof the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinentinformation including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wageand Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, ordisapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, ornotifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to processthe request.5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.6) The contractor informs the affected employees.Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory ofOccupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insurethat duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in thewage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks thatdetermine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivideclassifications listed in the wage determination. In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6) the following information is provided to justify the brand name procurement. The Eckel C124 Audio Booth is constructed using the patented cam-locking system which allows the booth to be easily installed or removed without the use of "adhesives".  The booth can be easily reconfigured to meet the changing needs of the VA San Francisco Medical Center.  The Eckel Audio Booth is ADA compliant with a low profile floor, which eliminates the need to cut the concrete floor.

<DESC>Question #1 Section 3 Cabinetry/Cabinet: Do you have a layout drawing or design on the cabinet. It appears to be a “single drawer weapons locker”, but discusses adjustable shelves, vertical dividers and doors.  

In regards to the Section 3, there is an attached drawing. The items identified (shelving, doors, etc.) is a generic description scope of work, this will not apply to these units.  However, dividers will be part of the drawer system to provide the handler options.

Question #2 Will the chassis be delivered?

It is NOW requested that the contractor provide a cost estimate to pick up these units at our warehouse in Sterling, Virginia via trucking company and drop ship via trucking company two units at Glynco Ga., one unit at Dallas, Texas, and one unit at Sterling Virginia. Complete address will be provided upon award of the contract. This is a change to the original statement of work.

Question #3  Can you clarify the layout?

It is a basic layout as far as a police package goes.  It states in the scope of work plans need to be submitted for all electrical, cabinetry, and console before work will begin.  This means that the contractor will have to provide proof of their knowledge of law enforcement vehicles and be able to work closely with ATF before any work is to begin.

Amendment #2

Question #1 

Section 3 Cabinetry/Cabinet: Do you have a layout drawing or design on the cabinet. It appears to be a “single drawer weapons locker”, but discusses adjustable shelves, vertical dividers and doors.  

In regards to the Section 3, there is an attached drawing. The items identified (shelving, doors, etc.) is a generic description scope of work, this will not apply to these units.  However, dividers will be part of the drawer system to provide the handler options.

Question #2

It is NOW requested that the contractor provide a cost estimate to pick up these units at our warehouse in Sterling, Virginia via trucking company and drop ship via trucking company two units at Glynco Ga., one unit at Dallas, Texas, and one unit at Sterling Virginia. Complete address will be provided upon award of the contract. This is a change to the original statement of work.

Question #3  

Can you clarify the layout?

It is a basic layout as far as a police package goes.  It states in the scope of work plans need to be submitted for all electrical, cabinetry, and console before work will begin.  This means that the contractor will have to provide proof of their knowledge of law enforcement vehicles and be able to work closely with ATF before any work is to begin. 

Amendment #3

Question #4

Federal Signal and Code 3 make comparable products that would work seamlessly into your existing fleet, and we would be glad to build a pilot vehicle for your evaluation, or send samples to you for you too look at. I think if they were to be considered you would agree that these 2 companies make superior LED products. That was the only question on the lights.

In regards to the warning system of the four vehicles, the installation of the Federal Signal, Soundoff Signal, 911 EP or the Code 3 system is acceptable. It will require the same scope of work regarding the electrical system and to ensure that the manufactures warranty is voided. In reference to a pilot vehicle, this would enable our law enforcement staff to evaluate the unit and identify any issues that they may have, providing there is no cost to the Bureau.  In the event there may be a cost associated with option, the Bureau would decline such an offer. 

Question #5

On the K9 unit would you consider an aluminum unit made by American aluminum products, we have found out that they are just as rugged but a lot lighter which could help with fuel mileage in the long run, and it dissipates heat a lot better than the steel one. And there will be no rust issues in the future.

In regards to the K9 cage, it has been determined that the use of the steel model is the only acceptable unit due to safety and standardization reasons.  

Question #6

On the cabinet, have you looked at a manufacture for your design? What are you currently using?

In regards to the truck vault, the unit from Odyssey is the preferred model to be used, providing standardization of our fleet

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following two questions have been received from potential bidders.<br />Please respond as soon as possible to me so that I can respond in the<br />form of an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp; In reviewing the above noted solicitation I have discovered discrepancies and / or conflicts in the requirements for this project.&nbsp; Please provide clarification of which item should take precedence and provide the basis for our bid.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; B.2 Supplies Prices and Costs <br />This matrix requests&nbsp; <br />CLIN 0001 "Solid floor panels, Tate ConCore 2500 access floor panel with 1/16 ST61 IT ..."&nbsp; The panel named has a concentrated load rating of 2500 pounds.</p>
<p>2) C.2.4 Concentrated Load Strength <br />This paragraph states "A&nbsp; concentrated load of 1500 pounds..."&nbsp; This is in direct conflict with the concentrated load listed above.</p>
<p>The uniform, rolling and impact loads in section C are consistent with a ConCore 2500 panel.&nbsp; It appears that the Concentrated load listed in C.2.4 may be a typographic error, but I would appreciate written confirmation prior to submitting a firm price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Answer to&nbsp;Question 1:</strong> C.2.4 contains a typographical error. It should read "A concentrated load of 2500 pounds..."</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I have reviewed the above solicitation and believe that you may be replacing exisiting raised floor panels. If that is the case, please consider our On-Site re-surfacing service as a "Green" and fiscally more responsible approach. Each panel we are able to return to service reduces energy use by the btu equivalent of 2.6 bbls of oil, generates @ .86 manhours for local labor and saves up to 80% of the cost of purchasing and installing a new raised floor panel.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Answer to Question 2:</strong> No. There are (3) problems we have with pursuing this option. The first is that the existing tiles are 40 years old and have<br />wooden core and will not meet the concentrated load requirements of<br />today's high-density applications. The second is that we have a zinc<br />whisker problem with the existing tiles that can only be resolved by<br />replacing them. The final problem is that the structural grid<br />underneath the tiles is rusted through and will also be replaced. There<br />is no guarantee that the old tiles will fit properly onto the new grid<br />structure.</p>

<DESC>Question:<BR>Is there anything that you can add to the description? How durable?<BR><BR>Answer:<BR>Description listed is generic to promote innovative solutions by vendors and ensure we are not promoting a single brand.  As for durability, this will not be anything that will be pushed out of the back of a fixed wing-aircraft nor sling-loaded on a rotary-wing aircraft.  It simply needs to fit within the MAXIMUM dimensions for a 463L aircraft pallet.  It should be made out of a more durable material than your average refrigerator/cooler/freezer that one can buy at the appliance store.  I anticipate that the majority of its lifespan will be spent sitting in our Air Force warehouse plugged into an A/C outlet.  But, its other purpose it to be deployed to an austere environment and plugged into a generator for anywhere from three months to one year or longer.  More than likely this would include triple-digit summer temperatures and below freezing winter temperatures.  It would then need to stand the rigors of palletization and then flying back the home unit.<BR>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) System. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) requires an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system to be installed on a Zeiss Ultra 60 Field Emission (FE) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology's NanoFab Operations Group.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1)&nbsp;X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) system, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>EDS system quoted must be able to be installed on an existing Zeiss Ultra 60 Field Emission (FE) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)</p>
<p>1. EDS detector:</p>
<p>&bull; The energy dispersive X-ray detector must be a silicon drift chamber principle (SDD) unit, with no need for liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling</p>
<p>&bull; The detector must guarantee a minimum X-ray energy resolution of 129 eV at Mn K&alpha;. Resolution must be guaranteed in accordance with ISO15632:2002. Stronger consideration will be given to detectors that guarantee higher (lower energy) resolution</p>
<p>&bull; The detector must provide a total active area of &ge;50 mm&sup2; (to facilitate high-count rates at lower SEM beam energies and small SEM beam probe sizes). Stronger consideration will be given to larger active area detectors<br /><br />&bull; The detector must be enclosed in a vacuum to prevent the absorption of low energy X-rays by gas molecules between the detector window and the SDD sensor</p>
<p>2. EDS analysis software must:</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire and display EDS spectra, and spectral elemental maps and line scans</p>
<p>&bull; Synthesize spectra of compounds or pure element standards</p>
<p>&bull; Successfully correct for image drift while acquiring maps, line scans or spectra</p>
<p>&bull; Include a comprehensive X-ray pulse pile-up correction algorithm to remove sum peaks from the spectrum, and thus improve the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis</p>
<p>&bull; Include navigational software providing systematic guidance for inexperienced and/or infrequent users. Since the system will be installed in a multi-user facility (accessible to qualified NIST and external users) ease of use will be given strongest consideration</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date and add questions answers and a final drawing that were asked during the soliciation period.
Please ensure when you bid to include technical information and past perfomance per the solicitation instructions. The bid will be disqualified if the information is not received.

Per the drawing, no testing is required except that we would like to validate (fit check) the first set of bucks before additional bucks are manufactured.
The finish, both machining and paint are on the drawings.  The paint is code 3KQ per PES NI 010, I can provide this spec. if required.
1)The drawings are marked advanced copy, when will the final copy be available? sending fianl drawing with the amendment.
2) Is there any specification about testing? (ie. Mag Particle or any other inspection required)
3) Is there any specification about what kind of finish?

the "FAT" is a fit check for the fuselage contours.  No weight test is required.
I'm not sure if I am missing data about the First Article Test from this TDP. (is there any specifications on the FAT test and are there any requirement specification documentation on a weight test?)

<DESC>  Response to questions submitted by e-mail: The ALAAC/USDA Class A requirement mitigates the risk of awarding a contract to vendors that cannot provide healthy animals that are ready to enroll in studies within 5-7 days of arrival on Plum Island.  Animals that come from brokers, and on occasion from some class B vendors, tend to require long acclimation periods and medication for respiratory diseases prior to initiation of studies, all of which cost the government in husbandry and in time delays.
   Federal Regulations require that requirements under $5.5 million be set-aside for small business concerns.  Market research has shown that small business is capable of meeting the stated requirement.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>Solicitation: Project ZHTV0700191. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The  Period of Performance is 300 days.

NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M  Renovate Facility Phase 1, Facility 20011.  This project is phase I of a multi-phase whole building renovation plan. This phase includes complete replacement of all air handling units, the heat exchanger, electrical distribution switchboard and circuit breakers.  All restrooms will be completely replaced, some in different locations than the existing.  A new sanitary sewer line will be installed.  The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Special Requirement/Considerations: The building will remain occupied during this construction. Many of the new utility lines will be above the ceiling in the corridor requiring the contractor to plan his work to meet fire safety requirements for egress.  The air handler and associated ductwork replacement will need to be accomplished during the no heat/no cool time of the year requiring the contractor to plan ahead to have all his material on the site before he begins demolition.  The restroom work will be phased to allow the occupants to have access to at least one working restroom at all times during the construction. All this phasing of work will require the contractor to be able to manage multiple disciplines in order to minimize detrimental effects to building occupants.  Constant communication with the building occupants and the fire department will be critical.  The main occupants of this building are Air Force lawyers and the OSI.  An unscheduled power outage could cause a mission impact for these organizations and therefore is unacceptable.

Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

 In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The below was a question from a contractor to our customer requesting additional specification clarification:</p>
<p>1. Is there a specific brand or model size of excavator you are looking for, for example a cat 330 or 345? If so can we use a different machine with equivalent capabilities?</p>
<p><br />The CAT 330 or 345 (or equivalent) should work. Something comparable to the John Deere 350D LC would be good. It has a reach of approx 36 ft. But its 8 ton lift capacity reach is approx 20 ft. Its max dig depth is approx 24 ft. The machine will be placed in the creek bed by crane and will be digging down into the creek bed as well as into the side of the creek bank. The digging into the side of the bank could be up to approx 20 +/- ft above the creek bottom. Digging down below existing creek bottom could be approx 10+/- ft. Because the excavator will be placed by crane, if two excavators have similar capacity but different weight, we would prefer the lighter weight.</p>
<p>2. If you don't have a specific machine you are looking for we'll need more information on the lift capacities required. The RFQ asks for a machine that can lift 8 tons. Will that be over the front of the tracks or over the side? Also how high will the machine be required to lift 8 tons from ground level?</p>
<p>I would think one bucket with 2-3 CY capacity should work.</p>
<p>3. What size of bucket do you require, And if you need multiple buckets, and if you need a quick disconnect?</p>
<p>We would like a bucket WITH:</p>
<p>-Teeth</p>
<p>-Thumb combo (this requirement was with the original description - but not with the example I sent yesterday)</p>
<p>-A width of 48" to 60"</p>
<p>-2-3 CY capacity</p>
<p>4. What level of tier compliance does the machine require, if any?</p>
<p>The equip is subject to compliance with the California Air Resources Board and Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District which I believe would be Tier 2 or 3 depending on the hp or kw, date of manufacture, size of fleet, etc. Tier 4 compliance is coming in the future but not this year.</p>

____________________________6/11/09Amendment 1:  Answers to Questions
1)I have a quick question regarding notice # N40085-09-R-0206, and I was hoping that you could help me.  By any chance is this requirement a follow-on to contract # N40085-05-R-1005?  This requirement is not a follow-on contract.
2) Is there a page limit for the SF 330 submittal?  No.
3)  Can you please confirm that the due date for submittals is July 10, 2009?  Within the text of the solicitation (bottom of page 3) it states that all responses are due by May 30, 2008.  The synopsis has been revised to read the correct date, submittals are due July 10, 2009 at 2:00 p.m.
____________________________6/22/2009Amendment 2:  Answers to Questions
4)In the evaluation Factor #4, it requires an explanation on the company's ability to perform 5 taskings simultaneously. Could you please clarify the work load each tasking would entail.  In other words, what is the assigned value of each task order. For the purposes of this evaluation factor, use a task order range of $15,000 to $150,000 to estimate the workload.
5)I am writing to inquire about the IDIQ for A/E Services for Projects at Military Installations in the NAVFAC Midlant Public Works Department Little Creek and Oceana Areas?  Is cost estimating considered a part of the team?  Yes.

<p>This is a time-and-materials contract. This procurement was not awarded as a fixed-price contract because it was not possible at the time of award of the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. The high degree of complexity and uniqueness of the requirement to the Government did not make a fixed-price contract suitable (FAR16.601(c)).</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This is a modification to an existing contract task order. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District issued a task order modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds on contract task order DACW41-99-D-9001-0005. The project was competed as a Site Specific Environmental Restoration Contract (SSERC) under solicitation number DACW41-98-R-0034. The contract was awarded to Shaw Environmental, Inc. formerly Stone and Webster Environmental and Technology Services (CAGE CODE: 1YN99). This is a modification to a remedial action contract for the removal of radioactive contaminated waste located at the FUSRAP Maywood Superfund Site, Maywood, New Jersey. This work is for remedial action at the designated areas of Myron Property, Sears Area 5, Stepan area 13, 15 and 18, and Burial Pit #1, all located at the FUSRAP Maywood Superfund Site, Maywood, New Jersey.<BR><BR>The objective of this remediation project is to remove radiological contaminated soil and material and restore the site to pre-existing conditions.  This will require pre and post-excavation waste characterization sampling; radiological monitoring, design and construction of excavation areas; excavation; operation of a temporary water treatment system during excavation dewatering activities; physical separation of excavated material with different waste classifications; and off-site transportation of contaminated soils and material.<BR><BR>Procurement of a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to the existing SSERC Task Order will offer significant flexibility for responding to conditions that are unexpected, such as the removal of uncertain soil volume quantities and unknown buried materials.  Additionally, the USACE Maywood project team is capable and prepared to provide qualified staff for monitoring contractor performance to mitigate risks and to ensure that all alternatives have been considered.  The project team is also able and has experience to monitor the task order to ensure that performance, cost and schedule goals are being met, including but not limited to: implementing quality assurance procedures established for the contract, and completing timely contractor performance evaluations that accurately reflect the contractors actual performance. <BR>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>N61339-09-R-0041
<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Navy’s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program for academic and simulator training on the C-26E aircraft (a Navy configured Metroliner SA227). The avionics upgraded (ProLine 21) C-26E has replaced the C-26B. A commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract is anticipated with a 60-month period of performance commencing on or about 18 Nov 2009. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611512, size standard $25.5 million. This acquisition is anticipated to be conducted in accordance with FAR 6.1, Full and Open Competition. For informational purposes only, the incumbent contractor for these services is Flight Safety International. 

The following C-26E specific individual courses are required: C-26E Initial Training Course, C-26E Prior Experience Training Course, and C-26E Recurrent Training Course. All courses shall include, as part of the curriculum, upgraded Avionics/Cockpit Differences Training, which shall consist of a Computer Based Training (CBT) or hands-on trainer for classroom use. The Cockpit Differences Training shall provide the student with hands-on system and procedural differences training between the C-26B without the upgraded Avionics and the C-26E with upgraded Avionics. The C-26E courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Metroliner SA227 aircraft at time of training. For all courses, the contractor shall provide: all the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course. Initial course and Prior Experience course attendees will be designated Naval Aviators (pilots) or Naval Flight Officers (NFOs). C-26E Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-26E Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-26E Initial Course. These C-26E CACT program training courses require classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability, and an FAA certified Level C (or higher), SA227DC simulator configured as a Navy C-26E. In lieu of the CFT or PTT, a higher order device may be used. Cockpit Differences Training will be used for training pilots/NFOs on the ProLine 21 (upgraded avionics) modified C-26E and may use Computer Based Training (CBT) or other hands-on, interactive training as a substitute for a PTT. Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed. Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein. All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-26E Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi. The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval. C-26E training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification. 

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit literature, brochures, and capability summaries identifying, at a minimum, business size and past (limit to within 3 years) and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact). Brevity of extraneous information is desired. Information should be sent via e-mail to jana.mirrilees@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods are via facsimile to (407) 380-4164 Attn: Code 25341 (Alan Wright) or by mail to: NAWC TSD, ATTN: Code 25342 (Jana Mirrilees), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275. Responses are requested by 6 April 2009. The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists at this time.

NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Navy’s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program for academic and simulator training on the C-26E aircraft (a Navy configured Metroliner SA227).   The avionics upgraded (ProLine 21) C-26E has replaced the C-26B. A commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract is anticipated with a 60-month period of performance commencing on or about 18 Nov 2009.  North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611512, size standard $25.5 million.  This acquisition is anticipated to be conducted in accordance with FAR 6.1, Full and Open Competition.  For informational purposes only, the incumbent contractor for these services is Flight Safety International.  

The following C-26E specific individual courses are required:  C-26E Initial Training Course, C-26E Prior Experience Training Course, and C-26E Recurrent Training Course. All courses shall include, as part of the curriculum, upgraded Avionics/Cockpit Differences Training, which shall consist of a Computer Based Training (CBT) or hands-on trainer for classroom use. The Cockpit Differences Training shall provide the student with hands-on system and procedural differences training between the C-26B without the upgraded Avionics and the C-26E with upgraded Avionics.  The C-26E courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Metroliner SA227 aircraft at time of training.  For all courses, the contractor shall provide: all the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Initial course and Prior Experience course attendees will be designated Naval Aviators (pilots) or Naval Flight Officers (NFOs).  C-26E Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-26E Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-26E Initial Course.  These C-26E CACT program training courses require classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability, and an FAA certified Level C (or higher), SA227DC simulator configured as a Navy C-26E.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT, a higher order device may be used. Cockpit Differences Training will be used for training pilots/NFOs on the ProLine 21 (upgraded avionics) modified C-26E and may use Computer Based Training (CBT) or other hands-on, interactive training as a substitute for a PTT. Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-26E Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-26E training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification. 

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit literature, brochures, and capability summaries identifying, at a minimum, business size and past (limit to within 3 years) and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact).  Brevity of extraneous information is desired.  Information should be sent via e-mail to jana.mirrilees@navy.mil.
