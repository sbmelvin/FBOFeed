<DESC>The Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) at the American Consulate General, Frankfurt, on behalf of the Bureau of Human Resources (HR) and the Embassies/Consulates in Africa, intends to issue a solicitation for a regional health insurance contract in FY2011. We are in the market research phase and need industry to provide their interest and information that will allow a successful contract arrangement. We invite qualified and interested companies to provide us their profiles, possible suggestions, and record of experience. <br />
<p>To be considered qualified; companies are required to have experience in providing health insurance in foreign countries, some of which are in hostile environments, lack good health care infrastructure and have clients to whom health insurance is a new concept. If your firm or principle managers have never provided overseas health insurance in a multi country environment please do not waste your, or my, time responding to this advertisement.</p>
<p>The Government is neither allowed, nor wants, to create a solicitation geared towards the practices and procedures of any one company. However, this is your opportunity to assist us in issuing a package that does not contradict the industry's norms. We desire to produce the best possible contract that is acceptable to both parties within the framework of the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>The information received will also be used to make basic decisions on coverage areas, type of contract, line item structure, number of contracts required to ensure continental coverage and what tasks the Department of State will have to keep in house. All information received will be considered and a draft solicitation issued on FEDBIZOPPs for industry comment in January 2011. Some firms may be contacted for additional pre-solicitation market research.</p>
<p>The insurance coverage is intended for the locally employed staff at the Department of State Embassies and Consulates in Africa to include the Mediterranean coast countries of northern Africa and Islands off the coast. However, the resulting solicitation may also require coverage for other personnel working in Africa with any Department of the U.S. Government under various employment arrangements. It is not intended to cover Government direct hires (civil service and Foreign Service) transferred from the United States. It has been decided that each country must have its own benefit package to be determined by DoS Human Relations based on normal health benefits in the particular country. This is a firm requirement.</p>
<p>The insurance shall cover pre-existing conditions (including HIV / AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, etc), routine medical / dental care and emergency services for covered employees and their immediate families. The performance period will be 12 months with four (4) separate one-year options.</p>
<p>Please submit your company profiles, industry comments, and experience to email address FrankfurtRPSO@state.gov, with a cc to HeckC@state.gov, by December 10, 2010.&nbsp; Please include your company's full address, telephone number, e-mail address and a point of contact.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-2
<AWDNBR>VA600-C10090
<ARCHDATE>12252010
<DESC>
1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VA Long Beach Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as directed by the VA Long beach Healthcare System will enter into a Purchase Order that requires justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Specialized lab reagents for the use of diagnosing potential fatal infectious diseases for VA Long beach Hospital instrumentation.  Due to the nature of these tests, these reagents must be purchased due to an unusual and compelling basis. 

3. Description of Requirement:  The awarded contractor is to provide specialized Cervista HPV High Risk Tests and HPV 16/18 test kits for the Cervista instrumentation currently in use at the VA Long beach Hospital. The estimated cost is $28800.
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The product(s) are being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-2(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: FAR Part 6.302-2 allows for the use of other than full and open market competitive procedures when an agency's need for supplies or services presents an unusual and compelling urgency and delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government.  Due to the nature of the disease that this test detects, there is an urgent need to procure these items in an expedited manner.  Failure to do so could lead to misdiagnosis of cervical cancer potentially leading to improper treatment and death of a patient.  The government would be seriously harmed in that a patient within their healthcare system has perished due to the lack of an item that could have been purchased through other than full and open market procedures.  Thus this item must be purchased through other than open market procedures to ensure successful treatment of patients within the VA Long beach Healthcare system under FAR Part 6.302-2. 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  Significant market research has been carried out to determine potential vendors that can provide the items required within this procurement.  Due to the nature of the instrumentation used, Third Wave Technologies is the only provider of reagents for this system, however there are other instruments that could be purchased in the future to fulfill the same function of this instrument.  A competed contract/blanket purchase agreement shall be put into place to address this concern within six months.  A notice shall be posted for the award of this purchase order.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable when compared to other HPV test kits.

8. Results of Market Survey: Market research indicates that other instrumentation is currently present to detect HPV, though Third Wave Technologies is the only contractor that provides Cervista specific reagents and test kits.  The process of procuring other instrumentation would require six-twelve months of procurement and implementation.  The implementation of another instrument requires three-six months of testing and certification to be fully operational.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The Government shall solicit for additional solutions that fulfill the role of the Cervista instrument to meet the needs of not only VA Long beach, but for the entire VISN to save costs and ensure patient healthcare is properly maintained. 

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
