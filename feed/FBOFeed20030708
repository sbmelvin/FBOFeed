<DESC>This contract shall provide for the collection and delivery of  serum specimens suitable for the validation of assays for distinguishing recent from longstanding infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  Suitable panels are to include specimens from persons with all known viral subtypes of HIV-1.

The contractor(s) shall obtain and deliver specimen sets from persons who have seroconverted to HIV-1.  Either of two methods may be used.  For Method 1, the contractor may identify and gain access to seroconversion specimens which meet the criteria that have already been collected for other purposes (e.g., as part of longitudinal studies).  For Method 2, the contractor shall develop a mechanism for identifying persons who have recently become infected with HIV-1 after previously testing negative, obtain the first HIV-1 antibody-positive specimen and prospectively collect 3 serum specimens over a period of one year from the first antibody positive specimen.
	
C.2.2.  BACKGROUND AND NEED

Infection with HIV-1 is most commonly diagnosed by the detection of antibodies to components of the virus in serum or plasma.  Once an individual is infected, circulating antibodies persist throughout the years-long course of HIV disease.  Determining whether newly diagnosed infections are recent has important epidemiologic implications for calculating incidence of HIV infection, that is, the number of new cases per year.  Incidence measurements are essential to help to identify recent patterns of transmission, and to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission of the virus.  Identifying recent infection may also have implications for clinical treatment, as some evidence suggests specific therapeutic regimens offered shortly after infection may have benefit for improving the long-term course of HIV disease.

Several in vitro diagnostic strategies have been developed to distinguish incident (recent) from prevalent (longstanding) infection by detecting differences in antibody responses to HIV-1 early in the course of infection.  These assays differ in their sensitivity for recent infection, and in the time identified by the assay as recent, that is, the period after infection with the virus during which the assay gives a definitive result (referred to as the window period).  For some assays, the duration of this window period appears to differ with specimens from persons infected with different viral subtypes of HIV-1.  For the purpose of calculating incidence, the optimal window period is 150-180 days.  Evaluating candidate assays and accurately determining the length of the window period for different viral subtypes require panels of specimens from persons who have been recently infected with HIV-1 and seroconverted (that is, developed an antibody response to the virus).  
 
The necessary specimen panel requires:

a)The date of the last negative HIV test;
b)The date of the first positive HIV test, less than 1 year after the last negative test;
c)Four or more specimens (including the first positive specimen) spaced approximately 3 months apart.

It is not essential that specimens be evenly spaced, but the specimen set must span a period of at least one year after the first positive test.

To date, evaluation of candidate assays have used specimens from recently infected persons (seroconverter panels) collected as part of longitudinal studies, or collected by commercial firms, often from blood or plasma donors who have become infected with HIV.  Such seroconverter panels are scare, especially those with specimens spanning at least one year after seroconversion.  Lack of suitable seroconverter specimen sets impedes the development and evaluation of assays for recent infection.
									
C.2.3.  CONTRACT PURPOSE
	
The contractor(s) shall obtain and deliver specimen sets from persons who have seroconverted to HIV-1.  Two methods may be used by the contractor or the contractor’s subcontractor.  For the first method, the contractor may identify and gain access to seroconversion specimens which meet the criteria that have already been collected for other purposes (e.g., as part of longitudinal studies).  For the second method, the contractor or the contractor’s subcontractor shall develop a mechanism for identifying persons who have recently become infected with HIV-1 (e.g., persons who become antibody positive after recently testing antibody negative, or persons who are p24 antigen positive but HIV antibody negative), obtain the first HIV-1 antibody-positive specimen and prospectively collect 3 serum specimens over a period of one year from the first antibody positive specimen.

C.2.4.	SCOPE OF WORK
	
A. The contractor shall provide labor, technology, materials, supplies, equipment, travel, transportation, and other incidentals necessary to acquire the necessary panels of serum specimens and transport the specimens to the CDC storage facility in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

B. The contractor must identify and acquire panels of at least four specimens from the same individual that meet the following criteria:

1) The first HIV-1 antibody positive specimen from a person known to have seroconverted to HIV-1, for whom the date of a previous negative test is available and known to be less than one year from the first positive test; or from a person with other laboratory evidence of recent seroconversion (e.g., HIV p24 antigen positive, HIV antibody negative);

2) Three subsequent specimens spaced approximately three months apart, with the last specimen collected at least one year but less than two years after the first positive specimen.

<DESC>The position has been classified at a GS-13 equivalency with a salary range of $61,251 to $79,629 plus overseas allowances.  The period of performance will be one year with possibility of a six-month or one year extension provided that there is a continuing need for the services, funds are available and satisfactory or better performance by the Contractor.  This position is open to qualified U.S. citizens.
 
I.                   Organizational Location of Position: Lusaka, Zambia
 
II.        Position Title of Direct Supervisor: 
 
The Population, Health and Nutrition (PHN) Deputy Team Leader will be supervised by and report to the Director of the PHN office, who is also the PHN Team Leader. The Deputy Team Leader shall work closely with other members of the USG Country Team.
 
III.       Supervisory Controls:
 
The incumbent will have a broad development background and USAID experience, and will carry out the functions of this position, based on general procedural guidelines and strategic/policy direction from the PHN Team Leader.
 
IV.       Background:
 
USAID/Zambia seeks an experienced PHN professional, who will undertake the duties of Strategic Objective (SO) Deputy Team Leader for the Population, Health and Nutrition Strategic Objective (SO3/SO7), under the supervision of the PHN Team Leader.
 
 
USAID/Zambia Program:
 
The Population, Health and Nutrition program is the largest in USAID/Zambia’s portfolio. The final FY 03 budget is anticipated to be approximately $38 million--76% of the Mission’s annual program resources and one of the largest in Africa.  The current Strategic Objective (SO3), “Increased Use of Integrated Child and Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS Interventions” includes activities in HIV/AIDS, family planning/reproductive health, child health, vitamin A, malaria, and health system strengthening.  These are being implemented through 5 bilateral agreements, over 20 USAID Washington central activities (several of whom have an in-country presence), several USAID Washington PVO grantees, regional projects, and USAID’s only active non-project assistance agreement in the health sector. 
 
USAID/Zambia’s health program works within the framework of the Government of Zambia’s (GRZ) National Health Strategic Plan and collaborates closely with the GRZ and other donors to provide assistance in support of this plan. The SO works with the public, private and NGO sectors and undertakes activities at the national, provincial, district and community levels. USAID/Zambia has been designated as a Plus-Up country for malaria work, a Rapid Scale-Up country for HIV/AIDS, a recipient of funds under the President’s Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission of HIV Initiative, and a target country for an overall increase in HIV/AIDS funding under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The PHN team currently has 9 staff members, including 2 USAID direct hires, 3 TAACS/Fellows, 3 professional Foreign Service National (FSN) staff and one FSN admistrative staffperson.
 
USAID/Zambia is in the process of developing a new Mission Strategy. The current Strategy ends September 30, 2003.  Current SO3 activities have been extended through September 30, 2004 in order to provide a reasonable period for transition to activities under the new Strategy. The PHN portfolio will fall under SO7, “Improved Health Status of Zambians.” The PHN Deputy Team Leader will work closely with the Team Leader and the SO3/SO7 Team to manage ongoing and new activities and to facilitate the transition from the current Strategy to the new one.
 
Country Context
 
Zambia has seen some positive health trends in recent years but the picture is very mixed. HIV/AIDS is an overwhelming development challenge, with 16% percent of Zambian adults infected. In addition to the burden on families, communities and health systems of caring for the ill, there are a growing number of orphans in the society. New HIV infections appear to be declining as high-risk sexual behaviors become less common, although mortality is likely to continue climbing for at least a few more years. USAID is actively involved in the following areas: communication for behavior change, social marketing, advocacy (including through faith based organizations and traditional leaders), Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission, voluntary counseling and testing, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children, clinical treatment of HIV-related illnesses, workplace HIV programs, policy, and support to the health system.
 
Between 1996 and 2001/2, under-five mortality dropped 15% from 197 to 168/1000. Malaria and HIV/AIDS have been the two principal causes of death in this age group. Malaria incidence has increased at least three-fold over the past two decades and is currently the leading cause of death among children. USAID is involved in both increasing the availability and use of insecticide-treated bednets and in improving case detection and management, both of which are expected to show important impact in the next few years. Vitamin A deficiency, which had made a substantial contribution to under-5 mortality in the past, is declining due to high supplement coverage achieved in recent years. USAID continues to support this effort. 
 
Malnutrition has worsened in Zambia and presents a major challenge for USAID’s next Strategy period. Stunting has increased and now affects about half of children under-5s (47%, up from 40% in 1992). Maternal mortality also increased: from 649/100,000 live births in 1996 to 729 in 2001/2. The vast majority of Zambian women receive some antenatal care. However, most deliveries are not attended by a health professional. Furthermore, antenatal care frequently does not include key interventions, with only 20% of women receiving at least 90 days of iron/folate supplementation. USAID continues to focus on activities to make safe motherhood a priority and to improve antenatal, delivery and postnatal services. 
 
Family planning use has become much more widespread. The contraceptive prevalence rate is now 39% in urban areas. However, rural residents lag far behind (14%). USAID works in family planning social marketing, IEC, training, advocacy, and policy. 
 
Zambia is implementing a system of health reforms. Current challenges include shortage of health workers, inadequate transport, and problems in regularly accessing drugs and medical supplies. USAID provides support in HMIS, planning, policy, drug management, logistics, and health care financing. USAID is the largest donor in the health sector and participates in the active ongoing coordination and collaboration between the GRZ and sector donors. 
 
Life In Zambia
 
Zambia is a wonderful country to live and work in. It has historically been a calm, peaceful nation. Ongoing economic difficulties and the heavy impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in all sectors provide ample professional challenges. However, the Zambians the Mission works with are excellent colleagues--hard working and extremely dedicated to improving the health status of people throughout the country. 
 
The capital, Lusaka, offers a comfortable living environment with a mild climate, an excellent American school (as well as several other international schools), a large variety of goods easily available from major shops, good electricity and phone service.  The country abounds with opportunities for game viewing, bird watching, camping, canoeing/rafting, walking and other outdoor activities. The game parks are some of the best in the region. Victoria Falls is an easy half-day drive from Lusaka.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research leading to revolutionary advances in imaging sensor systems obtained through the intelligent integration of today’s advanced capabilities within the individual optical, detection, and processing subsystems. It is envisioned that such integration will be enabled by recent advances in system optimization methods, which provide an emerging capability for co-design and joint optimization of the optical, detection, and processing aspects of imaging systems. This new approach stands in marked contrast to traditional design practice involving separate optimization of each subsystem within the confines of its conventional function.  It is anticipated that the MONTAGE program will consider imaging system designs in which the traditional roles of subsystems are modified significantly and may even merge, enabling dramatic new formats and capabilities.
 
A particular objective of this program is the systematic exploration of the trade-offs among analog optical processing as realized by pre-detection optics, on-chip processing within sensor arrays, and post-detection digital processing.  The impact of these trades on systems-level performance is of particular concern.  In particular, the output from imaging systems is often used in image exploitation tasks like target detection, identification and tracking.  Consequently, optimization of systems with respect to performance relevant to image exploitation tasks is one of the goals of MONTAGE.

In pursuit of these program goals DARPA is soliciting proposals detailing research, design, demonstration, and validation of MONTAGE imaging systems. It is anticipated that the resulting systems concepts will provide radical improvements in the capabilities, functions, and formats of imaging systems for DoD applications. Several specific directions for advance have been selected for demonstration at this stage as indicated below.  For more details along with relevant figures of merit and criteria, please refer to the Proposer Information Pamphlet described in the GENERAL INFORMATION Section.

Current imaging systems for visible and thermal wavelengths employ standard lenses to form an image in the focal plane, where the light intensity distribution is converted into electrical signals by a high resolution detector array.  The resultant signals may then be post-processed by a digital subsystem in order to perform calibration, noise suppression or other higher-level operations (such as segmentation, recognition).  The performance of the system is often quantified in terms of the total field of view, the angular resolution (ability to distinguish two closely spaced point objects) and signal-to-noise ratio.  These performance parameters are impacted in a complex, interrelated manner by the choice of aperture and focal length of the optical subsystem, the pixel size and total number of pixels in the detector array, and finally by the algorithms applied to detector output in the digital post-processing subsystem.

Deployment of high performance imaging systems on a wide variety of platforms (dismounted soldiers, ground vehicles, UAVs) is impacted by the system form factor, which is dictated largely by the aspect ratio of width-to-depth. In conventional imaging systems this is primarily determined by the aperture (width) and focal length (depth) of the imaging optics.  Since the focal length is typically greater than the aperture diameter, these systems are “deep.” Beyond the obvious impact of this fact on the geometric “fit” of the imager with the platform, there are often important implications for many other properties of the imaging system, such as its weight and angular moment of inertia.  The main focus of the MONTAGE program is to develop new imaging sensors with radically different form, fit, and function as compared to existing systems.

Research efforts in this program will be structured in three successive phases. Advancement of specific research projects from one phase to the next will be determined by review of research progress according to the criteria given below. The primary goal of Phase I is to change dramatically the form factor of the imaging sensor by reducing its depth by one order of magnitude with respect to a corresponding conventional system while maintaining performance in terms of angular resolution and light gathering ability.  Another goal of Phase I effort will be to implement required image processing on a PC-like platform in less than one second.  Phase II efforts will build upon the accomplishments of Phase I and will extend the performance of the imaging system in the total field of view and angular resolution while retaining the reduced depth achieved in Phase I.  The processing time for image formation will also be reduced to less than 100 milliseconds.  New functionalities of conformal deployment on curved surfaces and programmable angular resolution over different regions will be demonstrated in Phase II.  The potential for reducing the depth by another order of magnitude beyond Phase I goal and improving angular resolution beyond the diffraction limits of the coherent collection aperture of the imaging system will also be explored in Phase II.  This phase will begin immediately after the successful conclusion of Phase I and will last 18 months.  Phase III, lasting 12 months, will pursue the transition of the most promising concepts to specific DoD applications identified during Phase II. 

Teaming is encouraged and the viability of teaming arrangements should be clearly explained in the proposal abstracts.  Emphasis will be placed on integrated approaches, i.e., integrated teams formed to better address the many different technological and scientific aspects of the MONTAGE Sensors program.   Proposals involving individual investigators or investigator teams of narrower expertise may be appropriate if they show strong potential applicability to the broad MONTAGE goals, including a clear mechanism for ultimately integrating successful developments into full sensor system development.  Teaming between industries, universities, and/or federal and national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged.   

This announcement is soliciting proposals addressing the Phase I, II, and III activities.  Phase II and III activities should be proposed as optional tasks starting nineteen months after the beginning of the effort.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-16 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not  be issued. The government intends to issue multiple awards. The NAICS is  332995. The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is soliciting for White Papers for the concept,  construction, and demonstration of a CROP Handler and Transporter (CHAT)  prototype that will be used to demonstrate the loading and unloading of CROPs  from containers an ability to load and transport a 20 foot ISO container (See  Enclosure: Crop Handler and Transporter Phase I Effort: Statement of Work)  White papers are to be no greater than 20 pages in length, not including cover,  table of contents, or associated figures or charts, and must address those  requirements stated in the CHAT requirements document. The CROP has become the  Army's standard means for moving ammunition.  It is a 20' long x 71/2'feet wide  platform that has a large A-frame on one end.  This A-frame interfaces with a  hydraulic lifting mechanism on a PLS truck or a HEMTT-LHS, and it allows the  vehicle operator to pick up the CROP for transport or place it back on the  ground.  20' ISO containers can be moved in the same manner utilizing a  Container Handling Unit or CHU.  The PLS and HEMTT-LHS systems are not fully  utilized in the depot area and a less hardened version is sought, this concept  will be known as the CHAT.  More specifically, the CHAT will be a less robust  version of the PLS/HEMTT-LHS without the rough terrain capabilities with the  addition of the capability of handling 463L pallets and type-5 heavy drop  platforms.  The CHAT can be truck or trailer variant.  The expected period of  performance for this effort will be 60-120 days after contract award.  Multiple  contract awards are expected, and there may be downselect criteria after this  effort or after any subsequent efforts.

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, LETTER-WRITTEN, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION (RFP) FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.   Instead, all prospective offerors must retrieve the solicitation from this FedBizOpps web site, when the solicitation is hereafter published.  This is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE procurement.   There is no incumbent contractor who is eligible to propose on this procurement.  Under this procurement, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a CONTRACT under which the contractor will provide assistance to develop a community website for the FHWA’s Truck Size & Weight Program activities.  It is anticipated that the website will AUTOMATE the entire process by which:  (a) states certify that they are complying with STATE laws relating to the size and weight of trucks; and (b) the FHWA certifies that states are complying with FEDERAL requirements.   The contractor will:  provide for website user authentication and authorization via user IDs and passwords; create a reference library that includes documents associated with the truck size and weight program; create on-going opinion polls to gather stakeholder information and provide feedback to stakeholders; create a website discussion room on various topics of interest to stakeholders; track visitors to the website, by member name, and provide information on recent visitors to new visitors; create and maintain a What’s New section in the website; create and maintain a Contributions section in the website; create a Noteboard tool for announcements and informal discussion; create a Lists tool and Calendars in the website; create an Images sharing tool, a Files tool, a Chat tool, a Community Messenger tool, a Member List tool, an Invite Others tool, a Feedback tool, and a Preferences tool; create a Membership Groups and Permissions feature, a Polling feature, a New or Unread Indicator feature, a User Interface feature, a Community Explorer tool, a Full Text Search feature, a Related Content feature, an Optional Community Previewing feature, a Full Content Moderation tool, an Improved Community Affiliation feature; ensure that adequate Physical Security is provided for the website’s hosting facility; provide for a multi-tier System Architecture that ensures that database, file and application servers are never communicating directly with end-users; create Hardware Redundancy by utilizing multiple servers for the website; create Data Backup and Recovery features; provide for Secure Communications during all communications with the Community website; provide for Data Storage; determine, with the FHWA, which states may be selected as pilot states; manage access to the website by all authorized users; continue to support the website for three years after its development has been completed; provide training manuals for access to and use of the website; provide hands-on training to states and to the U. S. Department of Transportation, upon request; scan into the system each state’s Certification and State Enforcement Plans for the past three years; and scan letters, regulatory guidance, interpretation and other documents the FHWA deems relevant to the website.   To be competitive, an offeror’s proposal will probably need to:  (a) demonstrate that the offeror possesses in-depth technical experience in the design, implementation, management and support of a secure community website; (b) demonstrate that the offeror possesses competence in technical writing with special emphasis on the preparation of requirements and documentation including software and user manuals; (c) demonstrate that the offeror possesses knowledge of the FHWA’s Size & Weight regulatory requirements and how they can be enforced through the operation of the website.  THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS SYNOPSIS, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA’S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED.  The FHWA’s best current ESTIMATE is that the solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps web site on or about July 31, 2003.   Any prospective offeror who retrieves the solicitation must be sure to frequently RE-CHECK FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the solicitation.  Re-checking for such amendments is IMPERATIVE, because amendments usually contain crucial information.

Description
 
Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to recompete its Contracted Advisory and Assistance Services (CAAS) contract to meet its continuing requirement for contracted support on a worldwide basis within the broad range of advisory and assistance services.  The government is combining the ACC TEOMS (F44650-00-R-0001) and the ACC CAAS (F44650-01-R-0001) acquisitions into one procurement.  The RFP solicitation number (F44650-01-R-0001) remains the same, however the title of the acquisition is changed to CAAS II.  This covers three major categories of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS):  Management and Professional Support services; Studies, Analyses, and Evaluations; and Engineering and Technical.  All HQ ACC directorates are considered primary using activities for this contract effort; however, other organizations and agencies assigned to directly support HQ ACC may require similar CAAS services on an as needed basis.  CAAS II will be used to complement the Government_s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  Information concerning the current contract can be found at http://www2.acc.af.mil/lg/Cons/Lgcu/CAAS/CAASHome.html.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring the EPS web pages for further information concerning this source selection, including the release of the solicitations and all subsequent amendments and correspondence related to the solicitation.  Offerors must download the RFP from the web page; no hard copies will be mailed. 
 
Initial notifications outlined this acquisition to be commercial in nature. After further 
 review of this strategy, this acquisition will be converted to non-commercial.  This change in strategy is being driven by the government_s inability to include any type of cost-reimbursement CLIN in a commercial acquisition.  We would like to apologize to all interested offerors for the delay in the release of the CAAS II RFP.  Release of the RFP in the non-commercial format is scheduled for on or about 15 February 2001.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular and Defense Acquisition Circular at the time of this RFQ.  The standard industrial classification code is 3491 - Industrial Valves and the small business size standard is 500.  This procurement is being conducted as a total small business set-aside.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is for fifteen  (15) each four (4) inch combination pressure reducing, surge control and solenoid shutoff valves equipped with opening and closing speed controls, CLA-VAL model #90AF-4H-5A 150lb flanged globe, or equal, identified in this RFQ as Line Item 0001.  The valves must be single-seated globe type, diaphragm actuated, hydraulically operated valves.  Valves shall consist of three (3) major components: the valve body, valve cover, and diaphragm assembly.  The diaphragm assembly shall be the only moving part.  In the event of diaphragm failure, valve shall fail closed against flow, unless otherwise indicated.  The main valve shall be drip-tight when closed.  Each valve shall have an external indicator to show the position of the valve disc at all times.    Control valves shall be shipped from the factory as a complete assembly with valve.  Materials which come in contact with the fuel shall be resistant to the effects of and not harmful to aircraft engine fuel and shall be aluminum or stainless steel unless noted otherwise  (High level shut-off valve bodies shall be electroless nickel plated ductile iron).  Each four (4) inch combination pressure reducing, surge control and solenoid shutoff valve is a normally closed solenoid/pilot operated flow control valve, which is typically used for simple (single stage) flow control at aviation fuel stands.  The valve has five main features: solenoid shutoff, pressure reducing, surge control, opening speed control, and closing speed control.  The valve is to be used with components of the Scully Signal Company Single Point Overfill Prevention System to be installed on aircraft fuel fillstands for the purpose of monitoring and limiting the transfer of fuel between the fillstands and aircraft refueling vehicles.  More specifically, with regard to use of the valve with the Scully system, the control signal (120 VAC Hot) must pass through the two Scully Signal Company control unit relay output contacts (located in the single compartment overfill prevention control monitor, Scully model no. ST-15-ELK/D, part no. 08747; and the loading rack to refueler automatic self proving ground system, Scully model no. ST-47-115-ELK, part no. 08220) and then to the valve.When both the ST-15 and ST-47 are permissive, the valve will open.  When either the Scully sensor is wet (overfill condition) or the ground to the refueler is lost, the valve will close.  Alternately, if the fillstand has a start/stop push button station for a loading pump, the control signal identified above is wired to this station (as a slave device) rather than directly to the valve.  In this case, when both Scully units are permissive, the start/stop station will receive control power (AC Hot signal).  When the start button is pushed, the pump will start and the control valve will open simultaneously.  Delivery of the valves must be made FOB destination on or about 7 Sep 99.  A total of fifteen (15) valves will be delivered to two locations.  Eleven (11) valves will be delivered to Nellis AFB NV 89191-7227.  Four (4) valves will be delivered to Moody AFB GA 31699-1794. The Air Force intends to conduct this procurement in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors_Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications_Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions_Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders_Commercial Items, with paragraph (b), clauses (1), (3), (5), (6), (7), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), and (22) are checked; and 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC), is tasked to provide the services required to support the cold storage maintenance services for the Over-the Horizon Backscatter (OTH-B) Radar System sites.   The contractor will be required to provide all labor, material, and supervision necessary to maintain the OTH-B Radar System in a caretaker status.

The ECRS consists of three geographic locations on the East Coast of the US.  The transmit and receive sites are located near Moscow, Maine and Columbia Fall, Maine and are approximately 100 miles apart.  There is one operations center at Bangor Air National Guard Base (ANGB), Maine.  The WCRS also consists of three geographic locations.  The West Coast transmit and receive sites are located near Christmas Valley, Oregon and Tulelake California and are approximately 150 miles apart.  The West Coast Operations Center is located at Mountain Home Air Force Base (MAFB), Idaho.  ACC is conducting market research in an attempt to set aside this acquisition through the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program.   All HUBZone certified contractors are encouraged to respond to this announcement.   Anticipated contract award date is 1 October 2002.  The projected period of performance is from 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003, with 4 one-year option periods.   Estimated contract value is $1 to $5 million.  This is not a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and no contract will result from this synopsis nor does it commit the government to any acquisition for these services. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay for any information received.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release. 

The NAICS code for this effort is anticipated to be 56121. 

If you have interest in this requirement, you are requested to submit your company name, address and phone number; HUBZone Certification, and a point of contact to the ACC CONS e-mail addresses below. 

In an effort to streamline the process of acquiring documentation, the government intends to post copies of current contract information, draft documents associated with this proposal and questions/answers relating to the acquisition on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) (http://www.fedbizops.gov).  An Industry Conference will be scheduled in the future for all interest offerors.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting for a construction contractor to remove and encapsulate the identified areas where PCB amended paints exist in the Juneau Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse.  PROJECT OVERVIEW:  The Juneau Federal Building needs to maintain a safe operation and use of the facility by its tenants, users, and maintenance staff by removal or encapsulation of PCB amended paints identified to be existing at the parking garage, stairs and handrails, floors, and walls, in conformance with EPA regulations.  Removal of PCB amended paints can be accomplished using mechanical and chemical processes depending on the existing coating and substrate material.  Paint removal from concrete floors will require shot blasting, hydro blasting or grinding.  SELECTION PROCESS: This procurement is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a negotiated request for proposal process.  The successful offeror will be the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest request for proposal price.  The following criteria will be utilized as evaluation factors for award.  

1.  Prime contractor or subcontractor shall have demonstrated five years experience in Hazardous Materials Abatement/Remediation.  Highlight any experience with PCB Abatement/Remediation.

2.  Provide construction methodology and proposed management strategies geared strictly to PCB abatement

3.  Provide documentation to demonstrate contractor's past performance:

5. List key personnel and organizational structure.

Technical Proposals shall be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE or NOT-ACCEPTABLE basis only.  Price is considered equally important to the Technical Evaluation Factors.  For those proposals which have been deemed technically acceptable, price will become the deciding factor upon which award will be made.  Accordingly, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and at the lowest price.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between two hundred fifty thousand dollars and five hundred thousand dollars ($250,000.00 and $500,000.00).  The approximate duration of the contract is four months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.

Disciplines and services required may include but may not be limited to, architectural, electrical, mechanical, structural, civil and geotechnical engineering, cost estimating, elevator, fire safety and hazardous materials consultant services.  

Multiple firms may be selected from this solicitation.  The duration of the base contract will be one year.  The contract will include a provision for four (4) renewal options.  Each option will extend the contract for an additional one (1) year period and may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  The maximum ordering limitation is $750,000.00 for each one (1) year period.  The selected firm must negotiate overhead and profit rates and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines for use in negotiating fixed price work orders.  The selected firm must submit to a GSA audit prior to negotiations.  For projects with an estimated construction cost of $750,000.00 or less, the Government may use the fixed price amounts provided in the Supplemental A/E Look-up Table provided during initial contract negotiations.  However, the Government reserves the right to award a contract based on negotiated overhead, profit, and hourly rates only as well as to use those rates for work orders which do not fall within the scope of the Look-up Table.  Consideration for this contract will be limited to those firms, joint ventures and their consultants who demonstrate the capability to perform all required services from their own existing active production office(s) located within the geographical borders of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality design and construction effort.  In addition, all firms and their consultants must: (1) have in-house CADD capabilities (compatible with the latest version of AutoCAD) and; (2) prepare all specifications for projects under this contract using the AIA Master spec.

The A/E Design firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility when the project involves architectural design. The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ (i.e. - the application and selection process).  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis from the University of Maryland Health Sciences and Human Services Library, Baltimore, MD, to procure offsite storage and collection access services for the History of Medicine Division's Archives and Modern Manuscripts program.  The purchase order term will be August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004 with options for three (3) successive one-year periods.  The University of Maryland-Baltimore Health Sciences and Human Services Library originated in 1813.  With an eye toward mastering the accelerated demands of the information future, the newly constructed Health Sciences and Human Services Library opened in 1998 in an unprecedented, multi-functional, comprehensive library/information services facility.  It also serves as the Regional Medical Library for the Southeastern/Atlantic Region, one example of its close administrative ties to the NLM.  The new Health Sciences and Human Services Library at the University of Maryland is one of the most sophisticated library/information technology centers in the country-it is also the largest medical library on the East Coast.  The 190,000-square-foot building serves the University's health and human services professional campus, a specialized training ground for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers, and nurses. A heavily computer-driven building, the new facility merges the traditional library with the Computer Science Department of the University.  Other components of the building include administrative offices, classrooms, computer laboratories, and demonstration rooms, as well as display and storage space for the University's collection of rare and historical medical books, and a large meeting and special events room.  The library offers secure underground storage space with archival quality compact shelving.  The space is climate controlled and access is limited to 3 full-time library staffers.  An environmental survey was conducted by NLM archives and modern manuscripts and preservation section staff and the facilities met or exceeded our specifications.  The library offers processing workspace within the storage area itself and a second fully equipped workstation within its general administrative office space.  The facility is managed by a full time library staffer who will be the main point of contact for the project officer.  Located within 50 miles of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus in downtown Baltimore, its close proximity will facilitate transporting materials from NLM, onsite access by the project officer, and communication with University of Maryland facilities management and senior administrative staff.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Optical Technology Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for Infrared Bandpass filters per the following Statement of Work and specifications: It is the goal of the LBIR Facility to procure IR filters with the following properties: 1)Filters need to function at 10 K. Filter band passes usually just scale with thermal contraction of the film thickness. This shift is usually small and not an issue. Substrate transmission can change very significantly. We (NIST) have cryogenic transmission measurement capability to assist in this portion of the project for proposed substrates; 2) All filters to be approximately 1 micron band pass (not a strict requirement); 3)The filter band edges should transition within 250 nm from 5 % transmission to 5 % less than average transmission along the central portion of the pass band; 4) Less than 0.1% out of band leakage for all other wavelengths, 2 - 30 microns. Would prefer 2 - 70 microns as could be achieved when substrate is 2 mm thick ZnSe. ZnSe blocks very well from 24 - 70 microns at 10 K. We have cryogenic transmission curves out to 100 microns for CaF2, KRS-5, MgF, ZnSe and ZnS that will be provided to bidders for filter development; 5) Transmission peak need not be flat. Variations in band pass of less that 10% are preferred, greater variations may be considered. Central transmission average may be as low as 60% if necessary; 6) Size: Total filter thickness must be 3 mm or thinner, and filter diameter must be approximately 1" in diameter but not greater; 7) Beam redirection by filter must be less than 1 microradian, therefore filter surfaces must be parallel to better than 1 arcmin; and 8) Filters should cover the spectral range of 5 to 15 microns in approximately 1 micron increments. (For example: a.6 - 7 microns; b. 7 - 8 microns; c. 8 - 9 microns; d. etc.). This would result in filters approximately centered on 5.5 microns, 6.5 microns, 7.5 microns, …13.5 microns, and 15.5 microns. 

We will possibly order 10 of each filter, or some other quantity depending on how many filters the offeror can make in a single batch production. Filter similarity is of high importance to the program. Though no stringent specification is available at this time, effort should be made such that filters within a given wavelength batch are as similar as can be reasonably made within a given fabrication deposition run. In an effort to reduce this large risk, filters at one or two wavelengths will be purchased from vendors that submit a satisfactory proposal for a filter at a satisfactory price. Vendors should submit proposals at filter wavelengths that represent medium to high risk in development. Once proof of capability has been established with the more difficult filters, the remaining filters will be purchased through a second procurement solicitation. The proposals for this initial solicitation are required to contain at a minimum the theoretically modeled spectra submitted in tab-delimited text format, the proposed substrate material and its thickness, the cost, and the delivery time. Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criterion: 1) The ability to meet the above properties (this will be judged based on the modeled spectra that is to be submitted in tab-delimited text format and the proposed substrate material and thickness); 2) Cost; and 3) Delivery time.

Multiple vendors may be chosen for the initial risk reduction phase of the procurement. However, being chosen for this initial phase of the total procurement is not an indication of selection for the final phase of the procurement where the remaining filters will be purchased. Selection of the vendor for the final phase of the procurement effort will be based on the performance of the delivered filters, the cost of the remaining filters, and the predicted delivery time. The final phase of the procurement will be initiated at a later date, therefore proposals for the complete set of filters will not be considered at this time.
Please mail proposals to: Sherri Miller, Purchasing Agent, NIST, 100 Bureau Drive, M/S 3571, Gaithersburg, MD  20899-3571 by the closing date of this notice. Proposals may also be submitted by facsimile to (301) 975-2541. Questions should be submitted to sherri.miller@nist.gov.

All proposals must be addressed to ATTN: Mr. Ed Starczewski, AFRL/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4114, and reference BAA-03-13-IFKA. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2004.  It is recommended that proposals be received by 1 August 2003 to maximize the possibility of award.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, including familiarity with fusion technologies and software testing issues. (2) Related Experience: the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technology and domain knowledge, (3) Extent to which existing capabilities and standards for software development and fusion testing are leveraged and (4) Cost reasonableness and realism.  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to proposals submitted under this BAA. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a proposal which shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The expected funding profile for this Master BAA is:  FY03:  $5,957; FY04: $860,997.  Total funding for this BAA is anticipated to be $867,954.   Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  The organization and personnel for this effort must have appropriate clearances at the time of contract award, and must have acceptable procedures for storing and handling classified information up to the TOP SECRET/SCI level.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is prohibited.    A copy of the Rome “BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry,” Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as “handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.” AFRL/IF utilizes contractors for technical assistance. These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. No informational briefings are planned, and questions must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer, Renee F. Arcuri.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 September 2004.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration intends to issue a purchase order to Vashaw Scientific Inc. for a Custom Tablet/Tablet profiling Syustem.  This is an anticipated sole source requirement.  The customized Integrated Microscopy System (IMS) will provide for image comparison of drug evidence dosage units including tablets and capsules.  The stereo-microscopic optical system must provide adequate depth of field and sufficiently high resolution to clearly document the monogram artwork and the important microscopic toolmark features on drug dosage units.  The imaging system must be able to acquire both low- and high-resolution images.  The low-resolution images will be used to identify gross physical attributes.  The high-resolution images will be used to capture microscopic toolmarks and striations.  The optical and image acquisition systems should be backwards compatible to existing Leica stereomicroscopes.  The associated customized computer software and hardware must provide for the easy and rapid acquisition of images at appropriate resolutions with suitable linked databases to store textual data and associated images.  The initial software must provide a searchable database to search by various characteristics (e.g., diameter, shape, scoring, side view, weight, etc.) to find all potential matches and show images of monograms, drugs present, manufacturer, trade name, and appearance data.  The initial software must provide a customizable report format to include 82x11 inch color prints of images.  This customized software must be Windows compatible, expandable, and upgradeable to accomplish the tasks. Future expandability will include comparison of images (subtraction and superimposition methods) and make a numerical evaluation of similarity between each pair of images.  The system must provide 82x11 inch color prints of annotated side-by-side image comparisons, and also must provide both 82x11 inch and very large (36-48 inch wide) color prints of annotated image side-by-side for display purposes.

The following items are the requirements for the new IMS:
HARDWARE:
X	The IMS must have a stereomicroscope with continuous visual zoom from 5X to 40X and a tilting binocular observation tube.
X	The IMS must have a stereomicroscope camera port with built in double iris diaphragm.

X	The IMS must have a computer workstation with at least a Pentium 4 or faster CPU, 2.8 GHz processor, 1.0GB SDRAM, 80 GB hard drive, 24X DVD-CDRM combo drive, 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, and a high-resolution 23-inch flat panel monitor.
X	The IMS must have a color digital camera with selectable 2560 x 1920, 1280 x 960, and 640 x 480 digital resolution and NRSC and S-video frame output.

SOFTWARE: A Microsoft Windows operating system that allows for:
X	Image comparison software.
X	Textual database.
X	Importation of existing databases.
X	Low and high resolution images.XC	Simple and complex search functions.
X	Output of high-resolution single and side-by-side digital images to normal size and large format Windows compatible printers.
X	Sufficient video frame rate to allow real-time focusing.
This requirement will be awarded in accordance with the policies and procedures as set forth in FAR Subpart 13-106-1(b).  No solicitation is available.  Closing date is 07/23/2003.

<DESC>ACC CONS/LGCA has a requirement for LMR replacement of Motorola wideband assets to a narrowband standard to meet the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) mandate.  ACC CONS/LGCA intends to purchase the equipment and maintenance from Motorola Incorporated, Hanover, Maryland, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). This is a sole-source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   The Motorola LMRs must be compatible with equipment currently in use at all ACC delivery locations stated in the attachment.  The frequencies of existing equipment may be compatible with other brands, but not for encryption, repeaters or reprogramming.  The technology used in the radios is proprietary to Motorola.  Award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling Air Force requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 8.404. This procurement is being awarded using a GSA Schedule. The equipment list/delivery locations  is posted under a separate attachment.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFP) for competitive quotes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing by mail, fax or email to Ms Lois Nicholson or  Ms Nora Ball not later than 12 NOON Eastern Standard Time on Thursday, March 27, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sri Kumar, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-741-7804, Email none
<DESC>The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) solicits innovative proposals for a new program on Real-World Reasoning.  A principal mission of IPTO, launched at DARPA in 2002, is to create the technologies critical to building practical cognitive information processing systems. Developing innovative machine reasoning technology that can effectively deal with the real world is central to this mission.

The objective of the REAL-WORLD REASONING (REAL) program is to explore and develop foundations, technology, and tools to enable effective, practical automated reasoning of the scale and complexity required for computers to perform complex tasks in the real world requiring intelligence.  Effective, “real-world” machine reasoning requires inference in environments that are far more complex in scale and scope than those tackled by current machine reasoning methods.  Enduring real-world systems need to deal with vast amounts of knowledge and information, often concerning dynamic and intentional phenomena. In addition, beliefs about the environment are often uncertain and involve plausible but not provable assumptions. The REAL program solicits innovative research efforts that can make fundamental and breakthrough advances in real-world reasoning to deal with these and related problems. Research efforts must implement the algorithms and technology in specific testbeds, and demonstrate novel capabilities for real-world reasoning.

Specifically, the program intends to:
 
1. Develop and demonstrate innovative techniques that push the envelope of performance of reasoning engines, in terms of the scale of the problems that can be dealt with, and the speed and correctness of reasoning.

2. Explore, develop, and demonstrate novel methods that extend the breadth of reasoning to deal with
a. Uncertain and dynamic environments where the knowledge base is characterized by uncertain and temporally changing information; and,b.Strategic environments characterized by goals and intentions of many interacting agents and actors, in both cooperative and non-cooperative contexts.

3.Build and demonstrate embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases that recognize the commonalities and similarities among multiple ontologies, and combine and merge them, so as to enable well-informed reasoning through the exploitation of all information in the knowledge base.

The program duration is anticipated to be five years. The research plan for this BAA is structured in three phases. The Phase I effort is planned for an 18-month period; Phase II, for 18 months thereafter; and Phase III, for the final 24 months of the program. For each phase, proposals should clearly identify and describe the project’s goals, approaches, milestones, testbeds, demonstrations, and cost. Proposers must structure their proposals to fit into one, two, or all of the three phases.

Proposers MUST obtain a copy of the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), and respond to ALL items in the PIP when preparing the proposal. A copy of the PIP may be obtained from:

http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html

Research is sought in the following three topics:

Topic 1: High-performance reasoning techniques 
Topic 2: Expanding the breadth of reasoning and hybrid methods
Topic 3: Embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases
 
Proposals may address one or more of the above topics, but must clearly identify the topics addressed and describe the proposed research for each separately.  In the following, the topics are described in detail.

Topic 1: High-performance reasoning techniques

We seek innovative research efforts that explore and develop methods that push the envelope of performance of reasoning engines. Metrics to measure performance should be clearly specified in the proposal, including the scale of the underlying knowledge bases for the reasoning environment (such as number of entities, variables, rules, etc.), the speed of answering queries (fo

It is desired that the Phase I research emphasize new high-performance inference methods for propositional knowledge bases. It is suggested that later phases build on the successes of core research in Phase I, and this includes extending the research to further performance improvements in propositional knowledge bases, as well as to high-performance reasoning in other systems such as first-order and higher-order logic, or fragments of such systems.

Proposals should clearly specify the performance targets, outline the technical approaches, and clearly present arguments and evidence to establish how the proposed approaches have the potential of reaching the specified target performance. 

Methods for high performance may be based on any technical approach, but generic applicability to any knowledge base is important, and in particular for any propositional system in Phase I. Of particular interest are approaches based on models of computational complexity that characterize the computational hardness profile, or regimes of different complexities, of a given reasoning situation. Such an approach may exploit the hardness profile of a problem, and the knowledge base structure, to design new reasoning architectures and computationally tractable inference methods to deal with intrinsically high-complexity regimes, via systematic and well-characterized approximations or modifications of the reasoning environment, while minimally compromising other desirable dimensions of performance. Generic learning methods that enable scaling and speed-up of inference in any context are also of interest, as are methods that exploit combinations and interactions of different knowledge representations, and parallel reasoning, to obtain performance gains.   

Proposals should quantify the performance targets for reasoning methods, in each phase. For example, a target for Phase I may be the ability to perform reasoning in propositional knowledge bases in excess of 10K variables and 40K rules, with 85 percent or higher rate of questions answered correctly, and a query response time of  seconds on a 2.5-GHz processor.  In Phases II and III, proposals may address methods for further performance scaling of propositional reasoning (for example, Phase II might address methods for improving query response time in a knowledge base ten times the size of knowledge bases considered in Phase I, with a Phase III scaling target of an additional ten times or more), and improved rate of correct answers (for example, in excess of 90%). Extensions to other knowledge bases such as first-order logic and fragments of such systems are also of interest in later phases. While this example is suggestive of the specification of performance targets, bidders are encouraged to propose all key relevant performance targets and methods that push the performance envelope maximally. 

Proposed new reasoning methods should be demonstrated in a testbed. While performers may adopt their own testbed for developing their ideas for generic high-performance reasoning (which should be described in the proposal), DARPA is interested in testing and evaluating the reasoning methods to be developed in each phase of this topic in a common testbed. Performers will be required to demonstrate their new methods in such a common testbed, which will be made available to the performers. Such a common testbed may be drawn, for example, from the domain of chess, where the reasoning challenge problems may involve answering queries such as whether or not there exists a checkmate in a specified number of moves, starting from a mid-game position with a specified number and types of pieces for each player, within a specified response time window (for example, five seconds on a 2.5-GHz processor), and with associated explanations. Proposers are strongly encouraged to translate their proposed milestones to specific capabilities to be accomplished in the above mid-game chess problem (for example, Phase I target may translate as follows: finding the existence of a checkmate in ten moves with five pieces for each player placed in arbitrary positions on the board). While this common testbed may be drawn from the domain of chess, it should be noted that the program emphasizes generic reasoning methods and not techniques specific to the testbed domain.

Topic 2: Expanding the breadth of reasoning and hybrid methods.

The goal of research in this topic is to develop foundations and methods that significantly expand the breadth of reasoning critical to practical cognitive information processing systems. This includes developing efficient techniques for reasoning in uncertain, dynamic, and intentional environments, as well as hybrid reasoning methods. Strategic reasoning methods and tools that support reasoning in multi-player contexts are also of interest. 

This topic comprises three sub-topics:

Reasoning in uncertain and dynamic environments: Research is sought in the development of efficient and scalable methods for temporal reasoning under uncertainty for large knowledge bases. Of interest are methods for effectively representing uncertain information and relations among temporally evolving entities, as well as algorithms that support rich query-processing and predictive reasoning. Methods for assessing the states of unobserved entities in partially observed systems are of interest. Fast inference methods that can scale to large knowledge bases are important. Proposals should specify the target knowledge base size, and target query response time (say, on a 1-GHz processor). Approaches may include dynamic Bayesian networks that exploit the inference problem structure, and the use of systematic approximations. Non-monotonic reasoning methods that can effectively deal with dynamic changes to identities of items in the knowledge base, and deontic reasoning to deal with changes to the rules are also of interest. Proposals should clearly identify the metrics and milestones, and describe the testbed and demonstrations for program phases, and how the proposed approaches can potentially meet the milestones. For example, a Phase I target may be to develop and demonstrate the foundations and methods for temporal reasoning under uncertainty in a knowledge base of a certain size (e.g., 10K state variables), target response time on a specified processor (e.g., order of seconds on a 1-GHz processor), and error in state estimation (e.g., less than 10 per cent). Further scaling (e.g., 10X, 100X knowledge base size) and improvements in metrics may be addressed in additional phases. Proposals that address non-monotonic and deontic reasoning should specify the metrics and milestones, capturing the underlying implementation tradeoffs. 

Hybrid reasoning: The goal in this topic is to develop innovative methods for hybrid reasoning that effectively combine multiple methods of reasoning to exploit advantages provided by different approaches. Example approaches include deductive inference, probabilistic reasoning, temporal reasoning, reasoning by analogy, etc. Methods that combine mental models with logic reasoners to exploit potential advantages of human-like reasoning, as well as methods for combining multiple theories, are also of interest. Hybrid reasoners that act on different partitions of the knowledge base (for example, partitioning by domain, time, and space), and methods for efficient dynamic composition of reasoners, are also solicited. Also of interest are hybrid methods that combine probabilistic and relational reasoning.  Proposals must clearly identify approaches to addressing the technical challenges, and describe the metrics, milestones, and testbed for demonstrations, in each phase.  An example milestone may be to develop and demonstrate, in Phase I, a hybrid reasoning system with specified types of interacting reasoners in a knowledge base of certain size (e.g., 100K variables), with order of seconds query response time on a 1-GHz processor, and demonstrate performance benefits and new functionality not possible otherwise. It is suggested that research in Phases II and III address combining methods that are successfully developed in Phase I. 


Strategic Reasoning: The goal of this topic is to develop methods for reasoning in strategic multi-player or multi-agent contexts where agents may be cooperative or non-cooperative. This includes tools for strategic reasoning that a) enhance reasoning ability to support intelligent individual decision-making in multi-player contexts, and b) that support composition of multi-player games to enable simulation-based analysis and reasoning. Interdisciplinary research that exploits and extends game theory for reasoning in dynamic strategic interactions involving many players in a hierarchy is of interest. Interactions may range from coalition-formation to bargaining to bidding and auction games. Strategic reasoning methods, applicable to a broad spectrum of strategic contexts, must address techniques to represent game models compactly, to ascertain best responses, and to predict game outcomes and dynamics. Developing tools for composing dynamic hierarchical games, including the development of a language for the specification and composition of games, is of interest. Proposals must be structured to address novel basic and core research in Phase I, with substantial extensions undertaken in later phases. Proposals should clearly specify the metrics and milestones for each phase. It is desired that in Phase I, proposals emphasize development of methods for compact representation of games, efficient algorithms for computing stable and predictable outcomes in games with large state spaces (target processing time and state space should be specified), and a framework and testbed for composing games for simulation and analysis. The emphases in Phases II and III will be on scaling strategic reasoning tools to game contexts of several hundred agents; incorporating probabilistic, temporal, and hybrid reasoners into individual or agent decision processes; developing rapid game composition capability and distributed play; and demonstrating the value of strategic reasoning in DOD contexts such as logistics and war-gaming.
 
Topic 3: Embedded reasoners for active knowledge bases

Research is sought in innovative methods for reasoners that can be embedded in knowledge bases with multiple ontologies to support efficient and well-informed reasoning. Functionally, embedded reasoners should enable the maximal exploitation of information present in the knowledge base for efficient query response. Of interest are methods that reason across multiple large ontologies, and dynamically recognize similarities, overlap, and divergence in the relations and structure of the different ontologies. Methods that rapidly and effectively join, combine, and merge large ontologies are of interest. The technical approaches to developing embedded reasoners should be clearly explained, and these may include, but are not limited to, graph matching and isomorphism algorithms.  Proposals should clearly specify the metrics and milestones, and testbed and demonstration plans, for each phase, capturing key dimensions of performance such as time to combine and merge ontologies of given sizes at a given processing speed. For example, a Phase I milestone may be to combine and merge two arbitrary ontologies, each having tens of thousands of entries, within seconds on a 1-GHz processor; and Phases II and III may focus on further scaling, as well combining ontologies with temporal, probabilistic, and other types of information. 

PROGRAM SCOPE  
  
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype software and/or hardware demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. In Phase II, DARPA may specify one or more common testbeds for the whole program, and performers are required to integrate and demonstrate their technology in such testbeds. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors. Proposals may involve multiple research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.    

GENERAL INFORMATION
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA/IPTO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Proposal, by accessing the URL below:

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=03-34

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the 
"original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Proposal.  If a proposer intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IPTO Technical – Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  

Proposers must submit an original and 2 paper copies of the full proposal, and 6 electronic copies in Microsoft Word ’97 for IBM-compatible or PDF format.  Each electronic copy must be on a separate disk or CD.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-34, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and “Copy ___ of 6.”  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by the initial closing deadline of 12:00 NOON (ET)  September 4, 2003, to be considered for the initial evaluation phase. However, BAA 03-34, REAL, will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) July 6, 2004. While the proposals submitted after September 4, 2003 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those submitted by the initial closing date. 

DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-34 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-34 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance (detailed descriptions of the criteria are contained in the PIP):

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit.
(2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem.
(3)	Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA.
(5)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition.  
(6)	Cost Realism.  

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on submitting a proposal to this BAA, must be received at one of the administrative addresses below by 12:00 NOON (ET) June 29, 2004; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for some of the correspondence regarding BAA 03-34.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  All proposals, administrative correspondence, and questions submitted must be in the English language.  Submissions received in other than English shall be rejected.

Phase III (Option) -- Development of re-engineered course materials, teaching of the re-engineered course(s), and demonstration that the re-engineering process provides the expected results.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Air Force, Air Command (ACC), Langley AFB, Va., is tasked with the requirement to provide radars for use at eleven (11) Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) sites.  Currently, we operate a DPS-5 radar at the Cudjoe Key, FL site, and TPS-63 radars at six (6) sites, and a L88-A at the remaining four (4) sites.

POTENTIAL NEED:  The purpose of this announcement is to identify and locate sources fully capable of providing radars for an upcoming requirement.  The proposed system must operate within the 275K and 420K aerostat parameter and not alter airborne characteristics.  The system, to include radar and antenna, cannot exceed 1,300 pounds in weight.  The system must interface with airborne support equipment currently fielded in the (TARS) network.  The radar system must be capable of detecting a 2m2 Swerling Type I target with a noise-limited single scan Pd (Probability of Detection) of not less than 75% within the surveillance volume.  The surveillance volume is defined as 10-150 NM, 360 degrees in azimuth, from ground level to 2000 feet above the aerostat's flight altitude.  This performance shall apply with the system operating normally and all system losses accounted for including moving target indication (MTI), constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and atmospheric losses due to absorption and lens-effect.  We invite all qualified sources to respond to this notice in support of the ACC mission.  The latest TARS Radar Statement of Objectives (SOO) is currently posted on the Electronic Posting System (EPS), and we invite all interested contractors to take a look at it.  If you are interested and can provide the requirement stated, please respond to the following points of contact.

Description
 
Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to recompete its Contracted Advisory and Assistance Services (CAAS) contract to meet its continuing requirement for contracted support on a worldwide basis within the broad range of advisory and assistance services.  The government is combining the ACC TEOMS (F44650-00-R-0001) and the ACC CAAS (F44650-01-R-0001) acquisitions into one procurement.  The RFP solicitation number (F44650-01-R-0001) remains the same, however the title of the acquisition is changed to CAAS II.  This covers three major categories of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS):  Management and Professional Support services; Studies, Analyses, and Evaluations; and Engineering and Technical.  All HQ ACC directorates are considered primary using activities for this contract effort; however, other organizations and agencies assigned to directly support HQ ACC may require similar CAAS services on an as needed basis.  CAAS II will be used to complement the Government_s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  Information concerning the current contract can be found at http://www2.acc.af.mil/lg/Cons/Lgcu/CAAS/CAASHome.html.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring the EPS web pages for further information concerning this source selection, including the release of the solicitations and all subsequent amendments and correspondence related to the solicitation.  Offerors must download the RFP from the web page; no hard copies will be mailed. 
 
Initial notifications outlined this acquisition to be commercial in nature. After further 
 review of this strategy, this acquisition will be converted to non-commercial.  This change in strategy is being driven by the government_s inability to include any type of cost-reimbursement CLIN in a commercial acquisition.  We would like to apologize to all interested offerors for the delay in the release of the CAAS II RFP.  Release of the RFP in the non-commercial format is scheduled for on or about 15 February 2001.

This Request for Information (RFI) requests technical information on the capabilities of memory units within industry and on future developmental efforts.  The information obtained will be used to determine the availability of a memory unit (MU) with the potential to meet the stated objectives for use in the aircraft specified above to support the possibility of a full and open competition.   The desired objectives of the MU are to: 1) execute aircraft specific user-developed programs directly from a Type II PCMCIA card, loaded from a Type II PCMCIA Card into the MU, or residing as a software module in the MU;  2) interface over a HSI bus to a digital map computer through both copper wire and fibre optics;  3) have a minimum of 2 PCMCIA card slots, one dedicated to maintenance data download from MIL-STD 1553 MUX bus and theatre map upload to map computer and the other slot for mission data communication; 4) load/record classified information from/to the mission card utilizing an independent volatile memory buffer inside the MU; 5) perform secure erase of mission memory and mission card in accordance with TAMMAC Security Requirements Document/Traceability Matrix and at a rate not less than 100 Mbytes/second; 6) satisfy existing program form, fit, function, and interface (F3I) integration and commonality requirements; 7) become a bus controller performing aircraft system OFP loads emulating the Mission Loader Verifier Set (MLVS);  8) utilize both COTS and Rugedized PCMCIA cards; 9) be compliant with MIL-STD-461E for EMI/EMC; 10) be compliant with all versions of Windows 2000, ME, XP, 98 and 95 operating systems  allowing the unit to read/write data from/to a card formatted on all Navy ground mission planning or maintenance workstations having either internal or external PCMCIA card reader/writers. The MU will be supported by an Organizational to Commercial Depot maintenance philosophy with the potential of establishing an organic depot using a teaming arrangement. Current Navy planning necessitates memory units be available for procurement in FY05 to FY09 and beyond with installation beginning in FY06. An estimated 1200 units will be procured for the remainder of this program.  The response should include, but not be limited to, the following:  a) A one page company history description to include:  Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, primary customer base, and points of contacts and their telephone numbers, that are able to discuss the material submitted; b) product descriptions.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Stille-Sonesta, Inc. Dallas, TX for the purchase of a imagiQ(tm) Surgical Imaging Table for the VAMC, West Side, Chicago IL. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 339112. Requirements include the following:  highest table height of 45" and a lowest table height of 28", Lateral roll of  15 degrees (combined lateral tilt and pan handle), patient load capacity of 440 lbs. and an overall weight of 605 lbs. Imageable area shall have a length of 72"/61" and width of 21"/17" (both with/without head section).  The equipment shall have a longitudinal travel of 28", lateral travel of 10", and Trendelenburg travel  25 degrees.  VAMC requires a lateral tilt and tabletop float that functions concurrently reducing C-arm maneuverability and a table, which provides fluoroscopic views of the entire torso and below the knees without moving the C-arm. To the best of our knowledge, only the imagiQ(tm) has a 4-way tabletop float capability with adjustable heights and the capabilities indicated.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements or has the functionality of the above equipment, may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within (ten) 10 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, is  currently seeking interested sources for Characterization, Processing  Optimization, Testing, and Life Cycle Support of Energetic Materials,  Environment, Information Assurance and Micro-chemical Reactors in support of  Armament Systems Processing Division of the Warheads, Energetics and Combat  support Armaments Center - WECAC.  The Government intends to award a contract  to Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT), Hoboken, NJ on a sole source basis.   As the U.S. Army begins its task of transformation, advanced materials and  manufacturing processes have become increasingly important to the Army’s  objective of meeting transportability, maneuverability and survivability  requirements.  In addition, there is a need to rapidly deliver advanced weapons  and munitions technology directly to the field in order to support contingency  force requirements.  TACOM-ARDEC requires highly specialized analytical and  engineering support for the development and production of energetic materials  and compositions, especially using continuous processing mediums; and for the  development, demonstration and transition of innovative technology solutions  including the communications (command and control/information assurance),  environmental challenges associated with the life-cycle management of weapons  and munitions and development or new power sources.  The US Army has been  engaged in the development of advanced energetic materials and compositions for  use in a wide range of applications.  In order to ease the transition step from  laboratory to production, a complete understanding of the process and the  product are required, the “black art” associated with energetics manufacturing  must be removed.  New methods of manufacturing energetic materials applying  state-of-the-art technology, has required new methods in communication  techniques for remote data acquisition, control and observation, be developed  for the characterization and testing of these materials.  On-line and off-line  rheological behavior of simulant and explosive formulations, quantitatively  determine the degree of mixedness of highly filled suspensions, mathematical  modeling of the twin screw mixer/extruder that uses Finite Element method and  characterization of raw materials to determine extreme conditions that may be  produced in the mixer/extruder need to be conducted in order to develop the  fundamental understanding of the energetic process.  These methodologies and  technologies are proprietary to Stevens Institute of Technology.  Parametric  models shall be developed to simulate the manufacturing process and performance  of components applying selected advanced materials including amorphous metals.   These models shall be integrated with existing enterprise software tools such  as Windchill and Pro/ENGINEER for collaboration capabilities.  Population of  the database of the ACES knowledge-based software system, which is a Steven  Institute of Technology patented software, will be required with the design  properties including analytical material and manufacturing models of selected  emerging advanced materials for immediate use by design engineers.   Performance, manufacturing and cost analyses shall be performed for a select  number of munitions components determined jointly by the contractor and TACOM- ARDEC using finite element methods, dynamic simulation tools, knowledge-based  engineering systems, and other related software tools.  The performance,  vulnerability and processability of explosives depend on the morphology (shape,  size, and surface properties) and defect structure (dislocations, stacking  faults, mosaic structure and polygonization) of the crystalline ingredients.   The crystal morphology and defect structure are developed predominantly during  crystal growth/dissolution stages and obtained through modifications during  processing as a function of the applied thermo-mechanical conditions.  The  control of crystal morphology and defect structure at the minimum requires the  application of well-controlled crystal growth/dissolution studies in synergy  with highly sensitive characterization methods to establish the link between  the crystal growth conditions and the crystal morphology and defect structure.  Mathematical modeling of the energetic materials crystal growth, size and  shape, and purity must be conducted off-line and on-line to control the  crystallization process.  Future armament and munitions borne by the future  U.S. soldier will be highly integrated systems involving advanced sensing,  imaging, data analysis, communications, and weaponry capabilities.  In order to  sustain the energy requirements of these systems, high-density light weight  power sources will be required which surpass the projected capacities of new  battery technologies.  As a result, the transformation of chemical fuels into  electrical energy will be implemented in lightweight and compact mobile  systems.  Devices like miniature fuel cells offer promise for this conversion  in a highly efficient way, such that the energy requirements for the soldier  platform may be met while achieving the goals of light weight and low volume.   All these goals appear achievable in the light of the advances in Micro-Electro  Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology.  Despite much progress in this area,  there is a considerable lack in understanding the role of the surface in  heterogeneous catalytic reactions in miniature chemical conversion devices  (“microreactors”). Surface phenomena are the principal driving forces in many  chemical energy conversion devices including fuel cells, desulfurizers, steam  reformers, water-gas shift reactors, and preferential oxidation reactors which  are all critical components in the conversion of hydrocarbon fuel sources into  electrical power.  This is particularly true in the development of a fuel cell  in the power range of 1 to 20 W equipped with a fuel processor which converts  the military’s logistic fuels into H2 with <10 ppm CO.  However, the  development of such a miniature fuel processor, requiring integration of  catalytic microreactor components, is currently a bottleneck problem that needs  to be solved for durable and affordable use of fuel cell-based micropower  systems.  This Market Survey should not be construed as a request for proposal  or as a commitment on the part of the Government to issue a solicitation.   Information and samples shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the  Government.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the  results of this survey.

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis is for the cost comparison study of select functional areas of the ACC Communications Group as announced by Chief of Staff of the Air Force August 3, 1999.  This study is  projected to be completed by summer of the year 2000.  Request feedback on the draft documents that are to be posted on the EPS (Electronic Posting System) website (http://ww.eps.gov) on or about 5 Jan 00.  It is the Government's intent to release the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) by July 2000.  At this time we will create an official Source List.   Interested offerors are requested to add their names to the Source List by e-mailing the contract administrator, Ronda Ford, at  ronda.ford@langley.af.mil or faxing a request to her attention at 757-764-9773.  Offerors should reference the solicitation number (F44650-00-R0007) and include a complete mailing address, phone/fax numbers, and email address and indicate whether their firm is a small business, small disadvantaged business, or a woman-owned business.  All responsible sources may submit an offer to be considered.

This cost comparison will be conducted in accordance with the Air Force Commercial Activities Policy Instruction that implements the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This circular reaffirms the Government's policy to rely on the private sector for products and services.  When  in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer.

The specific ACC Communications Group functions under study include select areas of the 82 CSS (Computer Systems Squadron) and  the 83 CS (Communications Squadron) at Langely AFB, VA and the 84 RADES (Radar Evaluation Squadron) at Hill AFB, UT.  This A-76 study impacts a total of 208 DoD positions 19 officers, 143 enlisted, and 46 civilians.  ACC CONS and the ACC Com Group anticipate hosting a formal site visit shortly after the release of the final RFP.  The formal site visit will include a pre-proposal conference.  The above website will provide specific details.

Please forward your comments to ACC Contracting Squadron/LGCT, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 402, Langley AFB, VA23665-2791.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC), is tasked with the operations, maintenance, and support of the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS).  The primary mission of TARS is to support the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) in counter-narcotics and drug surveillance missions in support of U.S. national security objectives.  The program consists of 10 sites along the southern border of the US and 1 site in Puerto Rico.

POTENTIAL NEED:  The purpose of this announcement is to identify sources capable of providing Class IV 420K aerostats.  The Air Force's initial procurement of one (1) 420K aerostat, with the option for three (3) more, will be procured as a subcontract under the TARS OM&S prime contract.  In addition, the Air Force intends to procure up to 10 additional units in which ACC CONS will be the procurement office.  The sources sought and resulting market research information will be used to support both procurement efforts.  As such, potential offerors should identify in the data submitted to the Air Force any proprietary information that should not be released to the TARS OM&S contractor.

ACC is accomplishing market research in an attempt to promote full and open competition to the maximum extent practicable and to define our requirements in terms that will enable and encourage offerors to supply commercial items/services, if possible.  We invite all sources to participate in our market research in support of meeting the ACC mission.  Potential offerors are given an opportunity to comment on this requirement. .  Due to the limited number of design packages and the high cost of reproduction, only those potential offerors that can reasonably expect to meet our requirement should request a copy.  

If you have interest in this requirement, you are requested to submit a summary of your capabilities, your opinion on the commerciality of this requirement, and identify if you would desire to meet with ACC representatives to obtain further details.  The Government anticipates an industry conference o/a 14/15 July 1999.  Please advise of your availability to participate.  Again, identify in your correspondence if items should be protected from release outside the government due to proprietary and/or competitive restrictions.  Summaries should be received at ACC CONS no later than 12 July 1999 and can be submitted by any of the following means:

<DESC>The Air Combat Command (ACC) Contracting Squadron at Langley AFB, VA seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority".  The Air Force is seeking interest and information specifically for the potential privatization of the electric, natural gas, water and wastewater utility systems at numerous Air Combat Command bases.
The objective, should privatization result, is the ownership of the Air Force base's electric, natural gas, water and wastewater systems, operation and maintenance and obligation to continue to provide utility service for an indefinite and ongoing period will transfer to a utility service provider.  All responsibility for providing and maintaining reliable utility service, including such items as, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead costs will become the utility service provider's responsibility.  It is intended that the privatization will ultimately reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services.
This request for interested parties is for gathering information and is a required component of a systematic process to evaluate the interested parties under the Air Force Utilities Privatization Program.  To minimize costs to both potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with formal RFPs.  This Request for Interest is not a guarantee on the part of the government that a formal solicitation will be issued.

DAVIS-MONTHAN
UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS
General: Davis-Monthan AFB is located in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona (AZ), in Pima County, within the city limits of Tucson. The 355th Wing is the host wing at DMAFB. Davis-Monthan AFB occupies 10,633 acres and contains approximately 1850 buildings.  Natural gas is the only system being considered for privatization at Davis-Monthan AFB.
Natural Gas: Natural Gas is supplied to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base by Southwest Gas Corporation through a 4 inch main line and 4 inch meter (Wilmot City Gate) and a 6 inch main line and a 4 inch meter (Swan Gate). These metering and regulating stations serve the base at 35 PSIG. Southwest Gas Corporation owns the two supply lines, metering stations and regulators. The natural gas system is owned by the base from the metering stations onward. These two separate supply systems are linked at the FamCamp area. The main metering station is located just south of the North Ramp near Building 1632. At this station, the lines supplying the housing areas are split from those supplying the main base. All lines are looped except those supplying the Kachina Housing Area. Southwest Gas Corporation also supplies and owns a 4 oz natural gas service to Bldg. 8030 with a separate 1.5 inch main and 1.5 inch meter.
There is an El Paso Natural Gas Company 10 ¾ inch High Pressure Natural Gas pipeline that crosses a southwest portion of the Base. This line is not connected to the Base natural gas system.
There are no physical on-base natural gas wells. The Southwest Gas Corporation metering stations used for billing purposes is identified in Table 7.1.1-1. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 366,555 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 10 years old. The old gas system replaced is carbon steel pipe and is abandoned in place.
Natural gas is used primarily for central gas chiller plant, space heating, hot water, and exclusively for stove, range, hot water and majority heating in all housing. There are service regulators for every building including all housing that reduces the pressure of the gas. Approximately 99 percent of the system piping is polyethylene (PE) and the remaining 1 percent is PVC or carbon steel. The PE piping was installed in the early 1990’s. No cathodic protection systems exist for the natural gas system. The existing 2 inch PVC line with steel risers remains in the trailer park area and is projected to be abandoned in the future. PVC pipe for gas is not industry standard and due to yard irrigation, it is probable that deterioration of the steel risers is likely. Since the steel is not interconnected adding cathodic protection could be costly. Abandonment of the system entirely or a renovation project to upgrade the system to industry standards should be considered for the trailer park area. The PE piping diameter ranges from 8 inches to 1 inch. A total of 40 meters are located within the base gas system.

A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Department Of Defense (DOD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high altitude airship (HAA) based laser relay mirror (RM) demonstration in the MDA Pacific Test Range.  The envisioned mission is to relay a ground (MAUI) based illuminator beam through a relay mirror on the MDA HAA ACTD airship to actively track space or mid-course objects, perhaps objects that are part of the Integrated Flight Test (IFT) series. The demonstration will provide risk reduction for a variety of laser relay and HAA missions.  The active track mission directly demonstrates the ability of an RM to enhance active tracking of mid-course or space objects.  In addition, the demonstration, although envisioned at low power (500W), obviously demonstrates the ability to relay a high power beam for various high energy laser (HEL) kill missions.  Information on the MDA HAA ACTD can be found at http://www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo/barbb/haaactd.htm. The approximate program budget is $30M over 3 + years.  

There are at least two approaches to achieve the above objectives: 

I.	Approach I would augment an existing Air Force program known as the Aerospace Relay Mirror System (ARMS) to achieve the objectives.  ARMS is a relay mirror demonstrator with two 75 cm apertures currently being developed by Boeing/SVS in Albuquerque for approximately $20M. Under this scenario, the ARMS test bed would be provided GFE to the winner of a BAA competition.  The competition would be for all or the appropriate parts of the upgrade of ARMS, currently a low altitude dual line of site demonstrator, to fly at high altitude (65,000 ft) and perform the active track mission.  The upgrade would probably include lightweight telescopes, a sidecar LWIR acquisition system and an upgraded IRU. Integration of all components and testing at low altitude would be carried out. Next, the enhanced ARMS would be integrated with the MDA HAA ACTD and tested in the Pacific test range with a GFE illuminator laser (current laser is the 500W HiBrite laser).

II.	Approach II would build a stand-alone new platform to achieve the program objectives. For this approach, the design information obtained in the current ARMS program would be made available, but a totally new platform would be built for the MDA mission.  This approach would have the benefit of providing a separate platform and leaving the ARMS testbed available for other investigations.  A key question is can this be done within the envisioned schedule and a budget of $30M. 

This request for information seeks industry input on the above or alternate approaches to this initiative.  Preliminary information on ARMS and a suggestive list of questions are given below.  MDA HAA ACTD information can be found at http://www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo/barbb/haaactd.htm. 

B. ARMS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

The objective of the ARMS program is to design, fabricate and integrate a subscale (.75m) relay mirror system, demonstrating utility and characterizing performance in laboratory and field experiments.  The ARMS statement of objectives is defined below.

1.	Demonstrate dual line-of-sight (DLOS) acquisition, tracking and pointing with mrad precision against augmented and un-augmented space objects. 
2.	Demonstrate and characterize relay optical capture of an illuminator and/or surrogate HEL beam with source-to-relay cooperative tracking and alignment.
3.	Develop mode logic and fire control processes that demonstrate autonomous control of relay functionality and mission timeline.
4.	Deliver a relay mirror test bed that can accommodate growth enhancements for advanced experiments in adaptive optics, HEL operation, discrimination and surveillance.
5.	The delivered testbed should be compatible with and accommodate an upgrade to fly on a High Altitude Airship (HAA) with minimal component obsolescence. 

While ARMS, as currently constituted and funded, is for a low altitude demonstration (possibly on a crane) of the above objectives, it has been designed with operation on a High Altitude Airship (HAA) as an ultimate goal.  For instance, with the addition of lightweight telescopes, ARMS should be able to meet the 4000 lb weight goal. With the telescope upgrade and with the addition of high altitude processors ARMS should meet the following performance requirements listed in the table below. 

ARMS completed a PDR in May 2003 and is scheduled for a CDR in October 2003.  Lab testing will be complete in February 2005 with field-testing complete in June 2005.  Therefore, if method I is chosen by the government, it is expected that parallel development of the high altitude package will take place in 2004 and integration of the high altitude components with ARMS would take place after the planned field tests in 2005.  This would allow high altitude component integration and test to be completed in time to integrate the package on the MDA HAA in the latter half of 2006 




 
Table 1: ARMS Performance Requirements (High Altitude System)

The ARMS Technical Requirements Document as well as other information can be made available upon request and upon approval by the government.  


C. SUGGESTED QUESTIONS

Following are some specific questions and/or response guidelines for this request.  Contractors should freely make any other comments or suggestions on areas not discussed here.

1)	From both technical and programmatic viewpoints, does the contractor believe that one or both of the methodologies discussed above would provide a viable path to completion of the program objectives within the cost and schedule constraints specified. If not, please provide recommendations on how the program specification could be improved.
2)	Are there any technical specifications that should be in the draft text that are not currently included?
3)	Is there anything in the current draft text that the contractor feels is unnecessary (technically or programmatically) or that is not clearly stated?
5)	Is the proposed funding profile adequate to successfully complete the one or both of the approaches as outlined?  If not, please elaborate.
6)	What is a reasonable page limitation for a technical proposal volume (1 inch margins, 12 point proportional Times New Roman font for body of text, 10 point proportional font for figures and tables), including all pages from title sheet through appendices?
7)	In addition to responding to any of the above questions, the contractor may also offer any other comments or recommendations that it feels would improve a BAA and the proposed technical effort.

<SUBJECT>Expression of Interest
<DESC>Request for Expression of Interest One-on-One Meetings with Interested Parties Management and Operation of Idaho National Laboratory  RFP No. DE-RP07-03ID14517 Introduction.   The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking input from parties interested in competing for work at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Specifically, DOE seeks information from potential offerors to be used in formulating a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for management and operating services under a performance- based management contract at the INL. DOE intends to issue a full and open competition RFP for award of a performance based management contract (PBMC).  DOE seeks input on how the Department can best maximize competition and establish a contract that empowers the contractor to operate a vibrant, world class, safe, and cost-effective national laboratory.  DOE also intends to issue a draft RFP for comments from interested parties at a later date. DOE Objectives for the INL.  The INL will be a multi-program DOE laboratory managed by DOE?s Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE). The INL will be a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 35 and a DOE management and operating contract site.  Contract activities will not include clean-up and waste remediation activities currently being funded through DOE?s Office of Environmental Management (EM). DOE has announced plans to return the INL to its historic primary mission of nuclear technology development in order to support the Nation's expanding nuclear energy initiatives.  These plans place Idaho at the center of DOE efforts to develop advanced nuclear technologies and systems.  The INL will also conduct activities in support of national defense and national security programs and other primary DOE missions. The detailed scope of work for the contract is under development.  DOE anticipates the scope of work will include:    -- Assembling the capabilities to deliver the research and advance the design for a prototype Generation IV nuclear energy system,    -- Establishing a strong science and technology leadership team that will partner with the Department to pursue its nuclear technology and security vision for the laboratory,    -- Integrating Idaho's current nuclear energy capabilities under a single, future-focused, management structure. The contract will also include management of the INL?s research and development programs, operation of its existing nuclear facilities and general infrastructure, and services and support to other activities and contractors at the INL. Request for Expression of Interest.  Parties interested in competing for the work are invited to submit an Expression of Interest that exceeds no more than seven (7) pages when printed.  The Expression of Interest should include the following: (1.) Name and address of the interested party; (2.) Point of Contact (name, telephone number and e-mail address); (3.) Summary answers to the discussion questions listed below.  The discussion questions will be the basis for the information exchange between DOE and interested parties during the one-on-one meetings. The discussion questions that are to be addressed in the Expression of Interest and will be the focus of one-on-one meetings are as follows: 1. What, in your opinion, should be DOE?s vision for the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) over the next 10 years? 2.What would be your approach to making the INL a world-class, multi program laboratory? 3.  What resources must be represented in a proposal team to accomplish 1 and 2 above? 4. What specific suggestions do you have regarding performance measures, assignment of risk and incentivizing performance? 5. What barriers currently exist (e.g., DOE imposed or otherwise) that would hinder you from attaining your vision? 6.What suggestions do you have regarding how the contract could be structured to leverage funding from non-DOE sources to help accomplish the INL?s vision? 7.How can we best ensure meaningful participation from small business? 8.How can we best ensure meaningful participation from academic institutions? 9.What would be your general approach to transitioning the work from the current contractor? 10.How can we improve your knowledge to provide meaningful proposals? 11.What are the important discriminating factors that we should consider in making this         selection? 12. How should we best structure the RFP to promote creative approaches, use of outside resources to enhance the INL, and new partnerships? 13. What other suggestions do you have? Submission Date.  Expressions of Interest must be received by email not later than 4:00 PM Mountain Time, on July18, 2003.  Any business confidential or proprietary information contained in an Expression of Interest must be so designated and will be kept confidential to fullest extend permitted by law. Note:  Interested parties may submit a written response to this announcement only and are not required to participate in the One-on-One Meetings.  Any response, or decision not to respond to this announcement does not commit or restrict interested parties in any way regarding their future participation in this process. Submission Address.

Future information about this or other potential solicitations will be posted on the DOE Business Opportunities Page (http://e-center.doe.gov), FedBizOpps (http://fedbizopps.gov) and RFP Homepage at (http://www.INL-RFP.gov). One-on-One Meeting Guidelines.  Pursuant to FAR 15.201, the goal of one-on-one meetings is to improve the understanding of DOE?s requirements and the capabilities of prospective competitors.  DOE will conduct one-on-one meetings with interested parties that have provided an Expression of Interest described above.  DOE anticipates these one-on-one meetings will take place between July 30, 2003 and August 1, 2003, at Loews L?Enfant Plaza Hotel, 480 L?Enfant Plaza, SW, Washington DC.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13. ***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  All interested offerors may submit a quote. ***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for a Personnel Whole-Body Portal Contamination Monitor. ***

All interested parties are invited to submit a quote for the following line item:  LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each – Personnel Whole-Body Portal Contamination Monitor with the following required specifications:  

I. Type: The personnel contamination monitor shall be a microcomputer based, stand-and-count mode or walk-through mode portal monitor. The whole-body count shall be accomplished in a one step process whereby the user enters and positions himself in the monitor for a single count. As a minimum, the following areas shall be monitored: head, bottom of feet, upper and lower left and right sides.

II. Detector type: The detectors of the whole-body contamination monitor shall be solid plastic scintillator type.
    A. Detector specifications:
       1.  The minimum number of detectors shall be 6.
       2.  The minimum number of discrete body areas monitored and reported shall be 6.
3.	Effective dead zones between detectors shall be minimized by close-coupled detector arrays (i.e., no more than 6" between adjacent detectors), and by summing the output of adjacent detectors, with appropriate background correction and alarm settings.
4.	Each detector shall have its own photomultiplier and electronic board which	 contains high voltage supply, preamp/amplifier, discriminator and microcomputer.
5.	Each channel shall have an adjustable gain and discriminator to permit the operating point to be optimized for each detector.
6.	Each detector shall have user selectable parameters for alarm setpoint, efficiency, and background counts.
       7. The detectors shall have efficiencies of at least:
          a.  2.5% for a point Cs-137 source @ 3" from detector face.
          b.  13% for a point Co-60 source @ 3" from detector face.
       8.	Detector efficiencies and shield factors shall be calculated automatically or may be entered manually.
9.	The Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) for Co-60 shall be less than 1 kBq (27 nCi) for a 100 cm-sq  source at a distance of 10 cm from the detector face, at a confidence level of 95.00% and a false alarm rate of 0.0475%. Similarly, the Co-60 MDA for contamination on the surface of a detector (i.e., on the bottom of shoes) shall be less than 0.37 kBq (10 nCi). The unit shall be capable of detecting the stated MDA on any of the detectors in a 20 uR/hr background, with a maximum count time of 10 seconds.

III.   Display and Control
A.	All operating parameters shall be enterable via an IBM PC/compatible type computer. All communications software and system setup software shall be provided and shall not be "copy protected". Alternatively, if the software is copy protected a dedicated IBM PC/compatible computer shall be provided as part of the system.
B.	The unit shall have a user selectable mode where the unit computes its counting time based on the prescribed alarm levels and statistics of the background count and continuously updates its background data.
C.	The unit shall have user selectable parameters for count time, false alarm rate, and a confidence factor for probability of detection.
D.	The count cycle for an individual shall be initiated by an ultrasonic sensor /light beam combination. A visual indicator shall be provided to show the user that the count cycle has started, and for when it has finished.
E.	For background correction, the unit shall monitor the background, subtracting current background from each detector, and it shall utilize a background compensation algorithm allowing use in high or fluctuating background situations. The successful bidder shall provide specifics of the background algorithm. 
F.	The unit shall have a self-diagnostic program that shall, as a minimum, alert the user if:
       	1. There is a failure of any of the detectors.
       	2. Any of the detectors are contaminated.
3.Alarm settings are not currently achievable due to high background or statistical       variance.
G.	The unit shall have a diagnostic operating mode, whereby the system shall be operable with a computer attached to collect observed counts on each detector. The supplier shall provide the data collection software to perform this function, and to store the data to a user readable file, i.e., an ASCII file. The calibration software shall save the most current background count rates as well as the operating parameters for each portal monitor unit whenever QA monitoring is performed.
     H.	The unit shall be equipped with the following alarms:
1. Both visual indication and an audible alarm if contamination exceeds the alarm setpoint for any detector channel.
2. Visual indication if there is a problem with any of the functions monitored by the self-diagnostics program.
I. 	A simulator software program (IBM PC compatible) shall be provided which shows detectable activity levels and count times when the user-adjustable parameters are entered.
J.	The software shall have the capability to optionally log count and background data to a printer or computer via the com port without removing the portal monitor from service.

IV. Electronics
A.	The outputs from each detector shall be fed to a central processing unit or master communicator board, which includes a microprocessor, memory, and input/output lines.
     B. 	A nonvolatile memory shall be used to preserve system parameters.
     C. 	The electronics shall be designed for ease of accessibility, ease of troubleshooting/diagnostics for locating faults, and ease of replacement of individual components.

52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items;

Take note of the following stipulation:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)
(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;
