<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Eclipse Composite Engineering, LLC, 5715 Frolic Court, Herriman, UT 84065, for the purchase of the following item: 

18 inch diameter specialized composite material satellite dish, quantity 5.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

Sole Source Justification:
 
The authority is applicable since Eclipse Composite Engineering manufactures and is the only source that offers the required product. The dish must be made using carbon fiber composite technology to meet end user weight and ruggedness standards. The proprietary materials offered by Eclipse meet all requirements. Over the past year, AFRL has expended a great deal of effort in trying to provide a dish antenna that meets end user requirements. A number of composite materials were tested to find one that could match the electrical properties of a typical spun aluminum parabolic reflector. Only Eclipse's product could meet AFRL's total requirement for a very rugged, low-weight reflector that could equal the gain and efficiency performance of a standard aluminum reflector.

Delivery will be made to:
AFRL, Rome, NY 13441

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure the upgrade of two (2) Rotor Heads for the Whirl Tower.  It is the intent of the government to procure these supplies from Erickson Air Crane, Inc., 3100 Willow Springs Rd, Medford, OR, on a sole source basis using a Firm Fixed Price contract. Erickson Air Crane, Inc (EAC) is the only known certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) source that has the technical knowledge and experience with an authorized parts inventory to provide the required supplies in a turn-key, in-house operation without having to outsource for parts and repair services.  Sikorsky is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), but they no longer maintain an inventory of replacement parts and components. The OEM recommended that FRC East use EAC as an authorized source for parts for the Depot?s existing rotor-head assembly.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has a requirement for research and development in the area of Thermal and Mechanical Testing and Analysis of Materials for the High Temperature Materials Characterization Program. The period of performance will be for five years.  This is a follow-on requirement to contract N00167-97-C-0061, awarded to Southern Research Institute on a competitive basis. NSWCCD intends to solicit only one source, Southern Research Institute, 2000 Ninth Avenue South, Birmingham AL, and award a new cost plus fixed fee contract for this requirement. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2403(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The sole source is based upon the unique laboratory facilities, measurement instrumentation, and testing methodologies developed by Southern Research Institute to accurately characterize very high temperature materials in addition to their collection of high temperature materials databases.  Testing and analysis performed under this requirement include, but are not limited to, the following efforts:  Characterization of rhenium, tungsten, and other refractory metal propulsion materials provided in the form of plates, and solid and hollow cylindrical billets.  Characterization of monolithic ceramics provided in the form of discs, and solid and hollow cylindrical billets.  Characterization of continuous fiber reinforced ceramic composites provided in the form of plates, and solid and hollow cylindrical billets.  Characterization of carbon-phenolic heatshield and nozzle materials in the form of plates, frusta, and cylinders.  The typical mechanical and thermal testing performed by the contractor shall be conducted at various temperatures from 70 degrees Fahrenheit up to 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Materials characterization continues and extends property databases initiated under contract N00167-97-C-0061, awarded to Southern Research Institute.  Typical tests co!  nsist of tension, compression, flexure, shear, conductivity, and thermal expansion in various directions and orientations as dictated by the material fabrication process.  Other specialized tests may be required, including, fatigue, biaxial tension, and combined tension-compression.  High accuracy strain measurements and loading systems are required to ensure database fidelity.  The contractor shall perform non-destructive characterization of candidate materials on a selected basis.  The measurements may include visual inspection with documentation, alcohol wipe inspection, bulk gravimetric density, ultrasonic velocity, ultrasonic attenuation, spectral acoustics, radiography radiometric density, and open porosity.  Based upon the requirements of the test matrices the contractor shall prepare cutting plans to be used for removing specimen blanks from the bulk shapes.  The contractor shall have a procedure for tracking all materials and specimens in the program.  The contract!  or shall support aging studies as required on materials with the poten tial for time-varying properties.  The contractor shall provide analysis support and phenomenological studies to include specialty tests to isolate and determine particular phenomenon or behaviors that fall outside what is generally included in material characterization.  The contractor shall perform sub-scale, high temperature testing of propulsion or heatshield materials or components to identify material response to complex and combined loading conditions.  Substantial documentation of will be required.   The point of contact is Laura Rider at laura.rider@navy.mil.  Note 22 applies to the extent that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>Provide A/E Qualifications for construction of a Cardiology Step-Down Unit at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, SC.  The required services shall include schematic design concept (15%) design development (60%), preparation of final construction documents including cost estimate for the 100% level, selected post construction period service, post construction as-builts, and other task related to these services for Project 534-08-109.  The proposed construction is to renovate some respiratory and pulmonary space next to the Cardiology Department and the Cardiac Cath Labs into an appropriate Cardiology Step Down Unit for Cardiology patients.  The primary intent is to have a unit that can support the utilization of the cardiology catherization room and possibly other heart procedures that would need a step down recovery area before release to the surgical/medical wards and/or to outpatient surgical areas.  A nurse's station (and/or area/alcove), recovery area/rooms for the cardiology patients with medical gas, electrical power (both normal and emergency), lighting, telemetry, data lines, etc. will be part of the design and determination of the layout for the area.  Secondary intents would be to be able to utilize the area as a possible swing space for either MICU or SICU during a possible renovation of the areas and also to be utilized as an Ambulatory Care Surgery Observations area if excess capacity might exist.  Meetings with Nursing and medical staff for programming (exact determination of the space layout and resultant engineering needs will be required.  Project will also require the coordination of relocation of some of the cardiology functions within approximately the same area as the step down units.  Exit determination will be during the programming meetings, but it appears that the exact stress test area, EKG reading rooms, and holters  scanning area will have to be relocated within the same general space.  Approximately 4,000 SF of space will be renovated.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.   Consideration is limited to concerns located within a 200 mile radius of VAMC, Charleston, SC.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541310.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The object of the solicitation is to obtain off-site digitization services to scan official SDDC Fort Eustis, VA records.  The Government requires physical access within 24 hours  no faxing of documents because the Government might need entire box.  This must be accomplished at no cost to the Government.  Digitization services must be within 50 miles of Fort Eustis, VA.  The SDDC Operations Center at Fort Eustis has a requirement to complete scanning documents for G6(145 boxes) and G8(105 boxes).  Al l scanned documents must be compatible with and loaded into the command standard Hummingbird EDM System version 5.1.0.5. The contractor will be required to convert hard copy official records into electronic format at the contractors facility.  The digitiz ed documents are to be delivered on CD-ROM discs in a format yet to be determined (i.e., tif, pdf, etc.) for future retrieval of documents and indexed data from the Hummingbird system.  No DVDs, only CDs are available for usage on the servers. Scanning may  require electronic digital enhancement of scanned images to improve readability to include de-skewing, cropping, speckle-removal, and/or rotation.  The conversion project will include transportation of the boxed files, document preparation, scanning and i ndexing (up to 10 fields), reassembling boxed files and return to our facility.  The boxes are standard file boxes, not bankers boxes.  The boxes will be available in stages.  Not all the boxes are available at one time because some of the files are being  used daily and will have to be boxed when ready to be scanned and then be returned in a reasonable time.  Document preparation may involve removing staples and/or paperclips or other clips used to bind the documents.  Estimates are 12-15 pages per folder.   Documents to be converted are primarily 8 ? x 11, but may include sizes up to up to 11 x 17.  The 11 x 17 are estimated to be 15 percent.  Majority of documents are on standard office paper, but may include some onionskin or other carbon copies and compu ter generated reports on pin-fed paper.  Grayscale is acceptable.  Duplex documents are estimated at 5 percent.  There will be indexing for 1-9 indexed fields.  There will be a list of fields available to the awarded vendor.  Indexing is on every page.  Th e largest indexed field size could be up to 12 alpha-numeric characters. The indexing fields are usually located on the first page.  Contractor will make an on-site visit to coordinate with POC for schedule of work. No limit on number of onsite visits, mus t be coordinated with POC at SDDC.  Documents to be digitized will be unclassified and will be in appropriately labeled boxes.  The documents are indexed as determined by the designated POC and will be attached to every box.  After documents have been digi tized and recorded on CD-ROM, the CD-ROM and documents will be returned to SDDC Operations Center.  All documents are to be returned to the original folder, original box and delivered to SDDC Fort Eustis, 661 Sheppard Place, Fort Eustis, VA.  The base peri od of performance is 26 Nov 2007 until 28 Mar 2008.  The contractor will be required to provide periodic updates and onsite visits at contractors expense as required.  The proposal should include labor costs, administrative and overhead costs, BPA fees, t ransport fees etc.  Pricing should be per box.  Award will be on a low cost, technically acceptable basis.  Any questions must be submitted no later then 7 Nov 2007, 12:00PM email or via phone 757-878-8366.   Proposal shall include DUNs number, Cage code, business size and GSA number if applicable and a contact address and phone number.  Proposals should be three pages or less and be emailed to spencerm@sddc.army.mil no later then 13 Nov 2007, 12:00 pm.

Phone inquiries may not be returned.  All correspondence shall be in writing and submitted to the email address pr ovided.  THIS ACQUISITION IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS VENDORS ONLY.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A small business set-aside solicitation shall be issued with competition limited to eligible small business firms for Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Supplies (ie: concrete, steel, railroad rail, rip rap, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, miscellaneous small tools, and other miscellaneous construction building and maintenance materials).  The supply requ irements are to support the development of new TI construction and or the operations and maintenance (repair and alteration) to tactical infrastructure for the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection/Border Patrol (DHS/CBP/BP).  Contr actors will be required to provide resources to accommodate rapid response, in remote locations, for the supply requirements.  Contractors will be required to deliver supplies under a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis within the full scope of work needed to sup port the infrastructure supply need.   The primary location for these MATOCs shall be for projects in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Yuma Arizona Sector.   These MATOCs may also be used for projects located in the CBP Tucson, San Diego, El Centro, El Paso, Marfa, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley Sectors, if required to support DHS/CBP program requirements.  Typical supplies include, but are not limited to, items such as concrete, steel, railroad rail and other equipment, rip rap, Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) materials, sign materials, survey materials, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, light poles and accessories, lighting assemblies (fixtures), power distribution equipment (high and low voltage electrica l distribution supplies), electrical wiring, conduit, paving materials, lumber, fasteners, paint and associated material, concrete, asphalt, steel materials, concrete pipe, (caulking, etc.), gabion materials, culverts, wire mesh and other miscellaneous con struction building materials, pre-cast vehicle and pedestrian barriers, gates, temporary fencing, etc.  Some incidental tools related to the installation of supplies will be included (ie; welding tools, etc.)   It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solicitation with a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) for award of up to four (4) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for the Yuma Sectors TI supply support.  These four MATOC Contracts a re considered a pool for the Yuma Sector.  Each task order shall be competed amongst the contractors in the pool.  The estimated duration for each contract will be an initial base period term of twelve (12) months, with up to four (4) option period terms o f twelve (12) months each, for a maximum contract term not to exceed sixty (60) months/five (5) years.   Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory/concerns; 2) until contract ex piration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) unless the contract is terminated for convenience of the Government.  Each contractor in the Yuma MATOC pool has the competitive opportunity to receive t ask order awards up to the shared MATOC pool estimated contract capacity of $95 Million.   Typically the pool of up to four (4) Yuma MATOCs described above will be for performance by the MATOC pool closest to where the project requirement exists (e.g., Yuma, AZ project requirement will be first considered for performance by the Yuma, AZ MATOC po ol of vendors, before consideration is provided for performance by another MATOC pool).  However, magnitude of the project, the existing work load of the MATOC pool and past performance will also be considered.  If a contractor fails to perform, becomes in capable of performance, or performs so poorly that the Contracting Officer makes the determination that the risk is too high to proceed with the preferred Sector MATOC vendors, then the task order may be awarded to another MATOC in the pool.  It is likely that several MATOCs will be performing several task orders at the same time.  If the set-aside MATOC awards cannot be achieved for a particular Border Patrol Sector, the first option would be to award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) IDIQ to a se t-aside contractor for the maximum capacity the vendor is qualified to execute.  The remaining capacity for that Border Patrol Sector will then be equally distributed among the other successful set-aside MATOC pools.  This process will be included in the p ublic notice as well as the solicitation to advise the set-aside contractors of the possibility that the contract capacity may increase if a set-aside MATOC for a particular Border Patrol Sector cannot be achieved.  The MATOCs shall include contract terms and conditions to accommodate the potential need to include the task order scope of work under Indefinite Delivery Contracts (ref:  FAR 16.500 and DFARS 216.501).   The minimum guarantee for each MATOC contract will be $10,000.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated by the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitat ion will be $3,000.00.   The estimated maximum task order limitation is $2 million.  With the agreement of both parties task orders may be awarded over the stated maximum task order threshold.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government with price and technical evaluation factors.  Procurement consideration will be given to technical capability (including experienc e, past performance, delivery, and price).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 423390 (Other Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers), which corresponds to SIC 5039.  The size standard for NAI CS code 423390 is 500 employees.  This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.  Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only.  It is, therefore, the contractors responsibility to check the below- listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.   A separate synopsis and solicitation for the other small business and socio-economic groups, i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) is also being issued in the near future.  The 8(a); HUBZone, and SDVOSB will all b e competitive set-asides.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about November 21, 2007.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about December 28, 2007.  Contractors are encouraged to utilize the functions in FedBizOpps.

Phone inquiries may not be returned.  All correspondence shall be in writing and submitted to the email address pr ovided.   THIS ACQUISITION IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS VENDORS ONLY.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A competitive 8(a) set-aside solicitation shall be issued with competition limited to eligible 8(a) business firms fo r Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Supplies (ie: concrete, steel, railroad rail, rip rap, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, miscellaneous small tools, and other miscellaneous construction building and maintenance materials).  The supply requirements  are to support the development of new TI construction and or the operations and maintenance (repair and alteration) to tactical infrastructure for the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection/Border Patrol (DHS/CBP/BP).  Contractors w ill be required to provide resources to accommodate rapid response, in remote locations, for the supply requirements.  Contractors will be required to deliver supplies under a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis within the full scope of work needed to support the  infrastructure supply need.   The primary location for these MATOCs shall be for projects in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the El Paso and Marfa Texas Sectors areas.  These MATOCs may also be used for projects located in the  CBP Tucson, Yuma, San Diego, El Centro, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley Sectors, if required to support DHS/CBP program requirements.  Typical supplies include, but are not limited to, items such as concrete, steel, railroad rail and other equipmen t, rip rap, Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) materials, sign materials, survey materials, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, light poles and accessories, lighting assemblies (fixtures), power distribution equipment (high and low voltage el ectrical distribution supplies), electrical wiring, conduit, paving materials, lumber, fasteners, paint and associated material, concrete, asphalt, steel materials, concrete pipe, (caulking, etc.), gabion materials, culverts, wire mesh and other miscellane ous construction building materials, pre-cast vehicle and pedestrian barriers, gates, temporary fencing, etc.  Some incidental tools related to the installation of supplies will be included (ie; welding tools, etc.)   It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solicitation with an 8(a) Set-Aside for award of up to four (4) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for the El Paso and Marfa Texas Sectors TI supply support.  These four MATOC Contract s are considered a pool for the El Paso and Marfa Sectors.  Each task order shall be competed amongst the contractors in the pool.  The estimated duration for each contract will be an initial base period term of twelve (12) months, with up to four (4) opti on period terms of twelve (12) months each, for a maximum contract term not to exceed sixty (60) months/five (5) years.   Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory/concerns; 2)  until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) unless the contract is terminated for convenience of the Government.  Each contractor in the El Paso Marfa MATOC pool has the competiti ve opportunity to receive task order awards up to the shared MATOC pool estimated contract capacity of $50 Million.   Typically the pool of up to four (4) El Paso and Marfa Sector MATOCs described above will be for performance by the MATOC pool closest to where the project requirement exists (e.g., El Paso and Marfa Texas project requirement will be first considered for p erformance by the El Paso and Marfa MATOC pool of vendors, before consideration is provided for performance by another MATOC pool).  However, magnitude of the project, the existing work load of the MATOC pool and past performance will also be considered. If a contractor fails to perform, becomes incapable of performance, or performs so poorly that the Contracting Officer makes the determination that the risk is too high to proceed with the preferred Sector MATOC vendors, then the task order may be awarded to another MATOC in the pool.  It is likely that several MATOCs will be performing several task orders at the same time.  If the set-aside MATOC awards cannot be achieved for a particular Border Patrol Sector, the first option would be to award a Single Aw ard Task Order Contract (SATOC) IDIQ to a set-aside contractor for the maximum capacity the vendor is qualified to execute.  The remaining capacity for that Border Patrol Sector will then be equally distributed among the other successful set-aside MATOC po ols.  This process will be included in the public notice as well as the solicitation to advise the set-aside contractors of the possibility that the contract capacity may increase if a set-aside MATOC for a particular Border Patrol Sector cannot be achieve d.  The MATOCs shall include contract terms and conditions to accommodate the potential need to include the task order scope of work under Indefinite Delivery Contracts (ref:  FAR 16.500 and DFARS 216.501).   The minimum guarantee for each MATOC contract will be $10,000.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated by the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitat ion will be $3,000.00.   The estimated maximum task order limitation is $2 million.  With the agreement of both parties task orders may be awarded over the stated maximum task order threshold.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government with price and technical evaluation factors.  Procurement consideration will be given to technical capability (including experienc e, past performance, delivery, and price).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 423390 (Other Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers), which corresponds to SIC 5039.  The size standard for NAI CS code 423390 is 500 employees.  This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.  Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only.  It is, therefore, the contractors responsibility to check the below- listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.   A separate synopsis and solicitation for the other small business and socio-economic groups, i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) is also being issued in the near future.  The 8(a); HUBZone, and SDVOSB will all b e competitive set-asides.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about November 21, 2007.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about December 28, 2007.  Contractors are encouraged to utilize the functions in FedBizOpps.  Offerors must be regist ered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), in order to receive a Government contract award.  To register, the CCR Internet address is: http://www.ccr.gov.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  

6.

<SUBJECT>J -- Organizational Level Maintenance and RESET Support for United States Marine Corps Aircraft
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-301-757-3073
<RESPDATE>120707
<ARCHDATE>12222007
<CONTACT>Gregory Lee, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-9056, Fax 301-757-2526, Email gregory.lee@navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking sources to perform Organizational Level Maintenance in support of the Marine Corps RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, FA-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, C-130J, AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support will be required both inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS) at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, SC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa Japan; Al Asad, Iraq.  Services may also be required at other OCONUS locations in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).

The primary goal of the Marine Corps RESET Project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the RESET Project will employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which will include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program will feature three distinct RESET events for each aircraft:

(1) A PRESET, which will be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) A RECONSTITUTION, which will be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level; 
(3) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT which will be performed as needed on all deployed Aircraft in GWOT operations, in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET.

These events will be performed according to a set schedule, although some variability in this schedule is expected because of the exigencies of the battlefield and the needs of the operational units in question.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is for the contractor to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines by performing general Organizational Level Maintenance when not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on an aircraft platform by aircraft platform basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as nine (9) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.  The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) basis, though the contract shall contain some Cost-Plus or Time and Material elements to address the secondary goal outlined above.  The Government will make final decisions on the set-asides based on market research and responses from this Request for Information (RFI), as well as other procurement and program related criteria.

Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.  Information should be provided by electronic mail to Mr. Gregory Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil, with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at rita.pegg@navy.mil.  At a minimum, responses should include company name, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past five (5) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.  The deadline for submission of information is 7 Dec 07 at 2:30 pm.  This information is being requested for purposes of market research.  The Government will use this information to develop a list of potential bidders which will be published at a later date.

Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the email addresses cited above.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.

AMENDMENT 1: THE GOVERNMENT SHALL POST ANSWERS TO ANY QUESTIONS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON FEDBIZOPS BY 2:30 PM, 14 DEC 07.

<DESC>The 95th Contracting Squadron (95CONS) is seeking potential sources capable of performing Oil/Water Separator Services for Edwards AFB, CA.  The contractor shall provide all management, personnel, tools, vehicles, supplies, materials, equipment, and labor necessary to maintain and repair oil water separators (OWS) located at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), in accordance with the manufacturer?s operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals, and federal, state, local environmental laws and regulations.  All work shall comply with government and commercial standards, whichever is more stringent.  The contractor shall also be responsible for preventive maintenance and repairs to the high-pressure sprayer system at Bldg. #9505, Precision Impact Range Area (PIRA).  For each oil water separator system, the contractor?s responsibility begins at the clarifier (or initial entry storage) and ends where the effluent enters the sewer system; typically where the above ground piping transitions to the underground. Contract award is estimated to take place August 2008. Source Selection procedures can be found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.3-Source Selection, Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) and the Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement (AFMCFARS) thereto. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil and will be used to obtain the best value for the Government for this acquisition. In using the best value approach, the Government will award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that they will best satisfy our requirements in an affordable manner. The draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted incrementally on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This synopsis constitutes one form of early industry involvement and the Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback. This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Prospected vendor must provide proof of small business representation through the Central Contract Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. 

 		5352.201-9101     OMBUDSMAN     (AUG 2005)

(a)     An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party.

(b)     Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c)     If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

(d)     The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

(e)     Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capablility of potential small businesses, (including 8(a), services disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, veteran-owned small business, and women owned small business) that can provide FDA with accurate and timely assessments and evaluations of the economic impacts of FDA actions or contemplated actions. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any small business sources with capabilities or prior experience that can provide FDA with accurate and timely assessments and evaluations of the economic impacts of FDA actions. The FDA has a requirement for accurate and timely economic assessments of FDA regulatory actions. Activities under the proposed contract will include, although not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) Methods Development - While the economic impact of certain FDA regulatory actions can be analyzed via an established methodology, other FDA initiatives will require novel analytical approaches to evaluate potential effects of economic impacts on consumers, the agency, and the regulated industry. (2) Baseline Measurement - The FDA needs baseline data on the economic characteristics of regulated industries in order to estimate economic impact. These data may include the number and size of firms and the employment, sales, and number of stock keeping units (labels). In many instances, industry profile studies will require supporting documentation for OMB survey clearance procedures. (3) Impact Assessments-Since the FDA is required to prepare comprehensive Economic Impact Analysis for significant regulations under Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the expected impact of each agency rule must be reviewed to determine whether or not it will be considered significant. Both significant and non-significant assessments require extensive familiarity with numerous aspects of the regulated industries. A majority of these analyses require a high level of specialized and technical expertise and must withstand intense technical review and scrutiny. Generic capability statements will not suffice. Respondents must address their capability, experience and knowledge directly related to the three requirements listed above. In the response, firms must provide their business size status in accordance with the Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) for the referenced NAICS code (ex. small business, 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disabled Veteran Owned Business, etc.), DUNS number, Tax Identification Number, company name, address, email, telephone number, web-site (if available), and a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives. Identification of the firm's GSA schedule and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested. To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. The potential North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690, with size limitation standards of $6.5M. All interested sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before they can be considered as potential sources. Interested offerors should submit their capability statement not exceeding fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures. SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE no later than 5:00pm, Eastern Time, November 20. The capabilities response shall be e-mailed to: Dominique.Malone@fda.hhs.gov. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the notice will not be returned. Information provided in response to this notice will be used to assess alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. The FDA will use the information submitted in response to this notice at its discretion and will not provide comments to any submission; however, the content of any responses to this notice may be reflected in subsequent Request For Proposals (RFPs). FDA reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing FDA's understanding of the notice submission. It is emphasized that this is a notice for planning and information purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.

The HMA is a mechanical device that attaches the AN/PVS-7B, AN/PVS-7D and AN/PVS 14 Night Vision Device (NVD) systems to the Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet, Combat Vehicle Crewman (CVC) helmet and the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH). It consi sts of three major components; a Front Bracket, Strap Assembly and Mount. The Front Bracket hooks onto the front edge of the helmet and can either be fastened directly to the helmet using the existing mounting aperture and ballistics hardware, or attached to the helmet with a strap assembly. The Strap Assembly consists of a tension strap used to attach the bracket to the helmet and a nape strap attached to the back of the tension strap and is used to counter the weight of the attached NVD system. The Mount clips into the Front Bracket, attaches to and supports the NVD systems, and provides for adjustments to the system position. DESCRIPTION - The HMA shall attach securely to the PASGT, ACH and CVC helmets with protective camouflage cover installed without affecting the protective qualities of the helmet. The HMA shall utilize or be compatible with the currently fielded Front Brack et Assemblies (Government drawings A3256371 and A3297307). The HMA shall accept the AN/PVS-7B, -7D and -14 NVD systems (including Headset Adapter, NSN 5965-01-444-1216). The HMA shall hold the NVD securely in place during normal operation and make the syst em free for release with one hand when the systems release latch is activated. Removal of a system using the system latch while the system is operating shall cause the NVD system to shut off. The HMA shall include adjustments for quick helmet release, fli p-up (out of sight)/flip-down (system operation), line-of-sight tilt (above and below horizontal), and fore-aft eye relief distance. The flip-up/flip-down mechanism shall not require the user to push, pull or twist any button, lever or knob. Each mechanica l adjustment shall consist of a single control and be designed for one-handed operation. When the AN/PVS-7B, -7D, or -14 system is installed in the helmet mount and operating, flipping the assembly up from the system operation position to the out of sight position shall cause the system to automatically shut off.  ACQUISITION - The anticipated acquisition strategy for the award is as follows: [1] Full and open competition; [2] It is the Governments intention to make one award; however, additional awards may be considered; and [3] Contract will be a five (5) year In definite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The minimum quantity is anticipated to be approximately 5000 HMAs per month. This is not an RFP. Suppliers interested in the ID/IQ contract are encouraged to monitor the U.S. Army Single Face to Indus try (ASFI) for further program information. RESPONSES - Desired information includes company name, address, point of contact and phone number, and literature or descriptive information concerning your product. Website URL is acceptable. The lack of response will not exclude you from any future procu rement that might occur. Your response to this Market Survey does not constitute the start of negotiations.

<SUBJECT>Intent to Issue Level of Effort Modification for CTB Operations and Maintenance Support
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center - San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to increase the level of effort for contract N66001-05-D-0009 originally awarded to KES 19 October 2004 in the amount of $28,873,621.49 which is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract with a cost-plus-fixed-fee pricing arrangement.  The contract provides Combined Test Bed operation and maintenance support services for SSC-SD, Code 245, Tactical Systems Integration and Interoperability Division with a two-year base period and one three-year option period.  The current contract expires 18 October 2009.  SSC-SD intends to issue a sole-source modification to KES to increase the number of estimated hours by 105,000 and the overall contract amount by $9,145,000.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed to Natalie Walker at natalie.j.walker@navy.mil. The use of any other source for this modification would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractors workforce resulting in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Furthermore, a follow-on, competitive procurement has been initiated that may be awarded by December 2008, prior to the expiration of the current contract.  See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Silent 911 Dialer-Personal Protective Equipment for Taxi Drivers and Lone Workers
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work with a safety-equipment manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the Silent 911 Dialer, a personal safety system for taxi drivers and other workers who work alone. This system is being developed by a NIOSH safety research project.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of taxi drivers by bringing the Silent 911 Dialer into the marketplace.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner chosen will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the Silent 911 Dialer a viable and profitable piece of safety equipment.

The Taxi Services sub-sector has the highest homicide rate among all sub-sectors. In 2004, the Taxi and Limousine Service industry had 37 occupational homicide victims with a homicide rate of 18.2/100,000 workers (number of workers:  203,000), compared with 551 homicide victims and a homicide rate of 0.396/100,000 workers in all U.S industries (number of workers: 139.3 M).  All of these 37 homicide victims were employed in the Taxi Services sub-sector.  Two hundred and eighty-seven taxi drivers were murdered at work between 1980 and 1989 and 510 more were murdered between 1992 and 1998.  Taxi drivers are also victims to non-fatal assaults (184/1,000 workers between 1992 and 1998, third highest among the sub-sectors).   Safety measures must be implemented to protect taxi drivers and other lone workers from occupational assaults and homicides.

The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost wireless emergency dialer for the taxi services industry (NAICS 48531), in order to enable them to silently communicate with the rescue unit and/or colleague/family members of their emergency status when they face the danger of assault, robbery or murder. The following are the basic concepts of the Silent 911 Dialer system:

*	The dialer device consists of a docking station with a size similar to a cigarette pack and a wireless-trigger with a size similar to a car-keyless-door-control pad. 
*	The wireless-trigger has an emergency button and a warning button with different shapes, and a silent vibrator on its panel.  The trigger can be mounted on a taxi-driver?s knee, toe, or in a nearby secret place.  
*	The docking station connects with a cellular-phone and can be placed in a hidden place in a taxi-cab.
*	The Trigger communicates with the docking station via a radio frequency (RF) transmission. 
*	Faced with danger, the driver can silently click the emergency-button on the trigger, which transmits a RF signal to the docking station, to activate the cellular-phone. The cellular-phone dials an emergency number, sends a pre-recorded message, enables the built-in assisted-Global-Positioning-System (GPS) in the phone, and/or triggers an external visual alarm.  
*	With less dangerous situations, the driver can silently click the warning-button on the trigger to silently activate the cell-phone to dial a number to let a colleague/family-member monitor the taxi-cab situation.
*	The rescuer and colleague/family member can silently communicate with the driver by pushing their phone digit pad.  As the cell-phone receives the phone digits, it passes the digits to the docking station, which translates the digits to the correspondent message and transmits the message to the trigger.  The trigger passes on the message to the driver via the vibrator. The driver receives the message by feeling the vibration patterns on the trigger.
*	The dialer cost (not including cellular-phone) should be lower than $100 or even not to exceed $50 if it is possible. 
*	Optionally, the trigger may have a special button to activate other radio-frequency controllable safety measures inside/outside the taxicab, such as external emergency visual sign, partition window, door windows, and door locks to further protect the taxi driver or other workers.

We hope that the widespread use of this low-cost device will eventually reduce occupational assault and homicide rates in the taxi-services industry and other industries.

The project is currently in the system development phase.  Electronic circuits and software/firmware development is underway.  The whole system development is scheduled to be completed in early 2008. 

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, will be considered based on their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the Silent 911 Dialer into commercial production.   This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an MOU with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

The Silent 911 Dialer Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Provide significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing personal safety/security equipment.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of the personal safety/security equipment market.  Also, assistance will be given in setting realistic product cost objectives and providing suggestions on how the Silent 911 Dialer can achieve product cost goals - Required;  

(B) Fabricate prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Provide expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations; 

(D) Review testing methods and recommend appropriate, new testing criteria; and

(E) Review test results and recommend design modifications.

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas.  A company that is qualified and currently producing electrical personal protective equipment is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of equipment similar to Silent 911 Dialer is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this announcement will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement.  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period.  If any data are to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included by the vendors with a statement of propriety.  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged.  The government has identified January 8th and 9th, 2008 for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

The Act is the most recent in a series of Congressional initiatives beginning in 1955 to expand the  scope of enfranchisement for U.S. citizen participation in elections for Federal offices. The FVAP also carries out the Department of Defense responsibilities under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the purpose of which is to promote voter regis tration and participation in the electoral process. The FVAP and its predecessor organizations have historically provided a wide range of services and information to promote and facilitate participation in the national voting process. The Get-Out-the-Vote Campaign is a program activity that has been performed since the early 1970s. The purpose of this campaign is to promote citizen participation in the political process by encouraging them to register and to vote. The initial focus of this effort was on the Uniformed Services and it was carried out in close coordination with the Mili tary Departments.

The M&E Specialist will also be supported to participate in key technical working groups (the Monitoring and Evaluation and Information Systems Technical Working Group at the National AIDS Commission and the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research Technical Working Group at Ministry of Health) to ensure enhanced coordination, harmonization, and strengthening of M&E Systems. The M&E Specialist will work closely with Government of Malawi (GOM) officials responsible for monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS programs. The M&E Specialist is expected to establish and maintain close relationship with all international development partner representatives and GOM officials working in these areas to ensure consistency and harmony of results reporting and to develop shared languages around issues of attribution.  The M&E Specialist is also expected to participate in the collaboration and coordination of activities with other international partners present in country (e.g., World Health Organizations (WHO), UNAIDS, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), and World Bank).

in some cases State, income taxes on salaries earned abroad while working for the U.S. Government.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

SOCIAL SECURITY, FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND FOREIGN EARNED INCOME 
 
   (a)  Since the contractor is an employee, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.
 
   (b) As an employee, the contractor is not eligible for the 'foreign earned income' exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911- 3(c)(3)).

     (3)  Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts.  The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas.  In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.
 
     (4)  Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.  On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.

CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider.  Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of  contract performance.  CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract.  In order for CDC to reimburse the cost of medevac insurance, CDC shall require the contractor to furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders and its cost, after issuance of an offer letter.

BACKGROUND:

Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is a DoD Field Activity under the Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA). DMDC purchased TeamQuest software in 2004 and this performance software is a suite of four integrated products that help DMDC optimize IT services, from performance management and reporting to event monitoring and capacity modeling.

TeamQuest View and TeamQuest on the Web have been used at DMDC to monitor system performance on a minute by minute basis.  DMDC System Administrators have access to this system performance data and use the data to quickly determine causes of performance degradation, enabling their administrators to take immediate action and make decisions to prevent future outages.

TeamQuest has also been used at DMDC for future system capacity planning using the Modeling/Capacity planning aspect of the software to ensure their systems are sufficient to meet required service levels as well as prevent underutilization, and used to create customized reports.  These customized reports assist DMDC management.

DMDC requires customization of the Alert feature of TeamQuest to enhance DMDC?s ability to report on system SLA's and be more predictive in reporting system issues, help DMDC optimize IT services, refine performance management, improve event monitoring, and scale to all servers in our environment.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is set-aside for small business only. The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 561492, with a size standard of $6,500,000 average annual gross revenues. Solicitation/Purchase Request number 52-2007NA29412.000 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20 effective September 6, 2007.

Warranty details, delivery schedule and any other information necessary for the Government to perform a technical evaluation must be submitted.  No further request will be made to obtain required information and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration.  Award will be made relative to overall best value, which will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all requirements, but offers which exceed requirements may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, EvaluationCommercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) capability of the offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) price; and (iii) past performance.  All other evaluation factors, when combined, are slightly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that aCoast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

INTRODUCTION

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

OBJECTIVE

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

* Develop and interpret management policies and procedures, provide budget analyses of program proposals, provide support services, and develop program funded budgets for DART support;
* Assist with initial assessments of the vulnerable population and recommend appropriate relief activities, facilitating and coordinating actual USG emergency response activities with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy; 
* Liaise with other responders (i.e., government agencies, international organizations or private and voluntary organizations), coordinating efforts to ensure that adequate resources are available to the international response effort, briefing host governments, the U.S. Military, U.S. Embassy and the USAID Mission; 
* Interpret USAID regulations and apply them to DART activities; 
* Participate in appropriate training either as a participant and/or trainer;

<DESC>This notice is a sole source combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a sole source Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Chemwatch Internet Chemical Database (Quantity=1 JOB):  Period of Performance: 2 years from start of contract. Quarterly Updates Chemwatch CD Rom System for NASA Validated chemical information by the independent research of Chemwatch.  Follow-on to contract NNK06OU05P  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-19. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541511 and $23 million respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.  This is a sole source acquisition to Global Chemical Data, Inc. (doing business as ChemWatchNA) for the following reasons:  The Chemwatch product is needed as it would be considerably more expensive to go with another vendor as we would have to not only buy but deploy and train a completely new system NASA-wide.  This system has been used since 2002 NASA wide and there is great familiarity and use of the information for occupational health and emergency response.  Any different system would be more expensive to implement, as there would be a considerable learning period associated with same.  This requirement was last renewed on order NNK06OU05P.	The other requirement we must have, and is unique to this vendor, is the validated chemical information by the independent research of Chemwatch.  Although there are many vendors that provide a on-line chemical database and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) service, Global Chemical?s Chemwatch was the only provider that went beyond a mere compilation of manufacturer?s data but provided their own validated chemical information of the research.  This is absolutely necessary as there are many errors and gaps in information in vendor supplied MSDS?, which could delay medical treatment in case of an accident.  The NASA medical and environmental community needs to have this validation for emergency medical treatment for accidents and injuries with chemicals. This is a follow on to a previous contract therefore further market research was not conducted.	The cost of buying a new system will outweigh any potential savings as a result of competition.  The manufacture of this product does not use any distributors; therefore they are the only available source.  Any other responsible sources may submit an offer providing adequate information to determine equivalency and a foreseeable savings to the Government and this shall be considered by the agency.  Delivery to KSC is required within 30 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  Offers for the items(s) described above are due by 4:30 PM EDT/ 11/15/07 to Ellen Lamp/OP-OS NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899 or email to Ellen.Lamp@nasa.gov and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.  Offerors are encouraged to use the Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at URL:  http://server-mpo.arc.nasa.gov/Services/NEFS/NEFSHome.tml.  See Attached Solicitation. Offerors shall provide the information required by FAR 52.212-1 (SEP 2006), Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, which is incorporated by reference.  If the end product(s) offered is other than domestic end product(s) as defined in the clause entitled "Buy American Act -- Supplies," the offeror shall so state and shall list the country of origin.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
		High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
		Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
		Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required; 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.    

b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.
