In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is  Airborne radio communications equipment manufacturing with a size standard of 12,500 employees.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
  
Background:

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), also known internationally as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), are an important new addition to the National Airspace System (NAS).  While there are countless ideas for the use of this new technology, there currently is no direct path for certifying these systems for safe operation within the airspace.  In the U.S., the RTCA has been developing standards that detail requirements which, when met, will help to validate such equipment for future operations.  The RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-288) has two working groups which are developing these standards.  SC-228 WG-1 is focused on Detect and Avoid (DAA) while WG-2 is focused on the Terrestrial Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) Link.  Throughout the standards development process, much testing and analysis must occur in order to validate the proposed requirements.  To this end, in support of SC-228 WG-2, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, as a trusted and independent FAA test facility, has been tasked with performing interference testing against a range of L-band radios that are currently used within the NAS for navigation and surveillance.  Again, the goal of testing is to quantify the effect, if any, that a CNPC radio link may have upon these radios.  

The FAA Technical Center began this interference testing in the second half of 2016 with a bench test of an airborne TACAN radio.  The TACAN testing was intended to be the first step in testing a range of L-band navigation and surveillance radios, including: Mode S Transponder, TCAS II, Airborne DME, GNSS Receiver, Ground DME, and ATCRBS Transponder.  While some of these radios are readily available for testing within the FAA laboratory, others (Mode S, TCAS, Airborne DME, GNSS) need to be sourced from an equipment manufacturer.  This effort will continue to test the effects that a CNPC radio link may have upon existing radios.


PURPOSE:

This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:

All responders must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the following (in order):

a.	Demonstrate your ability to provide the following systems:
â€¢	Airborne DME.

â€¢	TCAS II v7.1 with ADS-B In receiver equipage class A3.
b.	Demonstrate your ability to provide the technical expertise necessary to integrate and troubleshoot the above listed radios in a laboratory environment. This work is intended to be performed at the William J Hughes Technical Center. This work is expected to be performed at a Factory Acceptance Test level.
c.	Demonstrate your ability to provide applicable accessories, materials required to support system integration with laboratory test equipment.  
d.	Demonstrate your ability to collect and record test data to include signal capturing and processing for the above listed radios.

This Market Survey IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. It is a market research tool being used to assist in the determination of an acquisition plan. Appropriate acquisition planning will be determined after consideration of industry responses to this announcement and other factors. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. This market survey is being issued to assist the FAA in meeting ongoing requirements for miscellaneous construction services for:  alteration, maintenance, repair, conversion, and/or modernization of existing facilities.  This also includes new construction if required.  These services will be required for commercial, industrial, and utility type of facilities located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  Contractors shall provide, but not limited to, all labor, materials, and equipment required for all work as described in the applicable contract documents.   

The FAA contemplates a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in the Electrical Contractors and other Wiring Installation Contractors (NAICS 238210 Size Standard $15.0M).

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Silicon Sublimation Cell
<SOLNBR>SB1341-18-RQ-0046
<RESPDATE>113017
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with United Mineral and Chemical Corp of 1050 Wall Street West, Lyndhurst, New Jersey, 07071 for the purchase of a Silicon Sublimation Cell for NIST's Engineering Physics Division (EPD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The NIST EPD provides leadership in conducting research in the areas of dimensional, nanometer-scale, surface, and acoustic pressure metrology; accelerometry; silicon Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology; MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS); power electronics; nanoelectronics; and flexible/printed electronics. The Atom-based laboratory in EPD is developing the capability for fabricating atomic scale devices based on atomically precise lithography and selective dopant placement.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is to obtain a Silicon Sublimation Cell that will evaporate silicon from an intrinsic silicon filament. The sublimation source is going to be used to investigate the initial stage of epitaxial growth on Phosphorus delta doped Si surface, where dedicated flux control and vapor purity become critical.</p>
<p>United Mineral and Chemical Corp is the sole reseller of this product. The reason is that the encapsulation must be done at low substrate temperatures to prevent P diffusion and maintain doping profile. The sublimation cell should have a silicon cell that can be heated by direct current to produce ultra-high purity silicon evaporation with minimum metallic contamination. The sublimation cell is required mainly because of their low deposition rate typically lower than 0.1 nm per minute which gives excellent flux control. Silicon purity is another critical factor in the application to meet the mission of fabricating atomic-scale device structures and the purity should of the highest possible level. This means that no other parts of the system that are being heated or ion/electron bombarded should be exposed directly to the deposition substrate during the process in order to avoid contaminations from other materials. Thus, evaporation cell must be high purity 'all-silicon' to avoid contamination. Therefore, no metal pieces that may be subject to high temperature or ion/electron beam bombardment will be exposed to the deposition target. There should be a cooling shroud around the sublimation cell in order to suppress heating of contact leads etc. Finally, using intrinsic silicon filament as ultra-pure silicon deposition source will require preheating mechanisms to preheat the filament for sublimation. MBE Company is the only manufacturer of SUSI in the world and United Mineral &amp; Chemical Corp is the sole distributor of the SUSI in North America</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515 and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern on November 14, 2017. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to support in vitro testing to assess the therapeutic potential of compounds to advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as advance the development of therapeutics for infectious diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>NIAID supports nearly all stages of the product development pipeline from in vitro therapeutic evaluation through advanced therapeutic and vaccine testing and manufacturing using multiple support services contracts. The current solicitation addresses a critical stage in this pipeline by providing an efficient means to assess the therapeutic potential of compounds through in vitro testing. The overarching goal of the In Vitro Assessments of Antimicrobial Activity program is to provide a broad and flexible range of in vitro assessment capabilities to the extramural research community to evaluate promising candidate countermeasures against the more than 270 pathogens, toxins, and vectors (PTVs) that are within the purview of DMID. In vitro assay capabilities include: product screening, assay development, and development of improved systems for culturing difficult to grow pathogens in vitro. These capabilities will allow the NIAID to respond to changing priorities as scientific and public health needs shift, including rapid responses to public health emergencies.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the needs of extramural researchers, it is anticipated that contracts resulting from this solicitation will provide crucial data that may be used by NIAID partners at other agencies in DHHS. Such data will facilitate the advancement of promising candidate medical countermeasures against priority bioterror agents to approval or licensure and, in some cases, eventual deposit in the Strategic National Stockpile.</p>
<p>As background, in 2011, 14 institutions were awarded base Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the In Vitro Assessments of Antimicrobial Activity program. For this recompetition, NIAID anticipates awarding multiple IDIQ contracts to organizations that have the capabilities required to fulfill the technical requirements of the Task Areas of this solicitation. Awards are anticipated on or about August 2018, and are expected to be comprised of a 7 year ordering period. Offerors will be considered for contracts only in the Task Area(s) included in their proposal. Sample Task Orders will be provided in the RFP for the purpose of evaluating Offeror responses and capabilities. A successful Contractor may compete for task orders only in the Task Area(s) in which they are selected for award. The Task Areas of this solicitation are as follows:</p>
<p>Task Area A - Bacteria, Fungi, and Toxins<br />Task Area B - Viruses<br />Task Area C - Parasites and Vectors <br />Task Area D - In Vitro Models that Mimic In vivo Exposures of Candidate Compounds<br />Task Area E - Development of New Techniques to Culture Difficult to Grow Pathogens</p>
<p>For the purposes of this solicitation the following definitions will apply:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Assays</em> - in vitro procedures for determining biological activity of a substance by measuring its effect on an organism, tissue, cell, enzyme or receptor preparation. In addition in vitro procedures for determining the concentration, and/or purity of a substance.<br />&bull; <em>Products</em> - broadly defined and include therapeutic substances targeting the host or the pathogen. <br />&bull; <em>Pathogens</em> - bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, particularly NIAID Category A, B and C list of Priority Pathogens (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens ) <br />&bull; <em>Toxins</em> - microbial toxins as they relate to human disease including toxins that are produced by NIAID Category A, B and C list of Priority Pathogens.<br />&bull; <em>Vectors</em> - arthropods (usually insects) or mollusks that carry pathogens from infected to uninfected hosts.<br />&bull; <em>Reagents</em> - biochemical, genomic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic materials integral to research on these pathogens, toxins and vectors.</p>
<p>The NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in the Statement of Work. Contractors may need to be supported to a certain extent by the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. However, contractors shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this procurement.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This is a pre-solicitation notice for a two-phase, competitive 8(a) Proposal (RFP) to Design and Construct a Fire Station at Clear AFS, AK (CLR043).  Response date of 29 December 2017 is based on issuance of the RFP on or about 29 November 2017.

<p>The procurement will be conducted using two-phase source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best overall value to the Government considering the non-price factors described in the RFP, and price. The Government will evaluate Phase 1 proposals in accordance with the evaluation rating systems outlined in the Phase 1 Design-Build selection procedures of the RFP. Those offerors short-listed in Phase 1 will be invited to submit a Phase 2 proposal. The Phase 2 evaluation will be conducted in accordance with evaluation criteria specified in the RFP for Phase 2, FAR Part 15, and will utilize the Tradeoff Process described in FAR 15.101-1.</p>

<p>All contractors are advised that they must be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/).  Joint ventures must also be registered in SAM as a joint venture.  We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>

The Government encourages respondents to leverage analysis and work conducted in the responses to the previous SBIRS Follow-on Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) RFI dated 7 May 2014, SBIRS Follow-on RFI dated 3 May 2016 and SBIRS Follow-on RFI #2 dated 22 Dec 2016. (Solicitation Number: SBIRSFO).</p>
<p>Space and Missile Systems Center/Remote Sensing (SMC/RS) Directorate has an unusual and compelling urgency to constitute a new highly resilient Space Warfighting Construct (SWC)-based five (5) Geosynchronous (GEO) + two (2) Polar Next Generation (Next Gen) architecture, in order to counter emerging threats while operating in a contested environment. To accelerate against emerging threats, the Air Force intends to procure Next Gen Block 0 which will constitute a SWC-based three (3) GEO + two (2) Polar Next Gen architecture operational by Fiscal Year (FY) 2029, with an initial launch capability (ILC) in FY2025. The Government anticipates a full and open competition for Next Gen Block 1, which may consist of at least two Capability Development Document (CDD) compliant Next Gen GEO satellites. Next Gen Block 1 is planned to start in the early to mid FY2020 with an ILC in FY2030 to complete the Next Gen five (5) GEO + two (2) polar Next Gen architecture.</p>
<p>The SWC-based Next Gen Missile Warning architecture requirements are documented in the Next Gen Block 0 draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and its classified annexes, which are derived from the draft SBIRS Follow-on CDD (dCDD) that was validated by the US Air Force in Feb 2017. The Next Gen Block 0 draft TRD requirements address specific target sets for detection and reporting and calls for a high degree of resiliency features in future satellites to increase strategic survivability in a contested environment.</p>
<p>SMC/RS is seeking sources capable of meeting the Government's unusual and compellingly urgent need. The Next Gen Missile Warning strategy may result in a new program focused on delivering the core Missile Warning (MW) capabilities. The core MW capabilities entail the strategic survivable next-generation layer of the architecture that will provide MW equal to or greater than today's SBIRS program of record. The core MW mission will perform boost phase missile warning for all classes of targets. Based on current market research, the Government has made a preliminary assessment that Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) is the only source capable of meeting the Government's Next Gen Block 0 requirements, without unacceptable schedule risks.</p>
<p>LMSSC is the current prime contractor for the legacy SBIRS Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) systems (SBIRS GEO-1 thru 6). LMSSC is also the only producer of the AF-validated nuclear hardened spacecraft that can meet the Government's strategically survivable requirements and our urgent need dates. Hence, the Government is considering soliciting and negotiating a sole source contract with LMSSC for Next Gen Block 0, which consists of three (3) Next Gen GEO satellites and two (2) Next Gen Polar free-flyer satellites, and their associated ground elements, pursuant to 10 USC &sect; 2304(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2.</p>
<p>The Government is also seeking information on interested payload vendors' capabilities to deliver a primary mission payload that meets the attached Next Gen Block 0 draft TRD requirements and schedule to support the GEO and Polar ILCs for architecture operational acceptance by FY2029. The Government is considering requiring the prime contractor to carry a minimum of two viable mission payload vendors at least through system a Critical Design Review (CDR) as part of the system development risk mitigation plan. The Government desires a light-weight resilient primary mission payload to maximize satellite resilience features (weight objective of less than 600 lbs). In order to field Next Gen resilient SVs as soon as possible, the Government is prioritizing schedule, satellite survivability/resilience features, integration into the SWC-enterprise, technical risk and meeting the core MW requirements as paramount. Launch of Next Gen satellites is to be limited to the medium Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) class, and the Government seeks to understand the degree to which auxiliary payloads and capabilities can be accommodated on the satellite.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) in the form of a briefing from sources interested and capable of: (1) performing as the prime contractor and satellite provider to deliver Next Gen satellites that have the required survivability/resilience features, are integrated into the SWC enterprise, meet the core MW requirements and achieve architecture operational acceptance by FY2029; and/or (2) performing as a contractor to design, build, and deliver a mission payload that meet the Government's requirements. Based on the Government's assessment, the need is to achieve first Next Gen SV ILC by FY2025. The Government is also seeking industry input on the Next Gen Block 0 draft TRD and other areas, including but not limited to, Government-mandated manufacturing, integration, and testing, that could be reasonably modified or eliminated with an appropriate level of risk that would impact schedule and cost.</p>
<p>The Next Gen Block 0 draft TRD will be made available upon request and will be provided to one person per company. The points of contact (POC) for both the CLASSIFIED and UNCLASSIFIED section can be found on section 9.2.</p>

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) <br />Customs &amp; Border Protection / U. S. Border Patrol<br />Laredo Sector Headquarters <br />Auto Parts Supply Concession <br />PR 20101810
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Laredo Sector would like to contract for a full service in house auto parts supply concession. This concession would supply a full range of auto parts supplies to support the sector's automotive parts needs for the Sector's Fleet vehicles. The concession would be fully staffed and operated by the vendor and have the capability to operate on a flexible schedule to accommodate the maintenance work flow. The concession must also have the ability to process purchases utilizing credit cards that are in use by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The concession will process all purchases on a monthly billing cycle with weekly financial reporting.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE</p>
<p>The intent of Laredo Sector is to establish an onsite service for the maintenance program to increase the efficiency and performance of the automotive maintenance program. The contract requirement is intended to support the Laredo Sector with a contract for a full service in-house auto parts supply concession within the Laredo Sector Headquarters Garage, to include remote-site (internet web-access) services to out-stations including Laredo West, Laredo South, Zapata, Freer, Hebbronville, and Cotulla. Laredo Sector also intends to purchase parts at the contract price from contractor's stores co-located in any of the out-stations. The services provided to out-stations would include, parts ordering capabilities and the supply of parts and part-ordering related technical advice as needed. The concession would supply a full range of auto parts supplies to support automotive and equipment part needs for fleet and all internal combustion engines equipped property serviced by the Laredo Sector Fleet garage personnel.</p>
<p>Currently, there is an automated method to connect the parts purchase for a vehicle through CBP's financial software system (i.e. SAP). Establishing an on-site auto parts concession will allow the Government to utilize the individual fleet credit cards to make part purchases for the vehicles, and the maintenance charges for those vehicles to be directly reflected in SAP through the credit card purchases. Establishing an on-site auto parts concession utilizing the Vehicle Management Information System (VMIS) will allow the Sector Fleet Operations Branch's to account and track the maintenance charges.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR<br />A CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES CONTRACT <br />FOR THE BUILDING 245 RADIATION PHYSICS MODERNIZATION PROJECT AT <br />NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS &amp; TECHNOLOGY<br />GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND
<p><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine interest and availability and socioeconomic status (e.g. Large or Small Business - 8(a), Service-disabled Veteran owned small business, HUB Zone small business, and Women owned small business, etc.) of companies for a future specialized construction project at the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology, in Gaithersburg, MD. The government is seeking companies under either NAICS Code 236220 that have the capability, experience and expert knowledge to provide comprehensive construction management professional services for Building 245 Radiation Physics Facility Modernization project described herein. The government contemplates a single award task order for a construction management services contract in the amount of $20M - $35M aggregate.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Gaithersburg, Maryland campus is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) facility with 52 buildings located on a 574-acre site. NIST develops, maintains and disseminates the measurement standards for electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity in the United States. The work in the Radiation Physics Building (Building 245) currently supports industry through research, the realization and dissemination of the International System of Units (SI) derived standards for radiation dose (Gray, Gy) and radioactivity (becquerel, Bq), including for health, environmental, security, and manufacturing applications, and traceability to the SI (watt, W) for electromagnetic radiation in the visible, UV, and soft x-ray regimes. NIST also provides user facilities for radiometry measurements for other federal agencies and industrial partners. Calibration services and transfer standards for electromagnetic radiation provide critical traceability chains to NIST standards for secondary calibration labs serving customers in the medical, scientific, and industrial sectors. Research is ongoing to pursue advances in many aspects of metrology including those related to nuclear medicine, environmental radioactivity, medical imaging, advanced manufacturing, homeland security, and regulatory requirements for environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Completed in 1964, Building 245 totals 208,000 gross sq. feet and was the first research facility built on the NIST Gaithersburg Campus. Purpose-built to accommodate the nation's radiation physics research, this is a highly-specialized facility with concrete shield walls nearly 10 feet thick and large subterranean program areas located in basement and sub-basement levels.

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /><br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and&nbsp; (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice<strong>.<br /><br />Background<br /><br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases<strong>.<br /></strong><br />NIAID has made a significant investment in funding basic and clinical research projects that are generating large, diverse and complex data sets including genomics/omics data, clinical data, immune phenotyping assay data, imaging and other data sets. The infectious disease and immune mediated disease communities have become a data-intense enterprise and a priority for NIAID is to transform this data into knowledge to understand the pathogenesis, transmission, evolution of the pathogen, pathogen-host interactions and the host response to infectious diseases and inform the development of new and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. NIAID has invested in bioinformatics and data science for data generated by NIAID intramural and extramural communities and has expanded its activities in data management systems, bioinformatics resource centers and data repositories that have provided the broad scientific community with user friendly interfaces for public access to data and analytic tools. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /><br /></strong>Since their inception in 2004, NIAID's Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) have focused on supporting and providing genome sequence databases and annotation of microbial organisms. These BRCs have provided the infectious disease research community with publicly accessible systems that store, update, integrate and display genome sequence data and its annotation, functional genomics and other "omics" data, and other associated data and information for a large variety of human pathogens and vectors of human pathogens and related microbial species and strains. The BRC systems allow users to query and analyze this data. As a result, the BRCs have become the public repository and primary resource for data and tools generated by NIAID supported programs and other publicly accessible data for the infectious disease research community.<br /><br />The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to maintain BRCs, which have become a critical resource for data and tools generated by NIAID supported programs and other public data for the infectious disease research community.<br /><br />The scope of this anticipated solicitation is to provide bioinformatics resources and services for the infectious disease community.
<p><strong><br />Project Requirements<br /><br /></strong>The proposed BRCs will provide the following:<br /><br />&bull; Data-driven production-level sustainable computational platform(s) that enable sharing and access to usable data, portable computational tools, and standards that support interoperability. <br /><br />&bull; Expertise in infectious diseases with bioinformatics services and training to support large-scale, system level diverse data integration and modeling, to support predictive biology for pathogens and host-pathogen interactions that will accelerate discovery research, clinical investigation, and therapeutic development for infectious diseases. <br /><br />&bull; A bioinformatics platform that is expected to serve as a model for future NIAID systems.</p>
<p>Two centers are planned, one for bacterial species and viral families and one for protozoan species, fungi and invertebrate vectors of human pathogens. Offerors may propose to one or both data resources for the group of organisms.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /><br /></strong>It is anticipated that two (2) cost-reimbursement, level-of-effort, type contracts will be awarded with a one-year base period of performance beginning on or around June 1, 2019. Awards are expected to include four (4) one-year option periods. Total anticipated period of performance, if all term-options are exercised, shall be June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2024. The Government's base level-of-effort requirement is estimated at 43,680 direct labor hours for each contract year, equating to 21 full time equivalents (FTE's) with an FTE being defined as 2,080 direct labor hours. In addition to the base level-of-effort, each year of performance is anticipated to contain an option quantity for up to nine (9) additional FTEs. <br /><strong><br />Other Important Considerations</strong></p>

<DESC>Responses to Sources Sought Notice #9095


Question # 7:Â  General Pricing.Â  Do you want general pricing for all of the items being sought or just a few at random general prices from the list?

The vendor should submit pricing for all items they can provide. 


Question: Not all of the items on the solicitation we can provide but the general information on the sonication is to use multiple vendors, how do you want us to indicate items we cannot provide?

For items the vendor cannot supply they should mark  N/A .


Question:Â  As this is a four year agreement with some items being proprietary, how do you allow for increases on certain products prices that the manufacture may increase prices significantly over the next four years?

The vendor should provide pricing for all items they can supply for every year (Base Year + Four Additional Option Years) to include inflation and changes in manufacturing pricing.Â  As such, if option years are exercised, pricing will be reviewed to determine if it is fair and reasonable.

<DESC>RFI, Version 6.0, 14 Nov 2017
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS

Description
1.1 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in support of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking information from interested contractors to provide continued assistance in developing and designing marketing and advertising strategies for the implementation and maintenance of recruitment and retention programs for a variety of hard-to-fill healthcare professional and technical positions.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes   it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the VA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
Background
The expanding shortages in physician specialties, nursing, pharmacy and other occupations, coupled with an aging work force, make it imperative that VHA maintain a first-class, competitive recruitment and retention program. As VA continues to expand managed care and primary care, the need has shifted to physicians who are generalists and the mid-level practitioners who support the delivery of care that promotes health and prevents disease, supported by a highly competent tertiary underpinning. Many critical health care occupations within VHA are predominately staffed by a cohort of employees at or near retirement age. The shortage of new professionals entering the workforce in many of these occupations is stimulating intense recruitment competition. Effective marketing efforts, including recruitment advertising in existing and developing media will be a key element in efforts to achieve the approximate mix of healthcare provided to support the change from inpatient to outpatient care. To achieve these recruitment objectives, the VA uses USAJobs and USA Staffing for processing job applicants. Because the VA currently is not able to place a tracking pixel or cookies on either the USAJobs or USA Staffing websites, collection of critical tracking and related application data remains a challenge.
Scope of Work
Contractor shall manage and oversee the VA s nationwide recruitment, marketing and advertisement for critical medical occupations and associated technical support personnel. Contractor assess the return on investment (ROI), effectiveness, and performance of the recruitment, marketing and advertising campaign using industry standard best practices and a comprehensive metrics/analytics tools and techniques.
Q1. Describe your firms demonstrated experience with managing nationwide healthcare recruitment programs as well as marketing and advertisement for major recruitment initiatives. Provide, at a minimum three (3) and a maximum of five (5) instances of comparable scope and complexity.  For each instance, include the following: 
A narrative case study that describes the details of each project and why it is relevant to this requirement, including difficulties and successes.
Describe your Self-Performed* effort (as a Prime) as it relates to the requirements in the scope section of this RFI.     
Be specific and provide a complete reference to include, at a minimum the project name (and the government contract number, if applicable), contract award amount, start and completion dates, scope of work, type of media purchased, amount of media purchased by dollar. 
Additionally, provide the Contract Type: Firm Fixed-Price, Time and Material, etc.

*Self-Performed means work performed by the company themselves, NOT work performed by another company for them for any of the project examples provided.

Contractor shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining an integrated, coherent, recruitment marketing campaign. This includes creating and developing themes, concepts, strategies, and promotional items to maximize VA exposure and foster a positive awareness of VA in the minds of the targeted audience. The contractor will design material such as ads, videos, Public Service Announcements (PSAs), and brochures that promotes VA as an employer of choice. Contractor will design strategies to encourage the targeted group to apply for, and accept, employment with VA and to encourage retention. The effort is a year-round, programmed approach that must be responsive to changing priorities and shifting staffing requirements. The contractor must be immediately available and flexible enough to meet short deadlines (24hr) that may arise from the VA mission requirements.

Contractor shall integrate VA Recruitment websites with the Choose VA website (https://www.choose.va.gov/).  Contractor will integrate all components of the Choose VA website that promotes the VA as an employer of choice.
Target audience is health care professionals and associated technical support personnel. Coverage may be expanded to include other occupations as the needs of VA require.
Q6. Describe your firm s experience with recruitment of health care, allied health professionals, and associated technical support professionals.
Target area is nationwide; however, VA needs will also require streamlined approaches on a regional, statewide, or local level as demands arise. 
Q7. What marketing and promotional strategies are recommended for satisfying the VA s recruitment efforts at national, state and local levels?
When feasible, each advertisement must reflect, and contain, a specific reference to VA's policy for providing equal employment opportunity without regard to non-merit factors (race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or handicap). All advertising material must be supported by the facts. All materials developed either print or electronic must comply with governmental and VA policy regarding accessibility and privacy.

The VA New Jersey Healthcare System (NJHCS) has a requirement for an organization to consult, evaluate and develop a certification program based on the Planetree model in patient and person-centered care across the continuum of healthcare. The certification sought shall be universally recognized for the kind of structured, standards-based quality improvement framework that a healthcare program provides. A person-centered culture is not built solely around the patient experience and their needs and preferences, but must also address the experiences and needs of family members, as well as the healthcare professionals.  Certification must be recognized by the Joint Commission and represent the highest level of achievement in patient/person-centered care based on key elements necessary to implement and sustain organizational cultures; establish person-centered excellence as a definable goal that can be set, tracked and achieved; provide a concrete framework for implementation; and provide external validation and recognition that differentiates healthcare organizations demonstrating superior levels of achievement in patient/person-centered care.
 
The Planetree model for Patient/Person-Centered Certification builds upon a tiered system of recognition:
Bronze for Meaningful Progress in Patient/Person Centered Care
Silver for Significant Advancement in Patient/Person Centered Care
Gold for Excellence In Person Centered Care 

In 2017, the NJHCS was awarded Silver Recognition for Significant Advancement in Patient/Person-Centered Care for the continuing care environment. They are now seeking to attain the third tier recognition of Gold for Excellence in Person Centered Care of the Planetree model.

The performance period shall be for a base period with the possibility of four (4) option periods.  Services are needed to commence on or about January 1, 2018, and the procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

This solicitation package may be available on or about December 19, 2017.

Response to this announcement shall determine if sufficient competition exists to set aside the procurement for Service Disabled Veteran Operated Small Business, Small Veteran Owned Business, or Small Business.  Please provide interest in this solicitation by November 28, 2017, indicating business size and other pertinent information about your business.  You may contact me via e-mail at Michelle.Harsch@va.gov , or by fax to my attention at 716-684-0474.  Telephone replies will not be honored.

<SOLNBR>NNA17BF41C-MOD-20171114
<RESPDATE>112817
<CONTACT>Umetria T. Dickson, Contracting Officer, Email u.t.dickson@nasa.gov
<DESC><p>NASA/ARC intends to modify Contract NNA17BF41C, titled Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator (PTD) with Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. on a sole- source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. PTD supports spaceflight missions, which are managed by the Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP) Level II office located at Ames Research Center. The PTD Project was awarded for the development, integration and delivery of one 6U nano-satellite spacecraft plus five spare (optional) spacecraft. PTD will test the operation of a variety of novel satellite technologies in low Earth orbit, providing significant enhancements to the performance of these small and effective spacecraft. The current scope of work includes primary ground station support and spacecraft operations support. Under the proposed modification, the scope of work and value of the contract will increase to include of mission operations support and additional options for payload assessment activities. The proposed changes are determined to be in-scope of the original work requirements.</p>
<p>The proposed changes will require Contractor to:<br />&bull; provide a ground data system (GDS) solution that is compatible with the awarded spacecraft communication system.<br />&bull; become the lead for the pre-flight performance testing and flight operations.<br />&bull; perform mission operations, engineering support, mission planning, crew console training, flight product generation, and real-time operations as needed to characterize integrated payload. <br />&bull; provide any necessary mission control facilities, GDS integration, command load simulations and verification, on-console flight support, on-orbit bus and payload calibration, on-orbit bus and payload checkout, on-orbit payload characterization, fault management and anomaly resolution. Operations coverage shall cover launch through end-of-mission decommissioning. Payload telemetry and supporting bus H&amp;S telemetry shall be made remotely accessible to NASA and/or the Payload PI as soon as it is received and processed on the ground.</p>
<p>Additionally, the number payload assessment options will also increase by three (3). The original contract award included the option for five flight integration assessments. As part of the assessment, the contractor performs a technical assessment of the required spacecraft modifications (if any) to accommodate a NASA provided payload.</p>
<p>This modification will not extend the period of performance of the current contract. The current contractor, is considered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs. As the satellite provider and developer, they possess proprietary knowledge of the operation and nominal performance of their satellite bus. This knowledge is a key to the objective and success of PTD Project and is listed as a requirement of the Project. Off nominal flight conditions as well as fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) by the mission operations team can only be accomplished with the proprietary knowledge of the spacecraft. The requisite knowledge and spacecraft characterization is possessed only by the satellite developer. Awarding a separate contract to another source would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the point of contact identified below not later than 1 PM PST on November 28, 2017. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regarding this notice should also be directed to the identified point of contact no later than 1pm PST on November 21, 2017.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION&nbsp;(RFI)</p>
<p>1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information and&nbsp;industry comments in anticipation of a future competitive solicitation for the Consolidated Product-Line Management (CPM) Plus program.<br /><br />2.0 Introduction<br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) is performing research to gather information from interested sources for a new contract supporting the current and future objectives of the CPM Plus program. The Live Training Transformation (LT2) CPM Plus approach focuses on the requirements, development, execution, management, and synchronization of the LT2 Product-Line (P/L).<br /><br />2.1 Program Background<br />In 2001, PEO STRI put the LT2 P/L strategy in place. Today, through use of the CPM Next contract, PM TRADE builds and maintains the LT2 P/L systems in support of home station training, deployed training, urban operations training, combat training centers training, and instrumented live-fire range training. The LT2 P/L provides state-of-the-art training systems to the warfighter utilizing 186 common reusable components and service-oriented architecture services, architectural infrastructure, interfaces, standards, processes, and information technology assets.<br /><br />With 21 LT2 products fielded to over 200 sites globally, the LT2 P/L successfully employs technical and acquisition strategies that significantly reduce fielding time, minimize acquisition costs, enable total ownership cost reductions, and enhance training benefits afforded to the warfighter.<br /><br />The incumbent contractor for the existing CPM Next effort under contract number W900KK-15-D-0003 is General Dynamics Mission Systems, Inc., 12001 Research Parkway Ste 500, Orlando, FL 32826-3249.<br /><br />2.2 Program Description<br />The CPM Plus contract will continue to manage the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L. The CPM Plus contract will continue to meet the requirements for a consolidated streamlined approach that:<br /><br />1) Protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment.<br /><br />2) Continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LT2 P/L Construct.<br /><br />3) Continues to provide PM TRADE with efficient, effective, and agile methods to deliver military training products.<br /><br />CPM Plus is the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a system's life cycle within a System-of-Systems (SoS) environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based. CPM Plus will continue to evolve the deliberate processes for managing the development, production, and sustainment of LT2 products. CPM Plus will enable using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.<br /><br />The anticipated nature and complexity of the LT2 P/L work tasks (ranging from P/L architectural development, system development, SoS management to P/L core asset variability, and configuration management) associated with CPM Plus requires mature and established processes, and therefore at least a level 3 CMMI company rating.<br /><br />2.3 Program Schedule<br />Listed below is the anticipated acquisition milestone timeline for the CPM Plus acquisition. The milestones are "draft" only and are subject to change.<br /><br />1) RFI Responses Due: 4:00 PM EST, 15 December 2017<br /><br />2) PALT Initiation: 2nd Qtr FY18<br /><br />3) RFP Release: 3rd Qtr FY18<br /><br />4) Contract Award: 2nd Qtr FY20<br /><br />3.0 Responses<br />The Government is conducting market research with companies that are interested in this requirement. Specifically the Government requests that companies address the following topics within the context of the LT2 P/L domain.<br /><br />1) Intelligent Data Analytics<br />a. Real time data logging, analysis of system performance<br />b. Machine learning, predictive models of system performance in operational environment<br /><br />2) User Training &amp; Content Delivery<br />a. Intelligent agent tutoring<br />b. Quick access to content (Wiki, Ref Guide, FAQ) (cloud-enabled)<br />c. Accessible from smart mobile devices (hardware agnostic)<br /><br />3) Systematic Quality<br />a. Quality of service metrics and automated feedback<br />b. Automated review of product line processes and assets<br />c. Process and standards enforcement<br /><br />4) Training &amp; Technology Agility<br />a. Embedded training/training at the point of need<br />b. Integrated training environment (expand live external interfaces to support multi domain systems)<br />c. Support of multiple simultaneous exercises (micro services)<br />d. Objective training assessment data/metrics<br /><br />5) Seamless LT2 Product<br />a. Alignment of software and hardware product line, and total system life cycle support<br />b. Scalability<br /><br />All strategies should strive to protect and leverage the Army's LT2 P/L investment, while evolving core assets and the LT2 Construct tools and processes to ensure technology relevance across the P/L.<br /><br />A web-based portal hosts a reference library and contains a multitude of information related to PM TRADE LT2 and CPM efforts. The library is located at https://lt2portal.mil. If you do not already have a LT2 Portal account then please go to the site and register for an account (click on register on top right hand side of the LT2 Portal home page, then fill in the information requested).

13.Description of work: 

The Advanced Research Projects Agency â€“ Energy (â€œARPA-E â€œor â€œAgencyâ€) is a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy (â€œDOEâ€).  The mission of ARPA-E is to overcome the long-term and high-risk barriers in the development of energy technologies.  ARPA-E facilitates, creates, manages and catalyzes accelerated transformational energy research and development (â€œR&Dâ€) programs and projects to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that reduce energy imports, improve energy efficiency and reduce energy-related emissions.  The goals of ARPA-E, as established by the America Competes Act of 2007, are generally to: (1) enhance American economic security by identifying technologies with the potential to reduce energy imports from foreign sources; (2) reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and improve efficiency across the energy spectrum; and (3) ensure the United States of America remains a technological leader in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.
ARPA-Eâ€™s mission is highly dependent on intellectual property matters, including acquiring necessary intellectual property rights for government purposes, supporting commercialization of technologies resulting from ARPA-E awards, ensuring US manufacturing requirements, and defending government intellectual property rights in disputes and litigation.  

In providing intellectual property services, the Contractor will apply its expertise and experience as follows under collaborative guidance and monitoring of the ARPA-E Chief Counsel (â€œChief Counselâ€) and the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property (â€œDOE Assistant General Counselâ€): 

-The Contractor will support the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel to identify, assess, and resolve complex intellectual property issues. The Contractor will advise on intellectual property matters and provide senior experience to support ARPA-E Funding Opportunity Announcements and resulting award negotiations; address complicated technology commercialization issues, and any necessary ARPA-E policy changes. The Contractor will draft documents and provide other assistance to ARPA-E in the field of Intellectual Property, including the crafting of ARPA-E policies, standard contract clauses, preparing presentations, and participating in meetings with staff at ARPA-E.  

-At the discretion of Chief Counsel, the Contractor may be asked to review and provide recommendations, such as special intellectual property provisions with respect to proposed new solicitations and sole source awards.  

-At the direction of the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will mentor less experienced intellectual property attorneys in the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel who support ARPA-E.

-In accordance with relevant ARPA-E policies and procedures, and using material approved by ARPA-E, the Contractor will provide awardees who have been selected to receive awards from ARPA-E with proposed Intellectual Property terms and conditions. The Contractor will interact with proposed awardees with regard to their intellectual property concerns.

-The Contractor will assist the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, and their legal staffs, as they provide legal advice to ARPA-E legal and the ARPA-E contracting staff of awardee concerns with respect to those proposed provisions.  

-During the term of ARPA-E awards, the Contractor will assist ARPA-E legal and contracting and the DOE Assistant General Counsel in the administration of ARPA-E awards.  This may include facilitating the reporting of inventions, the submission of periodic and final technical reports and the close out of awards.  It may also include assisting the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, in the review and comment on Intellectual Property and Data Management Plans and Subject Invention Utilization reports. 

-The Contractor will also monitor developments in the field of intellectual property law with particular attention to developments related to the activities of the Federal Government such as the awarding of agreements for the performance of research and development.  The Contractor will work directly with the DOE Assistant General Counsel to keep informed on current DOE policies and procedures with respect to intellectual property, such as the awarding and administration of agreements, reporting of awardee inventions, government employee inventions, maintenance of award and invention records, disposition of intellectual property rights, and the treatment of infringement claims. The Contractor will keep the Chief Counsel apprised of such developments that affect ARPA-E.  

-At the request of the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will assess, and recommend strategies to respond to unusual intellectual property situations.

-The Contractor will perform other services related to intellectual property as requested by the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel.

The access on the right side has a 14 foot long horizontal lateral gallery running upstream at the bottom of the vertical shaft to the spillway compartments entry. There is also a 3'X4' opening in each one of the 11 spillway piers. A site has been identified for disposal of the material</p>

The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees.  If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. (d)  The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator means a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity to establish additional System for Award Management (SAM) records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator (if applicable), the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>Unique entity identifier means a number or other identifier used to identify a specific commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity. See www.sam.gov for the designated entity for establishing unique entity identifiers.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>

<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies.

<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, November 21, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC><br />******PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER W91236-17-R-0022*****<br /><br /><br />1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
<p>The work consists of raising the soil dikes surrounding and crossing the Craney Island Dredged Material Management Area (CIDMMA) a few feet at a time. This work shall be performed by earth moving, hauling and placement equipment with all work contained within the CIDMMA boundaries. Dredge materials stored in the two borrow sites shall be excavated and then transported to dike raising locations as specified in contract plans and then placed and compacted. The Contractor is responsible for the completion of both the Before Dike (BD) and After Dike (AD) surveys and associated documentation for planning, progress billings, and final as-built drawings. If all anticipated funding is awarded, approximately 1,023,000 cubic yards of dredge material shall be transported and placed onto the dikes. The dike raising includes two to four feet of compacted fill placed across all dikes' top surfaces and partially down each of the dike's side slopes. The contract includes grubbing and clearing before dike material placement; and hydroseeding after dike placement. This is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract where the specific work areas and scope shall be defined using Task Orders based on unit costs included in the Contractor's cost proposal.</p>
<p>The IDIQ contract will include a one year Base Contract with two Option Years.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of EM 385-1-1. If the Contractor is a currently accepted participant in the Dredging Contractors of America (DCA)/United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Dredging Safety Management Program (DSMP), as determined by the DCA/USACE Joint Committee, and holds a current valid Certificate of Compliance for both the Contractor Program and the Dredge(s) to be used to perform the work under this contract, the Contractor may, in lieu of the submission of an Accident Prevention Plan (APP),</p>

<p>c. Coordination with Other Contractors<br />During the period of this contract, other contracts and USACE personnel may be in force for the construction of other features of work on or adjacent to the site of work being accomplished under this contract and for usage of the dike haul roads. The Contractor shall arrange his plant, and shall schedule and perform this work, so as to effectively cooperate with all other contractors and Government agencies. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor on this contract to be fully informed of the extent of the limits of work to be performed by other contractors and USACE workers.

<p><br />6. AWARD TO RESPONSIBLE OFFEROR</p>
<p>DEFINITIVE RESPONSIBILITY CRITERIA <br />In addition to examining the criteria in FAR 9.104.-1, the Contracting Officer will also examine whether the low bidder can meet the requirements of three definitive responsibility criteria.

<p>Bidders can use one or more projects per work component, above, to demonstrate past experience. Each work component must be addressed. If a subcontractor is used to complete a work component, that subcontractor must demonstrate his past experience in that work component. The Contracting Officer will verify that the submitted projects meet the definitive responsibility criteria as part of the responsibility determination. Bidders are not required to submit additional documentation related to these criteria at the time of bid. The Government will request supporting documentation from the bidder anticipated to receive the award.</p>
<p>In addition to the definitive responsibility criteria stated above, a bidder must demonstrate -<br />a) Adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them; <br />b) Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments; <br />c) A satisfactory performance record. A prospective contractor shall not be determined responsible or non-responsible solely on the basis of a lack of relevant performance history; <br />d) A satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and<br />e) Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 9.1, responsibility will be determined, prior to award, by the Contracting Officer through the performance of a pre-award survey or utilizing information from a previous pre-award survey and/or any performance data available. The apparent low bidder is required to demonstrate the experience as outlined in the definitive criteria above and may be required to show the firm has the necessary capital, experience, and owns or can procure the necessary plant or other resources to commence the work at the time prescribed in the specifications and thereafter to prosecute and complete the work safely and satisfactorily within the time specified.

Failure to submit with the offer satisfactory evidence of the authority of all other persons may be cause for rejection of the offer as invalid or nonresponsive.</p>
<p><br />8. PREAWARD SAFETY CONFERENCE</p>
<p>a. Where an apparent low bidder, in performance of contracts during the previous three-year period, incurred one or more accidents, or where, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, there is any question regarding this compliance with any safety or accident prevention requirement, such bidder, on request of the Contracting Officer prior to any award under this solicitation, shall attend a conference with representatives of the Contracting Officer to discuss any such accidents or non-compliance, the reason for their occurrence, and measures which will be taken to preclude any recurrence thereof.</p>
<p>b. Information elicited at this conference will be used by the Contracting Officer, in conjunction with other information obtained in a preaward survey, in determining the bidder's responsibility.</p>
<p>c. The items discussed, the preventive measures considered, and any conclusions reached in this conference shall be recorded in minutes of the meeting, which shall be authenticated by the signatures of representatives of the bidder and the Contracting Officer, and any procedures noted therein as agreed upon shall become an obligation of the bidder, along with all other safety and accident prevention requirements of the contract, if award is made to him.</p>
<p>9. INCURRING COSTS</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(c)
(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention toâ€”

The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished.
(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.<BR><BR>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is â€œlateâ€ and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; andâ€”
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governmentâ€™s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<BR><BR>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerorâ€™s initial offer should contain the offerorâ€™s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.
(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governmentâ€™s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business dayâ€™s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractorâ€™s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that exceed the micro-purchase threshold.<BR><BR>(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term â€œEFTâ€ refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to eitherâ€”
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractorâ€™s EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractorâ€™s EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible forâ€”
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractorâ€™s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, andâ€”

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractorâ€™s financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing.

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an â€œI agreeâ€ click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., â€œclick-wrapâ€ or â€œbrowse-wrapâ€ agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officerâ€™s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractorâ€™s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

                    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractorâ€™s network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractorâ€™s ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.

When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
 
      (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.

      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD.

            (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
 
            (5)  To a support services contractor (â€œrecipientâ€) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
 
      (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD.

      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractorâ€™s responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shallâ€”
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties.

<DESC>Operations Division, Navigation Management Branch is requesting the SV GEORGIA - starboard main propulsion diesel engine service by an authorized Detroit Diesel Marine Dealer/Mechanic.
<p>This is a Full and Open Procurement.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Point of Contact (POC): (Invoices/Access/Technical)</p>
<p>Jim Bodenrader: (912) 652-6112 James.A.Bodenrader@usace.army.mil<br />Cone Bostwick/COR: (912) 210-3580 Cone.S.Bostwick@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>2. Location: The SV Georgia is located at the USACE Savannah District Depot on Hutchinson Island. The physical address is 99 Grand Prize of America Savannah, Ga. 31421.The contractor will be required to perform the service at this location during USACE working hours, Mon-Fri; 0630-1500. <br /><br />3. Background: SV Georgia- The starboard main propulsion diesel engine was noted to have bubbles in the overflow tank for the cooling jacket water system. Further testing revealed the cooling jacket water system pressure in excess of 14 PSI, while noting significant pressure increases with increased throttle. Normal system configuration utilizes a 7 PSI vent/vacuum cap. Suspect combustion gas/pressure is entering cooling jacket water. Contractor will inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations for cause, and repair/rebuild.</p>
<p>4. Period of Performance: The estimated time for completion is within 28 calendar days after award date of contract. ** Coordination for access and initiation of work should be completed between the contractor and the POCs listed above with 5 calendar days after award date. **</p>
<p>5. Requirements: Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations. A modification to the contract may be issued based on the results of the findings, recommendations of the contractor, and approval of USACE.</p>
<p>a. Task 1: Inspect, diagnose, and provide repair recommendations</p>
<p>6. Engine Information: <br />SV Georgia <br />a. Component ID: 06R DETROIT SERIES 60 (STBD)<br />b. Component Type: DIESEL ENGINE<br />c. Manufacturer: MTU<br />d. Model: SERIES 60<br />e. Port Engine Serial Number: 06R0767461<br />f. Application: MARINE</p>
<p>As this is intended as a diagnose and repair service contract it is incumbent of the contractor to address any discovery of other mechanical issues that will need to be addressed, which would prevent a successful test run, in order to return the SV Georgia back into service. USACE may modify the existing contract or issue a new separate contract solicitation to correct any discovered deficiencies or mechanical issues.</p>

<DESC><strong>Please see more detailed information regarding sessions.</strong> <br /><br /><em>1. FCC typically schedules 12-16 per truck to be completed in a 7 hour period. If there are delays at entry or issues with the truck - less scans are performed. <br /><br />2. FCC had 7 trucks scheduled from Dec 2016 - Nov 2017. A total of 64 visits (inmates) were completed with an estimated 85 procedures/scans total. There were issues with truck delays and breakdowns this year which has decreased the number of MRIs able to be completed.</em>

Additional awards for the same item or items may be made to <br />offeror(s) representing the next best value(s). Award(s) will be made in the combination that will <br />assure the Government needs in terms of delivery, quality, and price will be met during the life of <br />the contract(s). However, the government will award no more than 2 contracts per NSN or CLIN groups <br />as a result of the solicitation.</p>
<p>( ) Single or Split Awards: The award of each individual item of supply specified in this <br />solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government. In making the best value determination, the Government will make a comparative assessment of the offerors.</p>
<p>All proposals will be evaluated to determine that the offered price(s) reflects a technical understanding of the requirement and those considered unrealistic may be rejected.<br />Evaluation Factors:<br />The Government will base the determination of best value on a comparative assessment of the <br />offeror's prices, past performance, and other evaluation factors as identified in this <br />solicitation. The determination of best value also considers the relative importance of the evaluation factors. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are:<br />( x ) approximately equal to price; or<br />( ) significantly less important than price. As the evaluated price becomes more equal, relative importance of all other evaluation factors become more significant.<br />( ) significantly more important than price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the <br />evaluated price becomes more important.<br />The final award decision may be made through a trade-off between price and the non-price factors.<br />The following factors, ranked in descending order of importance, will be considered in the <br />evaluation of proposals received under this solicitation:<br />1. Price<br />2. Past Performance<br />3. Proposed Delivery<br />4. Surge and Sustainment<br />5. Socioeconomic Support</p>

Unless cited <br />elsewhere in this solicitation, the testing cost is shown below:<br />Item Government testing cost NSN 1005-00-572-3205 $11,009.63</p>
<p>Evaluation of Offers - Contractor First Article Testing<br />The cost offered by the contractor for performing the contractor first article testing shall be a <br />factor in evaluating offers. The contractor's testing cost will be added to the total offered price <br />of the applicable item. The Government will also evaluate the reasonableness of offered prices.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />Past performance includes but is not limited to, the offeror's record of conforming to <br />specifications, to the standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract schedules, commitment <br />to customer satisfaction, and cooperative behavior.

<p>The Government may solicit information from an offeror's customers and business associates; <br />federal, state, and local government agencies; and from other persons and organizations as deemed <br />necessary. The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it decides to query <br />and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>

Evaluation of PPIRS-SR delivery <br />assessments will be based upon a numerical scale ranging from 0 (low) to 100 (high). If no delivery <br />records are found in PPIRS-SR, no delivery score will be assigned to the offeror for that specific <br />FSC. Quality performance will be assessed based upon relative ranking among all offerors within a <br />given FSC.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on <br />past performance is not available in the PPIRS-SR, the offeror will be evaluated neither favorably <br />nor unfavorably on past performance.</p>

<DESC><div>The General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in gaining feedback from its industry and Government partners regarding the proposed changes to the Software SINs. Please see the attached file to view the proposed changes and specific questions. The deadline for RFI responses has been extended to December 12, 2017 at 3PM.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) on the IT Schedule 70 contract vehicle that define software use rights and mutual obligations have not been updated in more than ten years.<br /><br />In recent years, industry&rsquo;s software delivery models and the Federal Government&rsquo;s software needs have evolved. This proposed update to the Software SINs seeks to capture these changes and refine the mutual rights and obligations between Federal Government software buyers and software providers.</div>
<div>The proposed changes are:</div>
<div>&#9679; Redefinition of SIN 132-32 Term Software Licenses,</div>
<div>&#9679; Optional Rights under SIN 132-33 Perpetual Software Licenses,</div>
<div>&#9679; Replacement of SIN 132-34 Software Maintenance as a Service with Software Maintenance as a Product</div>
<div>&#9679; Utilization Limitations Under SINs 132-32, 132-33, 132-34</div>
<div>&#9679; Commercial Supplier Agreements (CSA&rsquo;s) are defined to include Enterprise User License Agreements (EULA&rsquo;s), Terms of Service Agreements (TOS&rsquo;s) and other licensing agreements.</div>
<div>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RFI HIGHLIGHTS THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO BOTH THE SOLICITATION AND THE CRITICAL INFORMATION ADDENDUM TO THE SOLICITATION AS THEY RELATE TO SOFTWARE ONLY.</div>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE<br />This announcement is for information purposes only.
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) proposes to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract using Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, and Labor Hour type delivery orders to support the creation, conflation, integration and enrichment of Foundation GEOINT data to produce a comprehensive, worldwide, authoritative, seamless dataset using traditional and non-traditional data sources. Also, to provide NGA with continuously enriched topographic and human geography data along with the capability to deliver Geography finished products.</p>
<p>The total anticipated period of performance is a 5-year base ordering period with a 5-year optional ordering period. This procurement will be posted for full and open competition and will not be set-aside for small business. The applicable NAICS Code is 541370, and the size standard is $15M.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Previous draft version of the Statement of Work (issued with Request for Information) included the requirement for Aero Feature Data (i.e. Airfield Foundation Data (AFD) and Vertical Obstructions (VO)).

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA262-17-AP-11257
1A. PROJECT/TASK No. NONE
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$35,871.81
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Contractor shall provide maintenance, labor, material, supervision and travel on six (6) emergency generators located in the Facilities Management Service (FMS) basement (1), behind FMS (4), and in the Outpatient Pharmacy (1), for the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS), 11201 Benton Street, Loma Linda, CA  92357. 

Additionally, to maintain emergency power protection to VALLHS, rental generators shall be provided during servicing. Power generation shall meet or exceed three (3) Mega Watts.

The period of performance shall be one year.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The generators need to be available in the event of commercial power failure, to support the building load in maintaining, life support systems, air handlers, boilers, IT infrastructure and clinics. This emergency procurement of broken generators must get repaired to stop the delay in patient treatment especially for life support systems.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

All the current emergency generators are broken. Veteran Electrical Power Systems, a Serviced Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) is a local business that has been used in the past and can fix them in a hurry. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to utilized the current contractor to avoid the risk of losing, life support systems, air handlers, boilers, IT infrastructure and clinics.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was not conducted as this is a safety issue and must be completed quickly to avoid patients, visitors and employees getting hurt due to equipment failure.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
