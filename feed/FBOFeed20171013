Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

This notice is to inform potential contractors bidding on the HEGM acquisition that this acquisition will include classified data. The classified data will only be given to potential contractors with a confirmed "need to know" during the formal RFP phase, not the draft RFP phase.</p>
<p>Contractors who want to obtain the classified HEGM data and the RFP must have a valid Facility Clearance (FCL) approved by Defense Security Services (DSS). In addition, the Government will issue the company a DD Form 254, prior to the release of any classified data requested during the formal RFP phase.</p>
<p>For companies that do not possess a FCL, the following is a general overview of the FCL request process: Once a company has a need for an FCL, they must be sponsored by either a Government contracting agency (ACC-NJ) or by another cleared defense contractor with a valid FCL. The sponsor will then prepare and submit the FCL package to DSS. DSS will then review the package and start to process/investigate the company. Once the investigation is completed, DSS will notify the company and the sponsor their determination that an FCL is granted or denied. More information regarding the FCL process can be found at the following DSS website: http://www.dss.mil/isp/fac_clear/fac_clear.html</p>
<p>In addition to having a FCL, the contractor must also fill out the following forms in order to gain access to the HEGM data: Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (DD Form 2345), Technical Data Questionnaire (AMSTA-AR 1350), Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and Department of Defense (DoD) Contract Security Classification Specification (DD254). These four (4) forms will be attachments in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement once the RFP is posted. All forms shall be completed and submitted accordingly to the contact listed below.</p>
<p>Lastly, please submit all questions, if any, relating to the HEGM acquisition to: jennifer.m.hughes56.civ@mail.mil. All inquiries shall be made via e-mail only. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Any information or exchanges between contractors and the Government concerning this notice are at no additional cost and/or obligation to the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</strong>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is seeking to continue the "Study of Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Belarus", a large-scale epidemiological study detecting thyroid and other pathology in persons who have been exposed to radiation as released by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in April 26, 1986. The study involves two cohorts: (1) the "main cohort" that was established in the late 1990s and consists of about 12,000 subjects who were age 18 or under at the time of the accident, had their dose to the thyroid gland measured, and lived in the Chernobyl affected areas in Belarus; and (2) the "in-utero cohort" that was established in 2017 and consists of about 2,800 persons who were exposed to Chernobyl fallout radiation in-utero and early post-natal life. The main emphasis of this procurement is to conduct medical screening for thyroid cancer and diseases in the recently established in-utero cohort. The main cohort, after having undergone three cycles of thyroid screening, transitioned to linkage-based passive follow-up.</p>
<p>The objectives of the contract are: for the in-utero cohort, (1) to conduct  medical screening for thyroid cancer and thyroid non-cancer disease; (2) to evaluate the reliability of questionnaire-based doses previously reconstructed; and, for both the main and in-utero cohorts: (3) to maintain passive follow-up to update occurrences of thyroid cancer, other cancer and thyroid non-cancer disease, through linkage with the Chernobyl State Registry and the National Belarusian Cancer Registry; (4) to provide support for the study of genome characterization of thyroid cancer conducted by NCI in Belarus; (5) to conduct clinical follow-up of cohort subjects with previously diagnosed thyroid cancer; and for the main cohort only: (6) to collect data on thyroid cancer risk factors and other information through a mail survey.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, GU RNPTS RMIECH, Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. GU RNPTS RMIECH is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor is uniquely qualified as the only source that can provide the services for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.	The Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology (RRCRM&amp;HE) is the only organization that has the requisite infrastructure and expertise for this project. The Contractor is the only organization that has established and maintained databases on the main cohort of approximately 12,000 subjects and has recently assembled the in-utero cohort of approximately 2,800 subjects.</p>
<p>2.	As the designated institution of all Chernobyl related research by the Belarusian Government, the Contractor is the sole source for conducting of medical screening among the Belarusian population affected by the Chernobyl accident. The Contractor has conducted two medical screenings of the main cohort of approximately 12,000 subjects in the 2000s.</p>
<p>3.	The Contractor is the only organization that has IRB approval and the necessary approvals from the National Cancer Registry and State Chernobyl Registry in Belarus to provide support for this study and conduct data linkage. The Belarusian Government has designated the Contractor to be the official institution devoted to studies of the aftereffects of the Chernobyl accident and mandated that all research related to the Chernobyl accident go through the Contractor. As such, the Contractor is the only institution who has access to the study population.</p>
<p>4.	The Contractor is the only organization that has collected data on thyroid cancer risk factors and other information through interviews of approximately 12,000 subjects of the main cohort in the 2000s. The Contactor is the only organization that can conduct a mail survey of the same population as it is the only institution who has the contact information to access the study population.</p>
<p>5.	The Contractor is the sole source of the data collected on the two important cohorts exposed early in life (such as fetuses, children or adolescents) who experienced fallout from Chernobyl. The Contractor has accumulated a substantial amount of data by following the malignant and benign thyroid disease experience in this cohort since 2004. Only through an active collaboration with the Contractor can NCI gain access to this valuable data and make productive use of it. No other such cohort of substantially exposed children exists in Belarus and there is no other reasonable alternative to contracting directly with this Contractor.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to continue with one source under authority FAR 6.302. However, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency. Respondents should submit their capability statements via email to Jame Chang at jame.chang@nih.gov no later than 12:00PM Eastern on October 30, 2017.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

<DESC><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>
<p>This is a notice of a proposed contract action issued in accordance with FAR 5.203(a). The Government intends to issue RFP No. N01TR-18-2006, titled "Reagent Generation for Bioanalytical Method Development for Biologics," via FedBizOpps on or about October 31, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE:</strong></p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development.<br /><br />The objective of this contract is to support the DPI drug development programs by generating reagents (e.g. polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies) that will be used in bioanalytical assay development to quantify concentrations of novel biologics and anti-drug antibodies(ADA) in biological samples (e.g. plasma, serum and tissue homogenate) collected from preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies, as well as human pharmacokinetic studies in clinical trials.<br /><br />Under this contract, novel biologics include but are not limited to the following:  mAbs, recombinant human proteins, Fc-fusion proteins, bio-functional proteins, PEGylated or other engineered peptides, protein fragments, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), engineered human genes and carriers, in plasma/serum, tissue homogenates, and CSF.<br /><br />This RFP is a follow-up solicitation to NCATS RFP No. N01TR-17-2004, "CRO Support for NCATS Bioanalytical Method Development for Biologics," that was issued on January 26, 2017. In that RFP, the Statement of Work was divided into four technical areas:  Technical Area 1:  Reagent Generation; Technical Area 2:  Bioanalytical Method Development for Novel Biologic Drugs; Technical Area 3:  Bioanalysis of Novel Biologic Drugs in Biologic Matrices; and Technical Area 4:  Determination of Anti-Drug Neutralizing Antibodies.  To qualify for award, organizations had to demonstrate capabilities in at least one technical area. <br /> <br />NCATS received no responses in Technical Area 1, Reagent Generation. Therefore, it is issuing a new RFP soliciting responses to the reagent generation requirement.<br /><br /><strong>RELEASE OF SOLICITATION:</strong></p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals on or about October 31, 2017. Proposals will be due 45 calendar days following release of the RFP.</p>
<p>The intended contract will be a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of DPI and this planned project is to bring new drugs to market.  To this end, the Government has issued a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses at 52.227-11 Patent Rights and 52.227-14 Rights in Data.  The deviated language enables DPI contributors to retain control of their intellectual property, and will be included in the RFP and incorporated in any resultant contract.  Prospective Offerors are advised that agreement to the terms of these FAR clauses deviations will be a condition for contract award.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement; therefore, no incumbent information is provided. The Government will select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the basis of award included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date for this action is around July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>ABOUT DPI AND NCATS:</p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development and aims to move small molecule and biologic drug candidates forward in the drug development pipeline to predetermined milestones, at which point DPI will hand off the drug candidate to external partner(s) to bring the novel therapy to patients.</p>
<p>In addition to developing new candidate drugs, DPI seeks to advance the entire field of drug discovery and development by encouraging scientific and technological innovations aimed at improving success rates in the crucial pre-clinical stage of drug development. DPI's model is to operate as a full range small molecule and biologics drug development organization, moving drug candidates through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an IND is filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For certain drug development programs, DPI will support its candidate's development up to human Phase IIB studies if such support will achieve DPI's mission.</p>
<p>DPI conducts drug development as collaborations through programs such as the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) programs. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from NCATS and other NIH institutes, and its R&amp;D operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of DPI in-house staff and DPI partners, who may be the drug originators. Each drug program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment, and a DPI program officer (PO) is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and reporting of the program.</p>
<p>Contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) provide DPI with manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology, regulatory, and clinical operations services to assist with drug development.  Planning and execution of each individual drug development program includes identification of scientific areas best suited for utilization of CROs and CMOs to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program.</p>

<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION-Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for the repair of items to return them to Original Equipment Manufacturer's Specifications.  This effort will support the PMA-290 Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA).</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT- The proposed contract action is for  services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source Argon ST, 12701 Fair Lakes Circle, STE 800, Fairfax, VA 22033-4910 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source.  The duplicative cost and delay are comprised  from the cost to procure, re-tool, reverse engineer, generate acceptance test procedures, perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, underway for sub-surface platforms, and perform stress analysis, which would take a minimum of 3-5 years for development, production, and verification. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All changes that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to the FedBizOpps website.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and / or award.</p>
<p>Questions or inquiries should be directed to Ms. Mellisa Sistare, Code 0233, telephone 812-854-5059, e-mail mellisa.sistare@navy.mil. Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

<p>Additional Important Note for Other than U.S. Small Businesses ONLY.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 52.219-9, if a large business is selected for a contract it must submit acceptable subcontracting plans to be eligible for award. Those firms required to submit subcontracting plans are expected to conduct market research to determine appropriate subcontracting goals. A subcontracting plan is separate from the Small Business Participation plan and must meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan). SUBCONTRACTING PLANS SHALL REFLECT AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTAL CONTRACT DOLLAR COMMITMENTS OFFERED IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN</p>
<p><br />Ample opportunity will exist for subcontracting with all types of small businesses including SDB, WOSB, HZ, and SDVOSB firms. By providing subcontracting opportunities to small business, the large businesses both formally and informally mentor these businesses by helping them gain experience and increase their ability to perform at a higher level. This in turn helps the small business grow as a company and independently compete for larger projects as prime contractors or upper tier subcontractors.</p>

<p>The objective is to provide quality upgrades to the existing Western Range Command Destruct equipment through procurement of hardware and software that is tri-mode capable Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) with 10 kW transmit power that meet range safety requirements within the timeframe of the National Security Agency (NSA) mandate of 2020. The upgrade of highly specialized equipment will be identical to the recent modernization effort accomplished at the Eastern Range. These new Command Destruct System elements will provide the functionality of the existing Command Destruct System, plus add the new EFTS capability to support Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launches. The EFTS capability is being added because the NSA will no longer support High Alphabet (HA) code generation. The HA capability will exist in the new system as it must be designed to support the transition from HA to EFTS until HA is retired by the NSA.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Drug Countermeasures against Bacterial Biowarfare Agents</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>This is a Joint Request for Information (RFI) for the Joint Science &amp; Technology Office (JSTO) and the Joint Product Manager Biological Defense Therapeutics (JPdM-BDTX), issued for planning purposes, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>JSTO and BDTX are directed to develop a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical countermeasure that is efficacious against one or more threats. The medical countermeasure must, at a minimum, demonstrate non-GLP in vivo efficacy consistent with the product's intended use in a suitable animal model targeted at one or more of the following pathogens:</p>
<p>o Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax)<br />o Brucella spp. (Brucellosis)<br />o Burkholderia mallei (Glanders)<br />o Burkholderia pseudomallei (Melioidosis)<br />o Coxiella spp. (Q Fever)<br />o Francisella tularensis (Tularemia)<br />o Yersinia pestis (Plague)</p>
<p>The Joint Science and Technology Office is responsible for discovery and development of a translational pipeline with the advanced developer (JPdM-BDTX) for medical countermeasures (MCM) for Multi-Drug Resistant bacterial biological warfare agents.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information about the developmental status of any next-generation or novel antibiotics/anti-infectives with activity against BW agents.</p>
<p>The Government is surveying the market to identify potential sponsors that can perform all required activities to support preclinical development, IND-enabling, filing of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and advanced development through approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) / Biologics License Application (BLA) by the FDA, and all activities for regulatory approval of medical countermeasure (MCM) candidates. The Government is seeking companies with expertise in the performance of preclinical development, safety and tolerability trials in humans, and studies to show efficacy against an aerosol challenge in a validated animal model. Familiarity with Animal Rule Guidance for development of MCMs against biowarfare threats and the ability to demonstrate efficacy against an aerosol challenge is highly desirable.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<p>The Government requests that potential performers provide up to a 3 page response that fully describes their medical countermeasure(s) and provides information as requested in this RFI.</p>
<p>At a minimum, 1) maturity level form - Attachment I and, 2) the areas listed below A-I, shall be addressed. Please explain what areas have not been addressed, and how the gaps in knowledge will be filled.</p>
<p>a. Completion of Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and bio-distribution studies</p>
<p>b. Route of administration (oral, intramuscular, inhalation, other)</p>
<p>c. Synopsis of any relevant experience with the FDA (including Investigational New Drug (IND) or response to emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) requests). Clinical trials that used proposed MCM for any indication or IND application with the proposed MCM or other drug under development</p>
<p>d. Shelf life (in years) of drug product supported by Non-Good Manufacturing Practice (Non-GMP) stability studies</p>
<p>e. Describe studies completed in animal models in agents targeted to include route of challenge</p>
<p>f. Storage requirements as demonstrated by studies (room temperature, refrigerated, frozen)</p>
<p>g. Number of treatment courses produced in a single manufacturing run</p>
<p>h. Estimated cost per treatment course</p>
<p>I. Any associated intellectual property rights or patent coverage</p>
<p>Administration: The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI. Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government security classification markings. All written responses must be received by COB on 3 November 2017. Responses should be sent by e-mail to: contracts.mcdc@ati.org, with Subject Line of Responding Organization and RFI Title. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired.</p>

This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government wide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Government wide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code(s) is/are: Other Computer Related Services (541519), standard size $27.5M.</p>
<p>If a potential vendor believes they can provide services which meet or exceed the requirements identified in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement but under a different NAICS code, please feel free to respond to this Sources Sought document and identify the appropriate NAICS code and why you believe it is appropriate.</p>
<p>A continuing need is anticipated for Information Technology Support Services which is currently being fulfilled through current contract number W91QUZ-11-D-0011-1N01. Attached is the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for your review and consideration.</p>

<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3.

<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

<p>Should a company wish to be reviewed and qualified as an "Approved Source",<br />they may submit an application package through the DLA Land and Maritime<br />Alternate Offer / Source Approval Request (SAR) Program. A SAR package<br />contains all technical data needed to demonstrate that the prospective<br />contractor can competently manufacture the product to the same level of<br />quality or better than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The onus<br />is on the contractor to document and demonstrate their product is equal to,<br />or better, than the currently approved item which DLA Land and Maritime is<br />procuring.</p>
<p>For further information, please reference the DLA Land and Maritime web page<br />shown below and click on the highlight: Alternate Offer/Source Approval<br />Program for a detailed explanation for the information and format necessary<br />for a SAR and for the SAR approval process.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


Introduction

This request seeks a solution to automate scheduling and staffing processes; provide decision support for staff assignments based on the objective and variable data supposed to the best estimates; improve patient care by matching nursing competency to required needs. Allows self-scheduling options to nursing providers and data for outcome measurements. This will enable Nursing Service to create strategic plans based on retrievable and accurate data. The system will accommodate today s increasing staffing challenges by using 21st century technology.

The system shall automate labor intensive time consuming processes that are now manually interfaced with multiple applications that increase efficiencies, data quality, and to support decision making. Staffing schedules are currently created several weeks in advance; however, as a patient population and available resources can change in a matter of hours, it is critical to have access to employee information to be able adjust staffing arrangements to manage the clinical nursing needs of Veterans and to facilitate communication in changing needs within the facility and with the employees. Because nursing care is delivered 24 hours/7 days a week, ability to access and modify scheduling by managers, supervisors and chiefs in needed.

Resource management not only involves staff planning, but also scores of managerial tasks including adherence to directives limiting hours of work in a given time period, regulatory dictates, and special pay and time and time accounting accordance to defined payment schedules Nurses functioning as managers must have the flexibility to determine the appropriate level of nurses for patient care needs while considering a constellation of important variables, including the various education and experience levels of staff. The number of staffing orientation, the number of temporary staff on the unit, the acuity of patients, anticipated acuity on a particular shift, the physical layout of the unit, the availability of hospital resources, the technology on the unit, and the unit turbulence (such as the number of admissions, discharges and transfers.)

Scope

An integrated system and automated data extraction tools are necessary to effectively assign staffing resources and monitor standards of care.  This system will pull from systems that have data stored to avoid duplicate effort and to feed the other downstream data systems.

The primary use of the system will be staffing scheduling, so managers can coordinate schedules, capture data, produce reports, and coordinate work assignments to meet patient care needs. The primary users of the system are managers, supervisors, service chiefs and secretaries, who will coordinate schedules, capture data, produce reports, and coordinate work assignments for the following services:

Justification

An integrated system and automated data extraction tools that are necessary to effectively assign staffing resources, monitor standards of care, and pulled from systems that already have the data entered in them to avoid duplicate effort and to feed the other downstream data systems.  For example, there is a need for an acuity/patient classification system to match the changing care needs of the patients to the appropriate staffing level based on the patient condition and the amount of nursing required to manage the care of each patient.

Hospital based staffing requires 24-hour coverage a day, 7 days a week. Nursing hours worked frequently involve a variety of shifts that require an hourly rate increase; in addition, contracts/agency and travel nurses all have different compensation requirements.  Therefore, a resource management system needs to accurately correlate and calculate time and cost by work unit, nurse position type, and pay variables.  

Nurse Executives need data to plan for current and future staffing needs and costs which requires tools to help them manage their workforce.  Multiple standardized reports are needed as well as the ability to create ad hoc reports.  

Benefits  

The need/problem/opportunity: there is no real-time dynamic, integrated system that provides comprehensive and systematic accounting of nursing workload and staffing requirements, and scheduling needed to meet federal law and other regulatory requirements. 

Successful benefits would be:  Appropriate response to the fluctuations in patient census and acuities by using embedded decision support tools.  Adequate staffing levels based on patient acuity and other care related variables.  Collection of nationally comparable hours per patient day (HPPD) data.  Collection of data to prepare budget and reports, develop strategic plans, and improve hiring practices.  Compliance with various regulatory mandates for staffing regulations and monitoring of those regulations.  Ability to consolidate multiple administrative needs in one package (licensure, certifications, emergency notifications, etc.). Generation of predefined and ad hoc reports.  Self-scheduling ability (major nursing satisfier). Accurate accounting of contract/agency nursing utilization.  Success factors: production of accurate HPPD data.  Increase in efficiencies in managing staffing scheduling issues by 50%.

<p>5.	Description:  <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest biomedical research agency in the world. A part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it is the federal agency whose mission it is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conduct, support and make medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) focuses on getting more treatments to more patients more quickly. Several thousand genetic diseases affect humans, of which only about 500 have any treatment. A novel drug, device or other intervention can take about 14 years and $2 billion to develop, with a failure rate exceeding 95 percent. NCATS is directly addressing this problem by discovering new technologies and other approaches that could greatly accelerate the process of developing and deploying solutions that can be used by all translational researchers.<br />The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules for application against a wide range of human diseases.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to store seven (7) ultra-low temperature freezers containing small molecules at a facility that will monitor them 24/7.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RFI Description:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding industry's capabilities and related experience for engineering and production of the Navy's future display systems and peripherals for FY 2020 through FY 2025. The primary efforts include:<br />1. Production of display and peripheral equipment, ancillary equipment and spares Technology Insertion (TI) 16<br />2. Engineering services to update and maintain the TI 16 Technical Data Package (TDP)<br />3. Engineering services to provide technical data for the follow-on TI 16 TDP</p>
<p>The USN program provides the human machine interface to allow operators access to their mission applications and related cameras, remote displays and printers. This is shipboard tactical equipment which meets Navy Surface Ship Environmental Qualification Requirements for installation aboard US and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) ships to include cruisers, destroyers, frigates, amphibious command, amphibious transport, and aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a majority of the work to be performed at the contractor's site.</p>

<p><br />RFI Purpose:</p>
<p>For this RFI, the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) would like to gauge industry interest and capability in providing production and engineering for the USN's future display and peripheral equipment and for industry to identify barriers to their participation in a future competitive procurement. The Navy estimates that the engineering services required will total less than five percent (&lt;5%) of the total proposed cost during the period of performance.</p>
<p>PEO IWS is interested in the full potential of industry responses including small businesses.</p>
<p>The scope of work requires demonstrated experience with the production, integration, assembly, test, design, and logistical support for display systems and peripheral equipment. Due to the nature of this requirement, the company will need to demonstrate the required level of technical expertise and the production capability necessary to deliver the fully tested equipment on time to meet shipyard schedules.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall address the following in the RFI submission:</p>

<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors that can provide the following:
<p>1 set of 4 Shutter Blades with an option to buy a 2nd set of 4 more.</p>
<p>LSST Camera Shutter Overview:</p>
<p>The LSST Camera Shutter controls exposure duration and interrupts light while the image is read out and the telescope is being re-positioned for the next exposure. It is a double-bladed guillotine style mechanical shutter that lies tightly packaged between the L3 lens/cryostat window and the filter and its exchange system. The Shutter controls the length of time that the sensors on the focal plan are exposed to an image while blocking out all stray light when closed during read-out of the CCD sensors. The shutter is a two-blade design, where flat blades move across the focal plane to start or end an exposure. This double-acting shutter includes two shutter blade stacks. The first opens to one side to expose the field of view (FOV), beginning the exposure; then, the second blade set occludes the FOV by deploying from the opposite side, traveling in the same direction as the first. For the next exposure, the process is reversed. This provides a uniform exposure time for all pixels, since the first pixel exposed by the trailing edge of the first blade stack is also the first blocked by the leading edge of the second stack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. VENDORS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" VIA THE FBO PORTAL. DO NOT CONTACT THE SUBCONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR.</p>

This does not include initial visits to obtain user requirements from VA staff and other visits.

Bid Deduct Alternates shall be clearly identified on contract drawings and price breakdown shall be provided for in addition to the base offer s construction estimate. 

All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73, the total cost of the contract for A-E services must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated A-E firm selected to complete the design.

Interested firms should submit one paper copy and one CD copy of their current SF-330 to: Nebraska-Western Iowa HCS, Omaha VA Medical Center, ATTN:  Sharon Spohn (90C), 4101 Woolworth Avenue, Omaha, NE 68105-1850.

Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified.  Questions may be directed only by e-mail to Sharon.Spohn@va.gov.

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 

Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $2,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  
Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 

The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.

The awarded A-E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A-E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A-E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF-330 in the  Find a Form  block and click on search.

Introduction

To accelerate better and more responsive service to the Veteran,the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)is making a deliberate shift towards becominganApplication Programming Interface (API)driven digital enterprise. A cornerstone of this effort is thesetup ofastrategicOpenAPI Programthat is adopting an outside-in, value-to-businessdrivenapproach to create APIs that are managed as products to be consumed by developers within and outside of VA.

Objectives

Platform Vision

VA has started the process of establishing an API Management Platform, named Lighthouse.  The purpose of Lighthouse is to establish the Next Generation Open Digital Platform for Veterans, accelerating the transformation in core domains of VA, such as Health, Benefits, Burial and Memorials. This platform will be a system for designing, developing, publishing, operating, monitoring, analyzing, iterating and optimizing VA s API ecosystem. These APIs will allow VA to leverage its investment in various digital assets, support application rationalization, and allow it todecouple outdated systems and replace them withnew, commercial, off the shelf,Software as a Service (SaaS)solutions. It will enable creation of new, high value experiences for our Veterans,VA sprovider partners,and allow VA s employees to provide better service to Veterans.

In many ways,the LighthouseAPIplatformis the bedrock ofthe Open Digital VeteranPlatform whichwill allowVA to achieve the following objectives:

Integrate more effectively with the community care providers by connecting members of a Veteran s  Care Team  from within and outside the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); and, generate greater opportunities for collaboration across the care continuum with private sector providers,
Effectively shift technology development to commercial electronic health record (EHR) and administrative systems vendors that can integrate modular components into the enterprise through open APIs, thus allowing VAto leverage these capabilitiestoadopt more efficient and effective care management processes,
Foster an interoperable, active, innovation ecosystem of solutions and services through its Open API Framework that contributes to the next generation of healthy living and care models that are more precise, personalized, outcome-based, evidence-based, tiered andconnected across the continuum of care regardless of where andhow care is delivered,
Create an open, accessible platform that can be used not only for Veterans care but also for advanced knowledge sharing, clinical decision support, technical expertise, andprocess interoperability with organizations through the U.S. care delivery system. By simplifying access to the largest data set of clinical data anywhere, albeit de-identified, it will accelerate the discovery and development of new clinical pathways for the benefit of the Veterans and the community at large.

The Lighthouse platform will also generate opportunities toa deploy a single CustomerRelationship Management(CRM) systemthat will help VAmanage its relationship with the Veteran through a single lensandprovidehighly sophisticated ways to engage with the Veteran that includes, web, chat, video, phone and social media.Through APIs,information that is spread across siloes of legacy systems and databases,will be consolidatedinto the CRM platform, that will aid VA staff in providing highly personalized experiencesby tracking all engagement encounters through a common integrated platform and ensuring 100% closed-loop closure of Veteran requests. This will provide a consistent experience for the Veteranirrespective of the departmentthat the Veteran interacts with.To provide such an experience,the API Platform willneed tointegrate informationfromdisparatesource systemsthat hosts Veterans data such as Enrollment, Eligibility, Care Requests and Care Plans.

Product Roadmap

VA is currently on-track tolaunch a Minimum Viable Product(MVP)representing thebasic components of the Platform as well asAPIs representing the Health domain that conforms to the USCore Profiles of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards.

Beyond the MVP, VA willgrow andextend the platform to support:
The API Gateway, through creating the facades for common, standard Health APIs will allowmultipleEHRsto freely and predictably interoperate with eachotheras VA deploys the COTSEHR through the enterprise and finds itselfwith multiple EHR's during the transitionand stabilization phases of the implementation.
Establish the Single Point of Interoperability withhealth exchanges andEHR systemsof Community Care Providers.
The development of APIs across the enterprise spanning additional domains following a federateddevelopment approach that can see an exponential growth in the number APIs offered by the platform.
Operate at scale to support the entire population of Veterans, VA Employees and Community Providersthatprovidea variety of services to the Veterans

c. Objectives

The objective isto operate and grow the Lighthouse API Platform, which at its core is currently built onMuleSoft sAPI Gateway Management platform. Lighthouse presents a straight forward and usable way for developers to consume APIs that hide the complexities of backend systems.The LighthouseAPI Gatewayhas adoptedafacadepattern that provides a simple interfaceto multiple complex subsystems, including its most complex subsystem, theVistAEHR.Its purpose is to articulate internal systems and make them useful fora variety ofapplication developers.

Traditional Service Oriented Architecture strategy uses a standards committee approach in the development of Enterprise Interfaces. VA has, in the past, used this approach. While there are certain advantages to using such an approach,such as,creating a sense of unification across many stakeholders and contributors, the major drawback to the approach is that it is very slow. VA s objective is to distribute the development of endpoints so that a single team does not become a bottleneck.This also eliminates the need for a team to have expertise on every backend system before itcan developthe endpoints.With this approach, each domainteam, with expertise in their specificbackend systemsthatsupporttheirdomainwouldtake a product management approach to their APIs, where the APIs are their products. They could then obtain feedback from the  market    both internal or external teams   and proactively offer APIs for this demand.TheseAPIs will then bepublishedand accessibleon the Lighthouse API platform.

To achieve such an objective, VA envisionsanAPI Program Core Team (Contractor)that will establish core processes, policies and framework for distributed, federated development of APIs.Whereas the domain teams will be responsible forthecompletelife cycleof APIs and will includethe planning, design, implementation, publication,maintenance and retirement of APIsin their specific domains, the API Program core team will be responsible foroperatingthe platformat scale, through established Service Level Agreements with the VA,as a Private Software as a Service that will conform to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Federal Information Security management Act (FISMA) High security standards.

<DESC>The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), an agency of the Department of Defense (DoD), serves the DoD community as the largest central resource for DoD and government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business related information available today.<br /><br />The Information Analysis Centers (IACs) are research and analysis organizations established by the Department of Defense (DoD) and operated by DTIC, to help researchers, engineers, scientists and program managers throughout the Government utilize existing Scientific and Technical Information (STI) to solve their most difficult challenges. Specifically, IACs improve the productivity of researchers, engineers, and program managers in the defense and civilian agency research, development, and acquisition communities by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide STI in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas. To accomplish the objectives above, IACs establish and maintain comprehensive knowledge bases that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. IACs historically also worked directly with customers on contractor-performed, customer-funded Technical Area Tasks (TATs) (task orders), which yield new STI. <br /><br />2. Objective<br />DTIC requires a data warehouse contractor (referred to herein as "Contractor A" or "data warehouse contractor") to: 1) Receive the selected hardcopy STI from the current contractor (referred to herein as "Contractor B" or the outgoing contractor") (in the event contract turnover occurs), which will be delivered by the current contractor to the data warehouse contractor at the incoming's contractors' expense, and unpack, inventory/catalogue and store it, 2) develop and maintain a single electronic metadata database and catalog for the transferred STI, 3) In response to requests from the DSIAC contractor: retrieve, scan/digitize, and transmit STI and its metadata "on demand" to DSIAC, and 4) digitize, using OCR conversion and other methods as appropriate to the media, hard copy documents, microfiche, and microfilm, providing the digitized products to DTIC for its technical library. The overarching intent of this effort is not to preserve paper documents or microfiche/microfilm per se but rather to enable DSIAC customers to electronically research and retrieve from this collection selected materials when needed. The entire media collection must be stored and electronically catalogued so as to enable digital conversion and transmission of those selected materials that have current research value to the DSIAC and DTIC user base. <br />

<CONTACT>ALEXANDER CANCELA, Email ALEXANDER.CANCELA@NOAA.GOV
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br /><br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), requires completing work associated with the Periodic Safety Test Procedure (PSTP) as required by ABS and USCG on the NOAA Ship Ferdinand Hassler. <br /><br />These services will be provided by Richardson Electrical located 17 Batchelder Rd, Seabrook, NH. 03874.Regulatory Bodies (ABS and USCG) require periodic testing of the electrical distribution system on board a ship. This testing includes power generating equipment, switchboard, pumps, motors, transformers, cabling, associated appurtenances, etc. Further, lifecycle maintenance of this equipment must also be performed in a safe way.
<p>The testing procedure and maintenance guidelines are outlined in a PSTP. The PSTP is a unique document that is customized for each ship. The PSTP delivered with the ship was unsafe and was ultimately disapproved by the USCG. A significant amount of engineering effort has been expended to evaluate the as-built condition of the ship, the drawings, and the PSTP to bring the PSTP up to requirements. The SOW associated with this PO request is to perform the industrial work to bring the PSTP up to code and is the end of a long string of related efforts.</p>
<p>Richardson Electric was hired (Contract: EA-133M-16-SE-0480) previously to evaluate the PSTP and the as-built condition of the vessel and then make recommendations for updating the ship and the PSTP.</p>
<p>The requirements are as follows:<br />&bull; Execute the recommended actions in the updated PSTP (updated PSTP written by Richardson Electrical under previous PO)<br />&bull; Update the PSTP to incorporate the recommended updates.<br />&bull; Update effected AutoCAD drawings.<br />&bull; Perform final ship check to ensure satisfactory operation of recommended updates.<br />&bull; Perform crew training of proper testing using the PSTP as a guide.</p>
<p>All items shall be service/delivered to the NOAA Ship Ferdinand Hassler currently located at 29 Wentworth Road New Castle, NH 03870<br />The Government is not aware of any other vendors that can provide this specialized service while also meeting all of the requirements listed above.<br /><br />The intended procurement is for support services for the NOAA Ship Ferdinand Hassler PSTP. The Government intends to acquire services under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Richardson Electrical under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 336611, Ship Building and Repair with a business size standard of 1250 employees.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 5:00 PM EST on October 19, 2017. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>
<p>Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Alexander Cancela at alexander.cancela@noaa.gov by 5:00 PM EST on October 19, 2017.</p>

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>
<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Preface<br /><br />Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR is an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address:<br /><br />Federal Emergency Management Agency<br />Office of Alternative Dispute Resolution<br />500 C Street SW, Suite 840<br />Washington, DC 20472<br /><br />If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.<br /><br />These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.<br /><br />Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO.<br /><br />These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.<br /><br />B. Definitions.<br /><br />(1) "Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />(2) "Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest. Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.<br /><br />(3) "Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.<br /><br />C. Submission Guidelines.<br /><br />(1) Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:<br /><br />a. Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to:<br /><br />Gary P. Topper, Contracting Officer<br />Department of Homeland Security/FEMA<br />OCPO/Preparedness Section<br />Building D, Room 116<br />16825 South Seton Avenue<br />Emmitsburg, MD 21727<br />301-447-7280<br />301-447-1092 - FAX<br /><br />-OR-<br /><br />David Orris<br />Ombudsman<br />Department of Homeland Security/FEMA<br />OCPO<br />Building D, Room 123<br />16825 South Seton Avenue<br />Emmitsburg, MD 21727<br />301-447-1830<br />301-447-1092 - FAX<br /><br />b. The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".<br /><br />c. If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).<br /><br />(2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.<br /><br />(3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:<br /><br />a. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;<br /><br />b. the solicitation or contract number;<br /><br />c. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;<br /><br />d. copies of relevant documents;<br /><br />e. a request for ruling by the agency;<br /><br />f. a statement detailing the form of relief requested;<br /><br />g. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and<br /><br />h. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.<br /><br />(4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.<br /><br />D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.<br /><br />(1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.<br /><br />(2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.<br /><br />(3) Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".<br /><br />b. Appeals<br /><br />i. Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.<br /><br />ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).<br /><br />iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.<br /><br />iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.<br /><br />(4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman:<br /><br />a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.<br /><br />b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.<br /><br />E. Dismissal of Protests.<br /><br />The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of protest).<br /><br /><strong>NARA RECORDS MANAGEMENT LANGUAGE FOR CONTRACTS<br /></strong><br />The following standard items relate to records generated in executing the contract and should be included in a typical Electronic Information Systems (EIS) procurement contract:<br /><br />1.

<p><strong>QUOTE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>This section specifies the format and content that offerors shall use in this Request for Quote (RFQ). The intent is not to restrict the offerors in the manner in which they will perform their work but rather to ensure a certain degree of uniformity in the format of the responses for evaluation purposes. Offerors shall submit a quote that is legible and comprehensive enough to provide the basis for a sound evaluation by the Government. Information provided shall be precise, factual, and complete. Legibility, clarity, completeness, and responsiveness are of the utmost importance. Quotes shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a response to, each of the areas identified. Any quote that does not provide, as a minimum, that which is required in this solicitation may be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration. A complete quote shall be submitted by the closing date specified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall propose a firm fixed price quote for each CLIN set forth in the Price Schedule (above). Offerors may submit price quotes using the above price schedule format, or in their own normal commercial quote format as long as the above price schedule information is included. Price quotes shall also include the offeror's company name, address, phone number, DUNS or CAGE Code, and reference the RFQ number (70FA2018Q00000003).</p>
<p>Offerors shall include with their quote any applicable technical descriptions, brochures, drawings, floorplans, photographs, and/or any other materials sufficient enough to support that their proposed item meets the requirements of the Statement of Work (attached).</p>
<p>a. Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors (FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items). This provision shall be completed by the offeror and submitted as part of the Quote.<br /><br /><strong>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1.1 All items shall be quoted; incomplete quotes may not be considered. This is an "All or Nothing" acquisition. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedure to make a best value award. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quotations will be made. For those offerors which are determined to be technically acceptable, award will be made to that vendor with the lowest overall price. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with offerors (except clarifications). Therefore, the offeror's initial quote should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and also provides the best value to the Government based on the results of the evaluation described in paragraph 1.2 below. The Government reserves the right to make no award at all as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>1.2 The LPTA evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>Factor (1) Technical Acceptability: Each offeror's quote shall be evaluated to determine if the proposed items meet the requirements specified in the Statement of Work (attached).</p>
<p>An evaluation rating of Technically Acceptable/Unacceptable will be assigned upon completion of the technical acceptability evaluation. If an offeror receives a technical rating of "Unacceptable" they will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINITIONS/EVALUATION RATINGS:<br /></strong><br />The Technical Acceptability factor will be evaluated against the stated criteria and the rating assigned to each individual technical factor using the following descriptive adjectival ratings:</p>
<p>Acceptable The offeror's proposed items meet the requirements specified in the Statement of Work (attached). <br />Unacceptable The offeror's proposed items DO NOT meet the requirements specified in the Statement of Work (attached).</p>
<p><br />Factor (2) Price Quotation: The offeror's price quote shall be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon total price proposed for the total requirement, including any shipping to/from Anniston, AL (36205).</p>
<p><strong>OFFEROR QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact James Suerdieck by email to: james.suerdieck@fema.dhs.gov. Questions shall be submitted no later than October 24, 2017. No phone calls accepted. Questions submitted after this deadline may not receive a response.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE TO AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS (AAG) FOR SECONDARY CITIES INITIATIVE - FAR 6.302-3 IAW 41 U.S.C 3304(a)(3)
<p>The Department of State Office of Acquisitions Management (A/LM/AQM), on behalf of the Bureau of Intelligence &amp; Research Humanitarian Information Unit (INR/HIU), issues this notice of its intent to negotiate a sole source contract with The American Association of Geographers (AAG), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, to provide mapping services, as well as administrative oversight and project management support services. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It has been determined that the AAG has both significant existing experience with this initiative and has at its disposal a vast network of professional geographers and partner organizations focused on sustainability and a holistic approach to urban development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Mapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency and Emergency Preparedness addresses critical capacity and data needs in rapidly growing urban areas in developing countries - secondary cities.  Secondary cities are regional hubs of commerce, governance and services undergoing rapid transformation due to development pressures.  This work shall provide a strategy to build local capacity in using open source geospatial technologies, strengthen international partnerships, and create new data in secondary cities that are frequently data-poor, under-resourced, and lagging behind in the provision of infrastructure and essential services.  Mapping these cities is an essential activity in building resiliency and devising robust emergency management plans.<br /><br />Secondary City (2C) projects will be implemented in select cities throughout the world based on proposals solicited from US Embassies and their partners that may include international non-governmental organizations and universities.  These proposals will be reviewed and approved by DOS staff and submitted to the contractor to establish agreements (for example, subcontracts or letters of agreement) for each city.  It is expected that up to eight cities may be approved for projects in FY18 to include some existing FY17 project cities that may receive FY18 funding.<br /><br />At the city level, the projects will create foundation human geography geospatial data.  In-country training to local project personnel will facilitate on-going data collection and mapping, using a train the trainer model.  The HIU will provide technical oversight to all city projects to include directing work, research protocol guidance, as well as scoping visits and initial training.  <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The projects will be enhanced by cooperation with contractor's extensive network of professional geographers and partner organizations.</span></em><br /><br />The core project elements that we tested in year one and two of the initiative that were determined to be fundamental to project success include:</p>
<p>1.	Commit to an open data protocol and technology agnostic approach.<br />2.	Establish a partnership with a local university or NGO to conduct training and education on geospatial technologies and applications (generally, a university will have the requisite facilities for training activities.)<br />3.	Utilize participatory mapping to collect human geography data of most interest to decision makers.  <br />4.	Quality-check the data through protocols developed in the training sessions and implemented after project management review. <br />5.	Post newly created and/or acquired data on the Department of State maintained Geonode, an open data portal for the sharing of geospatial data.</p>
<p><br />This notice of the Department's intent is not a request for competitive proposal(s); however, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the Department, assuming it is received by the closing date of this notice.  A determination by the Department whether a competitive procurement is feasible may be based upon responses to this notice and is solely at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>NOTICE TO QUOTERS: Appropriated funds are not presently available for this requirement; however, there is a reasonable expectation that funds will be committed and certified to result in an obligation under an award of a contract. No contract award can be made in absence of appropriated funds to cover the requirement.</strong>
<p>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05018Q9NMED003. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95.</p>
<p>(iv) This solicitation is issued as a small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with an associated small business size standard of $11M.</p>
<p>(v) The resultant contract will consist of five contract line items (CLIN) as follows:<br />00001 Range Services - Base Period (1 Jan 18 - 31 Dec 19) 120 Days<br />10001 Range Services - 1st Option Period (1 Jan 19 - 31 Dec 20) 120 Days<br />20001 Range Services - 2nd Option Period (1 Jan 20 - 31 Dec 21) 120 Days<br />30001 Range Services - 3rd Option Period (1 Jan 21 - 31 Dec 22) 120 Days</p>
<p>(vi) Description of Requirements: Range Services for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Law Enforcement Las Vegas Field Office. All services shall be accomplished in accordance with the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>(vii) Delivery (i.e. range usage) will occur throughout the period of performance, as scheduled. Acceptance and FOB point are at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision. <br /><br />(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br />Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - The quoted range meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The quoted range does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br /><br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><strong>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</strong></p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition:<br />From Paragraph (b)<br />_X_ (4) 52.204-10, Reporting Executive compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (Oct 2016) (Pub.

<p>US Coast Guard SLFC/CPD1/PBPL<br />Attn: Jaime Warren<br />300 East Main Street, Suite 600<br />Norfolk, VA 23510-9102</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS 2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>Cost or Pricing Data<br />It is Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data to support price negotiations.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items is not applicable to this solicitation. In lieu of this provision, quotes will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>Price:<br />The offeror shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled "HSCG80- 18-Q-P45004 - Schedule". Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quote. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities:<br />Technical Acceptability will be evaluated to determine an overall rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable". This will be determined by evaluating the ability of the offeror to provide a sound, compliant approach that meets all requirements listed in the Specification and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of the requirements. It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that their quote clearly demonstrates their ability to perform these requirements. All offerors must provide the following minimum information and documentation with their quotes to be considered technically acceptable:</p>
<p>Technical Approach - Submit a brief overview planning document using any means (computer generated, hand written, etc.) that outlines the strategy for ensuring that this requirement is completed on or before the contract completion date. The planning document shall include at least:<br />1) Proposed schedule, resources, completion-dates, float, and major-milestones for the various tasks required to complete this contract and<br />2) Identify a list of items that may pose the most contract schedule risk and approach to mitigate or eliminate each risk.</p>
<p><br />Welding Certifications/Procedures - Submit welding documentation (e.g. WPSs, welder certs, etc.) in accordance with SFLC Standard Specification 0740_STD, specific to your internal or subcontracted staff, for the weld joints that will be installed.</p>
<p>Past Performance:<br />The Government may utilize any references provided by the Contractor, along with information available from past contracts/orders with the USCG and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to determine if the Contractor has acceptable or neutral Past Performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror. The offeror must provide at least two relevant past performance evaluations within the last two (2) years. Past performance less than satisfactory may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Method<br />The Government will evaluate proposals based on the lowest price technically acceptable criteria. Only the lowest priced offer will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. Should the lowest priced offer not receive an acceptable technical or past performance rating, the process will continue in order of lowest priced offer until the lowest price, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance is identified.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),

into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or

respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Modification #1:</span></strong><br /><br />Please note the following questions have been answered.<br /><br />Q. For the Key Personnel positions (as outlined on pages 67 and 68), can one expert fill multiple positions?<br /><br />
<p>A. It is up to each offeror to propose the best team to carry out the Terms of Reference, showing in their proposal the proposed team's expertise, education, skills, and experience.  If one person can fulfill multiple positions without sacrificing the quality of analysis required by the TOR, it is up to the Offeror to make that determination.  The offer should include the Offeror's organizational structure, management and key personnel. The Selection Criteria are indicated in the RFP and proposals will be ranked accordingly.</p>
<p>Q.  Could you please clarify the expected travel/trips as described on page 69? Please confirm if there is opportunity to modify the trip schedules and attendees to provide the best value to USTDA.</p>
<p>A. It is up to each offeror to describe in their proposal their approach, work plan, and detailed schedule. The offer should describe proposed activities and tasks within the Work Plan, including staffing, meetings, periodic reporting or review points, interim delivery dates, and other project milestones.  The Offeror is free to modify the trip schedules and attendees as long as there is no impact on the quality of the analysis required in the TOR.</p>
<p>Q.  Item 2.7 details that "USTDA grant funds shall not be used to pay any taxes, tariffs, duties, fees or other levies imposed under laws in effect in the Host country".  How are air tickets, local taxes and local subcontractors that are legally obliged to pay local taxes?</p>
<p>A. Please refer to Clause 12 of the Grant Agreement. "USTDA funds provided under this Grant Agreement shall not be used to pay any taxes, tariffs, duties, fees or other levies imposed under laws in effect in Host Country, except for taxes of a de minimis nature imposed on local lodging, food, transportation, or airport arrivals or departures."</p>
<p>Q. The Final Report for this type of an analysis shall be quite lengthy. Could the RFP be modified so that only an Executive Summary shall be translated into Portuguese?</p>
<p>A. The entire Final Report must be translated into Portuguese.  This is a requirement that has been incorporated into the TOR and the Grant Agreement signed by both USTDA and the State of Minas Gerais.</p>

<p>Solicitation Number: 2017-51010A<br />Brazil: Safety Assessment and Improvement Strategy for Congonhas Airport Technical Assistance</p>
<p>The Grantee ("Secret&aacute;ria de Aviac&atilde;o Civil" or "SAC") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the Safety Assessment and Improvement Strategy for Congonhas Airport Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>SAC, the Secretariat of Civil Aviation, is seeking Technical Assistance support to conduct a risk and safety assessment at Congonhas Airport in order to develop a safety assessment and improvement strategy for the Airport.  This will allow the airport to meet federal airport certification requirements and allow for safe growth in flights and passengers.</p>
<p>The selected contractor will assist the Airport by conducting a needs/requirement analysis required by National Civil Aviation Agency ("Ag&ecirc;ncia Nacional de Avia&ccedil;&atilde;o Civil" or "ANAC") in order for this airport to be granted a federal safety certification, including an aeronautical safety and risk analysis and an assessment of compliance with Brazilian and international regulatory requirements.  The selected contractor will also need to consider improvements, new technologies, and mitigation measures to address the nonconforming infrastructure and the impacts on operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $750,900 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA").</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:00 PM (local time in Bras&iacute;lia, Brazil) on November 10, 2017</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>UPDATE - Due to unforseen circumstances, the response date for this presolicitation notice has been extended to October 31, 2017.&nbsp; The time remains the same.&nbsp; Also, the NAICS code for this requirement has been changed from 541690 to 541715 to better fit the requirement.&nbsp; All other aspects of thie presolicitation notice remain the same.&nbsp; Thank you for your interest.<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT. THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.
<p>PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>CONTRACTORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal for a full and open competition for the project titled, "Old Boral<sup>TM</sup> Performance in Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation." The contract type will be Time and Materials. The anticipated period of performance for this contract is two (2) years inclusive of one year base and one 12-month option period.</p>
<p>The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS), requires a contractor to provide support to obtain technical assistance with relevant data and its interpretation of potential older Boral<sup>TM</sup> degradation processes under dry storage and transportation conditions. The contractor shall perform tests to assess the potential degradation processes of those older Boral<sup>TM</sup> type, which have been deployed in some of the storage casks, under spent fuel storage and transportation conditions. The contractor will interpret the obtained data, and provide technical assistance to the NRC's establishment of regulatory safety bases associated with older Boral<sup>TM</sup> used in storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor will do the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Submersion test - The contractor shall design and/or select optimum test equipment with water pressures and duration which best represent the operational conditions of those spent fuel storage casks which have used older Boral<sup>TM</sup>;</p>
<p>&bull; Drying Test - The contractor shall design and/or select optimum test equipment for the drying techniques (i.e., vacuum drying and/or Forced Helium Dehydration) which have been used for drying the loaded spent fuel storage casks with older Boral<sup>TM</sup>;</p>
<p>&bull; Hydrogen Generation Test - The contractor shall design and/or select optimum test equipment of Boral<sup>TM</sup> corrosion and hydrogen generation which best represent the operating conditions of dry storage systems and transportation packages; and</p>
<p>&bull; Data Interpretation and Report Preparation - The contractor shall interpret data properly with literature data, operational experience of spent fuel storage and transportation (plus nuclear reactor pool if appropriate). The contractor shall analyze more quantitatively with numerical analyses if necessary. The contractor should perform data interpretation and analyses for each task individually before the contractor consolidates all analysis.</p>
<p>This requirement does not anticipate subcontracts; therefore a small business subcontracting plan is not required. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e. large businesses, small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service disabled veteran-owned small business.</p>
<p>The preferred method of distributing the NRC Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and NRC bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission. The Contracting Officer has enabled the, "Interested Vendors List (IVL)" feature in fbo.gov for offerors that are interested in teaming opportunities for this requirement.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be posted on fbo.gov (The Government Point of Entry (GPE) on or around October 16, 2017.</p>

The required quantity is 1,200 units with no option shipping to (W25G1U) Susquehanna, PA 17070. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

Please provide a quote for 97 each for either NSN 1680-01-509-5773 or NSN  1680-01-621-2096.                                                         
This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a      
source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of  
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor     
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the 
intended application.  Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and       
selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review     
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession  
and cannot be economically obtained.
                                          
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, 
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not    
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have   
been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the  
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) 
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on 
your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if    
this is an item you have never made.                                          
                                                                              
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data  
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award    
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval    
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval      
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet    
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based 
on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification       
Brochure is now available at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx.

<DESC>Reference is made to Solicitation W912DQ-17-B-1013 for the Stockton Lake Wire Rope Replacement, only one bid was received in response to this solicitation. As a result, the Contract Officer was unable to determine the reasonableness of bid price due to the lack of competition. In accordance with DFARS 215.371-3, this acquisition was required to be completed through negotiations. A request for certified cost or pricing data was requested from the sole bidder.

<p>(a) The extent of participation of small business prime offerors and small business subcontractors in terms of the percentage of the value of the total acquisition. The mandatory minimum goals for Small Business participation is 10% of total contract dollars (aggregate of all small businesses participation including the small business socioeconomic contracting programs (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs). The following are non-mandatory suggested goals which should be determined through market research:<br />1. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 5% of total contract dollars.<br />2. Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) 5% of total contract dollars.<br />3. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) 3% of total contract dollars. <br />4. Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) 3% of total contract dollars.<br />(b)The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically identified in proposals; <br /><br />(c) The extent of commitment to use such firms (existing and enforceable commitments will be considered more favorably than business relationships that are simply planned or theoretical); <br /><br />(d) Identification of the complexity and variety of the work specific small firms are to perform;<br /><br />All Offerors (both large and small businesses) are required to complete the following Small Business Participation Plan Form and submit with their proposal. This form will be the primary source of data used to evaluate the Small Business Participation factor. Offeror's market research and small business participation analysis in accordance with the evaluation criteria listed in the previous paragraphs should be reflected on this form.</p>

<p>Additional Important Note for Other than U.S. Small Businesses ONLY.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 52.219-9, if a large business is selected for a contract it must submit acceptable subcontracting plans to be eligible for award. Those firms required to submit subcontracting plans are expected to conduct market research to determine appropriate subcontracting goals. A subcontracting plan is separate from the Small Business Participation plan and must meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan). SUBCONTRACTING PLANS SHALL REFLECT AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTAL CONTRACT DOLLAR COMMITMENTS OFFERED IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN</p>
<p>(i) <br />Ample opportunity will exist for subcontracting with all types of small businesses including SDB, WOSB, HZ, and SDVOSB firms. By providing subcontracting opportunities to small business, the large businesses both formally and informally mentor these businesses by helping them gain experience and increase their ability to perform at a higher level. This in turn helps the small business grow as a company and independently compete for larger projects as prime contractors or upper tier subcontractors.</p>

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Network Contracting Organization   8 (NCO-8) anticipates the sole source award of a firm-fixed price contract for asbestos abatement survey services required to complete NRM Project 673-17-110. Project will create a survey showing where asbestos is present in building s 1 and 2, at the James A. Haley VAMC, Tampa, FL. The Government estimate for the procurement is $247,942.
Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:   Contractor is to provide asbestos survey services to include all equipment, labor, materials, specialty services, supervision, and tools to complete NRM Project 673-17-120  Asbestos AHERA Survey .  Work includes performing asbestos surveys, and providing documentation on asbestos presence to be used in future construction projects. 

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
      
 ( )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 ( )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (X) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited: 
(a) Veteran s Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 819.7007 Sole Source Awards to a verified service disabled veteran-owned small business. A Contracting Officer may award contracts to verified SDVOSB concerns using procedures other than competitive procedures provided:
(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;
(2) The justification prepared pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii) is posted in accordance with FAR subpart 5.301(d);
(3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance; and
(4) In the estimation of the contracting officer, contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government.
(b) The contracting officer s determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. To ensure that opportunities are available to the broadest number of verified SDVOSBs, this authority is to be used judiciously and only when in the best interest of the Government.
(c) A determination that only one SDVOSB can meet the requirement is not required. However, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii), contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by a written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and 6.304, as applicable.
(d) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure the business meets eligibility requirements 819.7003.
Biosphere International, Inc. is registered in the VIP database as a SDVOSB and is a responsible source with respect to this contract opportunity. 

Contractor has successfully completed similar construction projects at the Tampa VA Hospital that included abatement of hazardous materials in busy areas of the hospital. It is in the best interest of the Government to use a contractor with specialized experience to minimize impact to patients and employees during construction. 

A sole source award is proposed pending negotiation of fair and reasonable price.


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by 5.2 and, if not which exception under 5.202 applies. While there are other contractors in Vetbiz.gov, a determination that only one SDVOSB concern available to meet the requirement is not required per the authority cited in paragraph 5.  The estimated value of this requirement is greater than $25,000 and thus will be synopsized IAW Part 5.301(a) (1).

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The contracting officer anticipates an agreement between Government and Biosphere International, Inc. will result in a Fair and Reasonable Price.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The VIP database was queried in accordance with VAAR 810.001, Market research policy. Biosphere International, Inc. is listed in the CVE database as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.
 
Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Under the authority granted by Public Law 109-461, the VA is authorized to set-aside contracts and/or award sole source awards to SDVOSB and VOSB firms. 

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Not Applicable.  IAW VAAR 819.7007(b) the contracting officer s determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer.  A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  There are no barriers to competition we are using the authority granted by VAAR 819-7007 sole source awards to service disabled veteran owned small business concerns as a tool for construction requirements to repair/fix facility deficiencies.

CO certification that justification is accurate and complete and to the best of the CO s knowledge and belief.:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Maryland, on behalf of the requesting activity, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit Six (NAMRU-6), Virology &amp; Emerging Infections Department, Lima, Peru.<br /><br />2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>NAMRU-6 has a requirement for the purchase of for the purchase of High Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) instruments and supporting supplies that can support the detection and identification of multiple respiratory and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The proposed source is BioFire Defense, located at 79 W 4500 S, Suite 14, Salt Lake City, Utah 84107.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The NAMRU-6 requirement is for High Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) instruments that can support the detection and identification of multiple respiratory and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections.</p>
<p>The following organisms and subtypes must be able to be detected and identified using the required instrument: Adenovirus, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus/ Enterovirus, Influenza A, Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H1-2009, Influenza A/H3, Influenza B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3, Parainfluenza 4, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, among viruses, and Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia among bacteria.</p>
<p>The instrument must be FDA approved.</p>
<p>The instrument must be able to integrate sample preparation, amplification, detection and analysis for 20 or more pathogens simultaneously, into one system that is simple to operate and can complete the entire process in a short period, which enables research physicians to present participants with results and proceed immediately with additional study components and provide mission-critical, real-time, surveillance data for the U.S. DoD and its partners to respond effectively and in a timely manner to protect the health of military forces in deployed areas and to address international public health issues and threats. Traditional methods of PCR can only be performed at advanced facilities with highly skilled and educated technologists, and is labor intensive utilizing a minimum of 4 hours to obtain a result. These delays can endanger participant's health; cause a loss of research participants to follow-up, as well as the associated mission-critical data. Protocol NAMRU.2010.0010 specifically requires that samples collected in the morning to be processed and if positive, follow-up teams are to be deployed during the afternoon to obtain the subsequent data and samples. This protocol and others at NAMRU-6 form a mission-critical, real-time, surveillance data source for the US DoD and its partners to protect health.</p>
<p>The estimated dollar value of the subsequent contract is $391,531.40 (unit cost of $39,761 per biofire kit).The type of funds expected to be utilized are FY 2017 Defense Health Program (DHP) Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funds.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>41 U.S.C. 1901(e)(2), (as implemented by FAR 13.501); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>The BioFire Defense FilmArray BioSurveillance System is a High Multiplex PCR instrument that uses the FA Respiratory Panel (RP) (a multiplexed nucleic acid test) for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral (17 viruses) and bacterial nucleic acids (3 bacteria) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The unit is only one of two instruments that is FDA approved.</p>
<p>This diagnostic platform is already deployed as a central part of multiple ongoing NAMRU-6 research studies at different locations throughout the Americas due to the platform having minimal requirements for trained personnel and lab infrastructure. Other platforms investigated by NAMRU-6 (including traditional PCR methods, Luminex MagPix, TAC-array cards, and MassTag-PCR) have advanced laboratory and personnel requirements that are impossible to project to austere research environments such as local clinics in developing countries. Furthermore, except for the Magpix, these units are not FDA approved.</p>
<p>The Luminex MagPix is FDA-approved and detects all of the required pathogens, but it cannot be deployed to our research sites due to enhanced laboratory requirements and the need for highly trained lab personnel.</p>
<p>NAMRU-6 has considered (and continues to investigate) other platforms (including lateral flow assays from ChemBio, SD Bioline) that are capable of deployment to such areas (including rapid tests by a number of other companies). First, these units are not FDA approved. Second, rapid tests from ChemBio and SD Bioline only detect 1 or 2 pathogen exposures, and suffer from poor performance in pathogen endemic environments such as our research sites). These have been found to have very low performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity as compared to the BioFire platform. The resulting false-positive and false-negative results from these other platforms could skew the data resulting from our investigations leading to erroneous interpretations of pathogen transmission risk to US personnel deployed to those theaters. <br /><br />The Nanosphere respiratory panel does not offer identification of important pathogens (i.e. Coronovirus and its subtypes, enterovirus, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) required for our surveillance DOD program and is not FDA approved.</p>
<p>The BioFire platform provides results by detecting amplified pathogen genomes in a nested assay (as compared to other rapid diagnostic assays reliance on: antibodies - which cross-react with other pathogen species, or: antigens that suffer from a much lower level of detectability than the nucleic acid detection used by BioFire). The Biofire platform requires less hands on time and allows the end user a shorter run time, the ability to be easily performed by non-skilled laboratory personnel (essential for field work and deployment settings) and FDA-approved tests. Furthermore the system saves time while reducing costs, because it simultaneously identifies 17 respiratory viruses and 3 respiratory bacteria within 1 hour. This enables rapid reporting of results to study-associated healthcare providers for better patient care, and reduces the time and cost needed for specimen shipment to central laboratories for advanced diagnostic testing.</p>
<p>The BioFire Diagnostics FilmArray System from BioFire Diagnostics, LLC is the only system that possesses multiplex PCR technology in a single test format with a short (1-hour) turn- around time to final result with multiple targets tailored to each specimen type. No other system provides that is usable in these austere conditions provide testing for all of the required pathogens.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>This requirement will be synopsized via a Notice of Intent to Sole Source on Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) for 15 days. Currently no other sources are being solicited, as Biofire Defense is the sole manufacturer and distributor for this equipment. If another company submits a written interest in this requirement as a result of the announcement, the company's information will be evaluated before the contract is signed with Biofire Defense.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer shall determine the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies covered by the J&amp;A to be fair and reasonable by conducting an appropriate price analysis.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the type of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NMLC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. If future requirements exist that do not involve the same research efforts, the Government will solicit through full and open competition to remove barriers.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL <br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br />1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Maryland, on behalf of the requesting activity, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit Six (NAMRU-6), Virology &amp; Emerging Infections Department, Ave. Venezuela Cdra 36 s/n , Bellavista - Callao - Peru.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>NAMRU-6 requests approval to award a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis for research and development services in support of a viral febrile and respiratory surveillance study for NAMRU-6. The proposed source is The Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.<br /><br />3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide research and development services in support of the studies: NMRCD.2010.0010 "Characterization of the Infectious Causes of Acute Febrile and Exanthematous Illness in Latin America" and NAMRU6.2011.0012 "Surveillance for Emerging Viral Respiratory Pathogens in South America." The services include qualified human resources contracting, operative support, maintenance of laboratory and electronic equipment and documents and samples shipments.</p>
<p>The aim of the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) section at Armed Forced Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) is to contribute to the protection of all Department of Defense healthcare beneficiaries and the global community through an integrated worldwide emerging infectious disease surveillance system. GEIS funds both projects in order to accomplish their objectives. The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6) leads the project as an overseas medical research unit, supporting and strengthening surveillance among U.S. military deployed in Latin America and host country health institutions (military and civilians).</p>
<p>The surveillance network in Peru includes sites located in:<br />1. Lima, capital city of Peru;<br />2. Callao, in the central coast, the main port of entry for the capital city of Lima;<br />3. Piura, in the northern coast province of Piura, a desert region located near the frontier with Ecuador;<br />4. Bagua, Amazonas, a remote semi-jungle area located between the Departments of Cajamarca and Amazonas;<br />5. Yurimaguas, Loreto, a remote jungle city which is the last city available by ground transportation into the Amazonas jungle;<br />6. Trujillo, La Libertad, on the northern coast of Peru;<br />7.

Iquitos, Loreto, the main city located in the middle of the jungle region, only accessible by plane or boat; and,<br />10. Chanchamayo, Junin, located in the center semi-jungle region of Peru.</p>
<p>The surveillance network in the wider Latin America region includes sites located in:<br />1. Meta, Colombia, located in the jungle lowlands<br />2. Medellin, Colombia, located on the highlands<br />3. Cartagena, Colombia, located on the Caribbean shore<br />4. Honduras, Tegucigalpa<br />5. Asuncion &amp; Mariscal Estigarribia, Paraguay</p>
<p>This service requires carrying out the following activities: (please see PWS for details)<br />1. Coordination and obtainment of study authorization from local health facilities to perform the study in Colombia.<br />2. Obtainment of local IRB approval.<br />3. Recruitment of and training local personnel for performing the study.<br />4. Screening at least 200 potential study participants per year at each site.<br />5. Performing the informed consent process as described in the protocol.<br />6. Collecting all study approved information and biological samples.<br />7. Labeling and keeping samples in adequate cold-chain conditions to preserve virus integrity.<br />8. Maintenance of all forms with identifiers in a locked office at the site.<br />9.

Delivery to NAMRU-6 all samples collected as part of the study, consent/assent documents, and all epidemiological forms.<br />11. Reporting of laboratory results provided by NAMRU-6 to local health authorities.</p>
<p>The estimated dollar value of the subsequent contract is $275,753.37. The type of funds expected to be utilized are a combination of FY 2017 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds and FY 2017 Defense Health Program (DHP) Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funds.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), (as implemented by FAR 6.302-1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) is the collaborating institution that has been participating in the above studies since the year 2007, with the renowned Peruvian researcher Dr. Eduardo Gotuzzo as corresponding Principal Investigator. Dr. Gotuzzo is the Principal Professor for the School of Medicine at UPCH and the Director of the "Alexander von Humboldt" Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, also at UPCH. Dr. Gotuzzo is a co-PI on the protocol since its first approval and implementation, therefore his institution, UPCH, has been the main logistical operator in the sites for the past 10 years. Peruvian laws and regulations determine that the sites must be registered with a local entity under the Ministry of Labor, and UPCH has the required permissions to operate at all of the study sites. Furthermore, by way of this long-time collaboration, Dr. Gotuzzo and the NAMRU-6 researchers have described arboviral etiologies of many acute febrile illnesses in Peru; the publication of such research was awarded by the Peruvian Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Development of a scientific study in far-off, remote and many times inaccessible localities within Peru is a complicated process, which must take into account all the idiosyncrasies of the local population. Approval must be secured from local medical authorities, as well as community leaders or even local religious leaders. UPCH has, during the years of collaboration, built an infrastructure of medical doctors and other field personnel, who have won the trust and confidence of the local people, and who make the study possible. Participants will not allow access to a different field worker, or allow their child to have blood drawn by a different medical provider. It is vital for the study that this network of trust be maintained, and that the same collaborating institution participates. As a surveillance study, it is imperative that the same sampling and follow-up procedures be maintained, or the results may vary and lose scientific validity, which would severely impact this 16-year old study.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a major collaborator for the past 10 years, UPCH has a well-developed infrastructure that supports human and technical resources, logistics, legal matters and research activities not only for Peru, but for international sites as well. The institution is highly regarded for its experience in infectious disease research leading the way in all of Peru. Specifically, collaboration with UPCH allows us to work with several other academic institutions in international sites which are our partners within this project. It is essential to continue working with UPCH for this reason as its Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease Institute supports our research objectives and necessary requirements.</p>
<p>Market research has not located a university or private company within Peru that has the research capability and researchers to support a study of this magnitude and thus is unable to meet the Governments requirements. Non Peruvian universities and companies may possess the ability to support this study in terms of their research capability, however market research did not reveal a university or company that possesses the required Government approvals and knowledge of the local culture required to carry out the study. Therefore, UPCH is the only source able to meet the Governments requirement.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>This requirement will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS). Currently no other sources are being solicited. If another company submits a written interest in this requirement as a result of the announcement, the company's information will be evaluated before the contract is signed with Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia. UPCH possesses the unique technological capability and expertise needed to successfully accomplish this essential requirement. They have a large trajectory of research in infectious and tropical diseases, focused on viruses. UPCH has very specific expertise with and access to the human component of the study required and has been specifically targeted for its merit in technological capability and expertise to perform this research requirement.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>The contracting officer will perform a cost analysis in order to determine that the anticipated cost to the Government of the services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable. Pre-negotiated or audited rates will be used where available.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NMLC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
    
VA262-17-AP-8223
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
None
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 

$107,937.51
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUP PLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
 
The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, materials supplies, and parts perform on site full maintenance services on the 3M Abators and Ethylene Oxide (ETO) Sterilizers for VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS), 3350 La Jolla Village Drive, San Diego, CA 92161. The Contractor shall provide the following:

Cleaning of the equipment;
Reviewing operating software diagnosis to ensure equipment is in accordance with the manufacturer s specifications;
Calibrating and lubricating the equipment;
Performing intervening maintenance;
Testing and replacement of faulty and worn parts and/or parts that are faulty, fail, or become worn;
Inspecting and replacing, electrical wiring and cables for wear and fraying
Inspecting and replacing all mechanical components.
Furnishing documentation, all measurements, and calibration data collected to ensure that the system is performing in accordance with the manufacturer s performance standards.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

3M Company is the original manufacturer of the ETO Sterilizers and their associated Abators and holds the proprietary rights to all equipment parts, hardware, and software. These units must be maintained by authorized, trained personnel with access to original equipment parts.  The units form a core set of reprocessing devices used by Sterile Processing Services (SPS) at VASDHS, and can only have minimal downtime without severely affecting the output of SPS. Without these devices, various medical cases have the potential of being cancelled because sterile supplies would not be able to be delivered. They require quarterly preventive maintenance service and continual corrective maintenance that Biomedical Engineering is unable to provide.

Additionally, 3M Company doesn t provide third party vendors authorization to repair and maintain the Ethylene Oxide Sterilizers and their associated Abators equipment. Accordingly, 3M Company is the only firm capable of providing the services described above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Additionally, another type of equipment may exist, but it would cost an expensive amount of monies for a replacement system, it would take up to twelve (12) months to install and more time to train staff. Furthermore, improper maintenance or repair by an unauthorized vendor may lead to voiding any warranties and may lead to inaccurate readings and cancellation of patient treatment. 
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A sources sought notice (VA262-17-N-1505) was issued on www.fbo.gov from July 21, 2017 through August 7, 2017 requesting interested Service Disabled Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), Small Businesses and Women Owned and there were no responses.  A Vetbiz review on September 11, 2017 resulted in over eight thousand (8000) contractors. I called three (3) companies, there was no answer for two of the companies and the other company provided maintenance of emergency vehicles. Many of these companies that are listed on Vetbiz are listed under maintenance and repair resulted in the following: (1) cannot provide maintenance and repair of medical equipment and (2) are not capable to provide the software licensing or parts required for the equipment.

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

VA262-17-AP-10647
1A. PROJECT/TASK No. NONE
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$78,896.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Contractor shall provide the following for elevators S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, P1.
:
Remove the existing obsolete governor from the elevation machine room.
Install one (1) new Hollister Whitney 201 Governor and tail sheave.
Install new 3/8  Governor rope.
Perform a full load safety rest to ensure proper operation.
Adjust as required and return the elevator to service.

The period of performance shall be October 23, 2017-November 23, 2017.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Specialized Elevator is the current contract of the maintenance and repair contract. It is in the best interest of the Government to use the current contract to avoid the following: 
Equipment failure of equipment that is currently maintained.
Disruption of elevator services
Risk of losing warranties.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

The Contractor s technician is on-site and familiar with all requirements for the elevators and services needed. If another contractor is utilized, there will be a learning curve, and if an elevator breaks, VA Loma Linda would not be able to identify who is the cause of the equipment failure. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to utilized the current contractor to avoid the risk of disputes between contractors.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was not conducted as this is a safety issue and must be completed quickly to avoid patients, visitors and employees getting hurt due to equipment failure.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>1. Contracting Activity: Adelphi Contracting Division, Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783</p>
<p>2. Description of Action: ARL-VTD requests a Firm Fixed Price - Level of Effort (FFP-LOE) modification under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Program with Engility Corporation, 35 New England Business Center Drive, Suite 200, Andover, MA  01810-1071. The Government will execute this action against FSS contract GS-23F-0180K.  Projected award is September 2017 and fiscal year 2017, Research, Development, Test &amp; Engineering (RDT&amp;E) funds will be used.</p>
<p>X An acquisition plan is not required because this procurement either does not meet the threshold at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 207.103(d)(i), or is an R&amp;D acquisition and does not meet the definition of services in 10 U.S.C. 2330(c)(2).</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The U.S. ARL-VTD Autonomous Systems Division (ASD) is responsible for developing and demonstrating the advanced robotics technology necessary to create unmanned ground vehicle systems for the Army's Future Force.  ASD manages the ARL Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, a consortium of industrial and academic partners conducting collaborative research with ARL and other Government laboratories and research centers to develop advanced Perception, Intelligent Control, Human-Robot Interaction, and Dexterous Manipulation &amp; Unique Mobility technology. It manages a parallel technology integration and assessment program focused at integrating individual component technologies on relevant tested platforms and assessing performance.  The ASD also has a history of successfully transitioning the resultant technology to Army Research, Development, and Engineering Centers and acquisition programs.</p>
<p>This contract provides Advanced Robotics Technology services, to include: assessments of the maturity and applicability of current robotics technology supporting military unmanned ground vehicles, independent assessments of technical activities being executed under the ARL Robotics Research program, monitoring international technology development activities, development of  program/technical strategy options, preparation of technical and program briefings, full documentation of field experiments and assessments to include graphics, video and still photography (including editing), and prepare data summaries, input into development of experimental programs including detailed experimental design, conduct independent assessments of the readiness of individual technologies for formal experimentation, and tracking of technical status and cost data reported by industrial and academic contractors and other organizations conducting research as well as monitoring of financial status, reporting and funds disbursements for ASD.    <br />The current contract was issued on 25 May 2012, with an original period of performance (PoP) beginning on 01 June 2012 and expiring on 31 May 2017.  A modification (P0001) was issued, at no additional cost to the Government, on 29 May 2013 extending the PoP end dates of all CLINs by two (2) months in order to complete work that was initiated under the base year of this order; this made the PoP end dates of all CLINs end on 31 July of each contract year instead of the original 31 May dates.  Additionally, two (2) modifications (P00017 and P00018) were issued to extend the PoP end date by one (1) month at no additional cost to the Government.  Modification P00017 changed the PoP end date from 31 July 2017 to 31 August 2017 and modification P00018 changed the PoP end date from 31 August 2017 to 30 September 2017.  These modifications were issued to ensure that the final stages of the research initiated under this order could be continued until all findings were completed for the ARL Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance.<br />ARL-VTD requires a modification to extend the task order (TO) W911QX-12-F-0025 for two (2) months from 01 October 2017 to 30 November 2017, in order to complete the work without a stoppage in critical mission activities.  The original TO was competed amongst GSA schedule holders capable of fulfilling the original requirement; Engility Corporation was selected as the awardee.  The Government has a continuous need for the Advanced Robotics Technology Services and the only Contractor available that can provide immediate continuation of services with no stoppage is the current Contractor, Engility Corporation.    <br />Period of Performance: 01 October 2017 to 30 November 2017  <br />Total Value: $299,023.32<br />4. Authority Cited: Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41U.S.C. 251, et. Seq) and Title 40 U.S.C 501, Services for Executive Agencies, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6 and substantiated by the following:</p>
<p>X FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C). In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA was not previously issued under a sole-source or limited-sources procedures.</p>
<p>5. Reason for Authority Cited:</p>
<p>The ARL-VTD requires continued development of advanced robotics technology necessary to create unmanned ground vehicle systems achieved during the original PoP under TO W911QX-12-F-0025 issued to Engility Corporation.  The original order was placed in accordance with all applicable FSS ordering procedures and was not previously issued under sole source procedures.  This order was issued on 25 May 2012 and included a one (1) year base period, with four (4) one (1) year option periods.  All option periods were exercised with a final PoP end date of 31 July 2017.  This will be the first time the authority, above, was used for this particular TO.</p>
<p>This specific requirement must be continued by the ARL-VTD in order to conclude the mission critical research that was conducted during the original PoP.  Extending the order for two (2) months will allow ARL-VTD the time to complete the required research for the ARL Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, which utilizes the research of all parties involved to transition the resultant technology to Army Research, Development, and Engineering Centers and acquisition programs and subsequently the warfighter.  It would benefit the Government to extend this order for the short period required to complete the research so that all results and findings can be concluded and reported to the ARL Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance for further development.  This extension is logical because the current Contractor has completed all research to date for this Alliance and due to their inherent knowledge of the subject it would be beneficial to the Government for them to conclude the research instead of having another Contractor complete the work.</p>
<p>The alternatives to extending this order with the current Contractor are to suspend operations of the program or use in-house personnel/expertise.  Both of these alternatives are not in the Government's best interest as suspending the operation would halt all research conducted to date and could disregard all findings that the current Contractor has concluded and using in-house personnel/expertise will not suffice due to the lack of said in-house personnel within ARL-VTD.  If the Government does not extend the current order, it jeopardizes the mission critical research that has already been conducted.<br />Utilizing another contractor still would not be with the Government's best interest  considering the complexity of the requirement and the short amount of time required to complete the effort.  The phase-in/phase-out time required if a new Contractor was selected to conduct this work would significantly delay the critical research due to unfamiliarity of the current status of obtained research.   With the overall PoP of the extension being two (2) months, a phase-in/phase-out period of another contractor would take up a large portion of this time.  Also, it would not be cost effective (due to start-up costs, manning issues, such as recruitment and relocation fees, and transferring the contract from one Contractor to another), nor realistic, to expect another Contractor to perform this work during the brief interim period to pick up the level of research at full scale that Engility Corporation can provide in order to  complete the effort.</p>
<p>If this LSJ is not approved, there is a high likelihood of critical mission failure because of how far along the current Contractor has come during the original PoP.  This research could be compromised if another Contractor is required to complete the work that Engility Corporation has conducted over the past five (5) years.<br />6. Actions to Increase Competition: Based on information provided in paragraph five (5) above, competition for this action is not feasible as no other source is capable of providing seamless support; however any future service contract requests will include new market research for the services required. This will include posting a sources sought synopsis as a mechanism to expose the requirement and determine if any new companies have gained access to, or expanded their expertise in developing and demonstrating the advanced robotics technology necessary to create unmanned ground vehicle systems for the Army's Future Force. In addition to the market research noted in section 7, the Government will continue to search the internet and GSA website to locate other potential sources for developing and demonstrating the advanced robotics technology necessary to create unmanned ground vehicle systems.</p>
<p>7. Market Research: Market Research was completed by REDACTED, with 12 years of experience. Market research was conducted during June 2017 by reviewing pricing and services of similar GSA companies and calculating the essential time and costs needed to train personnel in advanced robotics technology in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(vi).  Market Research concluded that Engility Corporation is the only logical awardee for this modification so that there is no stoppage of mission critical research.  Having another Contractor complete the additional work required to complete the research would be detrimental to ARL-VTD's mission due to the lead time that would be required to have the new Contractor produce the amount of data requiredin the specific research area of advanced robotics technology.</p>
<p>8. Other Facts: <br />a. Procurement History</p>
<p>(1)	Contract numbers and dates of the last several contracts for these same requirements:  W911QX-12-F-0025 awarded on 25 May 2012; PoP 01 June 2012 - 30 September 2017</p>
<p>(2)	The competitive status of these actions: Competitive</p>
<p>(3)	Authority previously cited if less than full and open competition was used: N/A</p>
<p>(4)	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results: N/A</p>
<p>(5)	If any prior contract for this requirement was accomplished using full and open competition, include a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances causing this action to now limit the sources: The research being conducted during the original PoP of the base contract was not completed prior to its expiration.  An extension of three (3) months is required to complete the research initiated under the base contract. Due to the extensive experience the Contractor obtained while conducting the research, it is logical for the Government to continue the effort with the current Contractor in order for the research to be completed timely and accurately.</p>
<p>(6)	An explanation of any unusual patterns that may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys: N/A</p>
<p>(7) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the procurement and whether there have been any significant changes: N/A</p>
