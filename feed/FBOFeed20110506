<DESC><strong>BATTLEFIELD AIR OPERATIONS (BAO) INTEGRATED CABLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ICMS) <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) </strong>
<p>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Battlefield Airmen Branch (WISN), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is soliciting information to identify possible sources to provide information on production or near production ready pieces of an ICMS (Integrated Cable Management System). This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.</p>
<p>2. ICMS is a conceptual philosophy that can be applied to all of the warfighter's wearable pieces of equipment that act as a platform for other equipment. Connectivity across the operator's body-worn components is necessary for data transfers, communication and power distribution. The use of the ensemble must be designed to operate and improve operators' function globally. Respondents to this RFI should describe their ability to provide a lightweight tactical vest, ruck, and load carriage that gets cables and connections out of the way of the user, thus reducing Tangled Operator Syndrome (TOS). Three distinct wear-zones should be considered for ICMS: 1) Zone-I, Torso-Area 2) Zone-II, Helmet 3) Zone-III, Rucksack/backpack. (For a description of these items, see Attachment 1).</p>
<p>3. This design philosophy should be adaptable and modular to scale down or up to any load-out or set of equipment. Risks associated with production, material availability and cost should be highlighted to better understand the applied approach. Responses do not need to address all of the items mentioned in Attachment 1, but those that do will have greater weight in shaping follow on efforts.</p>
<p>4. This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the BAO kit. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>5. When submitting a response to this RFI, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as organic AF personnel.</p>
<p>6. Responses are limited to 10 pages and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>7. Broad industry participation for this RFI is encouraged. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this ICMS RFI. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on Fed Biz Opps (FBO), unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company's response. Post submittal one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated.</p>
<p>8. This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available. Please check the FBO site for updates to this announcement and register to receive e-mail notices of any updates to the FBO announcement. For more information this RFI, please contact the AF POCs below. E-mail communications preferred.</p>
<p>9. Submissions are requested within 30 days of this announcement and may be submitted via e-mail or by mailing your response to:</p>
<p>Ms. Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer<br />ASC/WISK (Bldg 46, 1895 5th St) <br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233<br />Contracting Officer, nancy.leggett@wpafb.af.mil,</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), Dust Control, Ventilation and Toxic Substances Control Branch (DCVTSCB) have intent to issue a purchase order to RJ Lee Group, Inc. for Bulk Sample Analysis of Limestone Rock Dust Samples.<br /><br />Background and Scope:
<p>The Dust Control, Ventilation, and Toxic Substances Control Branch of NIOSH will serve as the conduit for the characterization of the pulverized limestone and/or other inert material used to dampen the explosive potential of coal dust in underground mines. The characterization will involve determining the silica content of a bulk material sample. A total of 260 rock dust samples will be received from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) over the course of 12 months. The contractor will accurately determine the free silica and combined silica content (by weight) of the sample using combined X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis techniques. The NIOSH 7500 method of XRD testing and Semi-Quant Chemical Composition (Fusion Prep) method of XRF testing are required for this analysis. As the samples are received, they will be delivered to the contractor for analyses. The analysis provided will identify the sample, state the amount of crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite) in percent by weight, and amount of the total or combined silica amount in each bulk sample provided. A turnaround time of 10 to 15 days will be required for sample results from the date of each delivery. For cost and expediency considerations, a local (Pittsburgh area) vendor is required for this work so that when samples are received a NIOSH employee can deliver them to the contractor. The contractor must be accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).</p>
<p>MSHA will collect the samples and deliver them to the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory to be analyzed for crystalline and combined silica content. Two analyses are required to accurately determine the silica content of the material, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). RJ Lee Group, Inc. is a materials characterization and analytical service laboratory in Monroeville, PA. This company not only performs both methods of analyses, but uses the preferred NIOSH 7500 method of XRD testing and Semi-Quant Chemical Composition (Fusion Prep) method of XRF testing. RJ Lee is accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and has performed timely and error free sample analysis for past NIOSH research studies. Several MSHA samples have already been tested to determine the need for comprehensive testing of samples nationwide. These initial samples were analyzed by RJ Lee. Therefore, to have valid, comparable, and reliable results for the completion of the study, it would be beneficial to use this company to accomplish this task in order to provide continuity of this overall effort.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13432. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with RJ Lee Group, Inc., 350 Hockberg Road, Monroeville, PA 15146-1516 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<CONTACT>Rachel E Johnson, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-382-7847, Fax 202-382-7854, Email rjohnson@bbg.gov
<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent Federal entity that is responsible for U.S.-funded non-military international broadcasting. BBG oversees, through an umbrella organization called the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), the Voice of America (VOA), and Radio and TV Marti (referred to collectively as the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB)). VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC. OCB is located in Miami, FL.
<p>The upcoming BBG International Audience Research Program (IARP) Request for Proposal (RFP) will seek potential contractors to provide analytics of BBG's international audience in order to support BBG's mission. It is estimated that the annual total amount of Task Orders to be issued under the planned contract will fall within the $5M - $10M price range.</p>
<p>BBG intends to award a Performance-Based IDIQ contract under which it will issue Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders. In a Performance-Based IDIQ contract, the Government specifies requirements in terms of performance objectives, and the Contractor(s) proposes 'how to' best satisfy those objectives. FFP Task Orders involving field research, other significant direct costs or subcontracts will be issued. Attached is a Draft Statement of Work (SOW) provided for initial industry feedback by Friday, May 20, 2011. While industry comments are welcome on the entire Draft SOW, specific attention should be given to the following sections:</p>
<p>1. Type of Contract (C.3.1)<br />2. Contract Task Areas (C.3.3)<br />3. Data Collection/Fieldwork, Data Processing, Quality Control (C.3.3)<br />4. Data Analysis, Reporting (C.3.3)<br />5. Media Consulting (C.3.3)<br />6. Customized Web-Based Data Portal (C.3.3)<br />7. Management Capacity (C.3.4)<br />8. Quality Assurance/Quality Control (C.3.4)<br />9. Anticipated Changes to the Current Research Program (Addenda)</p>
<p>One or more awards of IDIQ Contracts will be made based upon a combination of BBG's evaluation of technical and price proposals that represent best value to the Government. After awards are made, Individual Task Orders will be competed and issued on a FFP basis. Price proposals (submitted for each Task Order) will be required to include the FFP for tasks and possibly detailed labor rates, overhead, general and administrative, percentage fee and all loads applied to both labor and other direct costs. Please note that if BBG elects to make only one award, non-competitive pricing will be performed.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that each contract will have a one year base ordering period with (4) one year option ordering periods. The final RFP will have a new solicitation number.</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice. The final IARP RFP is currently estimated to be posted on FedBizOpps within 3-6 weeks from after receipt of feedback and will have a will have a new solicitation number. However, this date is dependent upon review and possible incorporation of comments received on the attached Draft SOW.</p>
<p>BBG will not consider corporate qualifications, capability statements, marketing material or any other proposal elements from interested parties at this time. BBG will consider industry comments on the content of the attached SOW only. For example, responders may comment on the feasibility, clarity or suggested alternative approaches to any element of the SOW.</p>
<p>Email all comments and feedback for the attached Draft SOW directly to the Contracting Officer at: rjohnson@bbg.gov</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Single Source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to SAAB Support and Services LLC, 21300 Ridgetop Cir Ste 1, Sterling, VA 20166-6520 with an estimated ceiling amount of $3 million.
This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
Purpose of the Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), Paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures.
The FAA intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for SAAB 2000 aircraft parts, overall, repair, maintenance, and technical services for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Group (AMEG). 
The FAA has made a single source determination insofar that SAAB support and services LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The FAA regards the critical operational nature of these items paramount to public safety. Procuring directly through the OEM is the most efficient way to procure requirements for the aircraft due to certification requirements and time constraints (realize improved lead time). In addition, the technical support uses OEM proprietary engineering data. Pricing will be based on the current commercial catalog prices of the vendor and terms provided to the firm's "most favored customer". A competitive solicitation is not available for the procurement. 
Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed in writing to Monica Rudolph, Contract Specialist, by 4:00 PM CST, May 13th, 2011, via email at monica.rudolph@faa.gov 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred and associated with any response to this announcement.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a sole source solicitation to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon), 225 Presidential Way, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-1060 to manufacture and deliver up to two (2) AN/TPY-2 Radars. The solicitation requirements will also include: initial spares for each AN/TPY-2 Radar system, March Order and Emplacement Trainers, a Radar Support Trailer, deployment package equipment, and options for Radar components to support fleet refurbishment and technical data. Radars are required to be delivered not later than 3QFY14 and 4QFY14.
<p>The proposed acquisition will be sole source to Raytheon pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) as the resulting contract is for highly specialized supplies and services where it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays of the requirement. Raytheon has developed and manufactured seven AN/TPY-2 radars (with an eighth currently in production) as either the primary subcontractor for radar production on the THAAD Development contract (DASG60-00-C-0072) or as the prime sole-source contractor on the BMDS Radar contract (HQ0006-03-C-0047). No other company has manufactured the AN/TPY-2 radar or integrated the radar for operations in a forward-based or THAAD weapon system configuration. Only Raytheon is capable of such manufacturing and integration without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's delivery requirements.</p>
<p>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact Raytheon, Ms. Kathryn Beadle, Contract Manager 339 645-1186. Point of contact for the Missile Defense Agency is Mr. Ritchie Vinson, MDA/DACX 256 450-1450.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, within 15 days after publication of this notice which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Attocube Systems, of Germany for the purchase of an Attocube Nanopositioning System, under other than full and open competition. NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination. (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in - (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) Sole Source determination is based on the following:
<p>The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) supports the U.S. nanotechnology enterprise from discovery to production by providing industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies with access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technology. The CNST is the only national nanocenter with a focus on commerce.</p>
<p>The CNST's shared-use NanoFab gives researchers economical access to and training on a state-of-the-art tool set required for cutting-edge nanotechnology development. Looking beyond the current state of the art, CNST research is creating the next generation of nanoscale measurement instruments and methods, which are made available through collaboration.</p>
<p>NIST's CNST Division currently owns an existing system which consists of three (3) Attocube Steppers and Controllers. The purchase of the Nanopositioning System from Attocube is essential to ensure compatibility with the existing system; in addition, NIST has invested an extensive amount of hours and funds in the development of software, based on LabView routines provided by Attocube Systems. This software is designed and customized for specific applications within the CNST. It would be detrimental to the Government if another manufacturer's system was purchased, as it would not provide 100 percent compatibility with the existing systems and customized software. Attocube Systems is the sole distributor and manufacturer of its equipment and accompanying software.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by Friday May 20, 2011 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6079, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), Oncogenomics Section plans to procure the brand name Fluidigm Access Array system manufactured by Fluidigm Corporation, 7000 Shoreline Court, Suite 100, South San Francisco, CA 94080.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard in 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>With the advance of different sequencing projects performed in the Pediatric Oncology Branch, the Oncogenomics Section urgently needs a completely different technology to validate findings such as a panel of genes or genomic features important to the target disease from these high-throughput sequencing projects. The ideal system has to have the following features: (1) high accuracy; (2) the use of technology fundamentally different from the existing next-generation sequencing platforms used by the Oncogenomics Section, including SOLiD (Applied Biosystems) and Genome Analyzer (Illumina); (3) detection of variant sequences from mixed sequences, even at low frequencies; (4) fast assay speed; (5) affordable running cost.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition<br /></strong>1. Statutory authority: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source.<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p><br />After researching the market for targeted re-sequencing technology, the Oncogenomics Section identified that the Access Array System by Fluidigm, paired with the Personal Genome Machine by Ion Torrent meets these criteria. Because of the speed and simplicity of the technology and design, Access Array is a fast, simple, and thus cost-effective platform for sequencing validation in the Oncogenomics Section.</p>
<p>The Oncogenomics Section has an additional need for an accurate way to quantify the nucleic acid libraries used for SOLiD sequencers. The current Applied Biosystem's ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System is outdated and uses a large amount of reagents (50u1) for each PCR reaction, resulting in high running costs. The Access Array system uses fewer reagents (&lt;1u1) for each PCR reaction, making it a less expensive option. In addition, ABI 7000 system gives relative concentrations, while the Access Array system gives an absolute concentration measurement, making the quantification more accurate.</p>
<p><br /><strong>The following salient characteristics apply to the Access Array system:<br /></strong>1. Targeted sequencing which allows the user to select a specific region of interest in the genome, permitting the user to sequence only that region instead of the entire genome, reducing cost and run time.<br />2. The use of microfluidics to facilitate parallel amplification of 48 ampl icons in 48 unique samples.<br />3. PCR incorporating sequencing adaptors that enable the preparation of a sequencing library concurrently with the preparation for PCR, which drastically reduces sample preparation time for sequencing.<br />4. Patented microfluidics technology which results in accurate and consistent data for PCR and quantification.</p>
<p>Because Fluidigm Corp. is the only manufacturer for the Fluidigm Access Array system and they own patents on the instrumentation design and technology, Fluidigm is the only source from where we can purchase the Access Array system.</p>
<p><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Delivery Date: 90 days from date of award.<br /><br />A Spectramax M5-R is a UV-visible microplate reader providing ultrafast, full spectral range detection for various sample formats including cuvettes, 96-well and 384-well microplates, with the only temperature-independent method for path length correction. Fluorescence polarization is necessary for projects involving FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assays, identifying interactive partners in signaling networks, which are primary technology to be utilized in NCI's quantitive proteomics laboratory.<br /><br />The following salient characteristics apply to the SpectraMax&reg; M5 Plate Reader:<br /><br />&bull; Fluorescence polarization capability- necessary for projects involving FRET assays; fluorescence polarization measurements provide information on molecular orientation and mobility and processes that modulate them, including receptor-ligand interactions, protein-DNA interactions, proteolysis, membrane fluidity and muscle contraction. Because polarization is a general property of fluorescent molecules, polarization-based readouts are somewhat less dye dependent and less susceptible to environmental interferences such as pH changes than assays based on fluorescence intensity measurements alone. <br /><br />&bull; Monochromator reading function- (non filter based) allows adjustable excitation/emission wavelengths which are desirable for standardizing the optimal wavelength required for different assays. <br /><br />&bull; PMTs/auto PMT function- multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for detection flexibility in a wide variety of assays; an automatic PMT electronic calibration systems avoid saturation of PMTs for accurate sample recording. <br /><br />&bull; Path length measurement technology-measures optical depth of samples with no temperature-dependency that could affect sample concentration measurements<br /><br />The Molecular Devices Spectramax M5 Plate reader is the only known product with all the characteristics listed above. The Spectramax M5 Plate reader fulfills the NCI's requirements and scientific options integral to the research, specifically the patented PathCheck sensor which is not affected by temperature and requires no accessories to measure the path length of the sample in each individual microplate well. The sensor on this microplate reader enables the ability to calculate concentrations without a standard curve, test liquid handling devices, detect and correct for pipetting errors and expand the dynamic range of the assay.<br /><br />Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov or fax (301) 402-4513 by May 23, 2011 11:00 am.

<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to WorldViz LLC, 27 West Anapamu Street, Suite 101-121, Santa Barbara, California 93101 to procure Vizard custom graphics and programming to create a virtual environment.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Office of Director, Social and Behavioral Research. NHGRI plans a research project that will begin building an evidence base on the benefits or pitfalls of introducing genetic information into weight-related primary care encounters. In particular interest in how this information will impact patients' health-related attitudes, beliefs and behavior, and patient perceptions of stigmatization. Furthermore, this project aims to determine whether a physician's patient-centered approach to the health care encounter will mitigate potential negative consequences or amplify potential positive consequences of genetic information provision. In order to achieve these aims, NHGRI will need to simulate an encounter between a doctor and a patient. We have chosen to do so using immersive virtual environment technology because it excels at simulation of complex environments while allowing manipulation of any facet of an environment including environmental characteristics and user representations and very exact measurement opportunities. In the virtual environment that is being procured, study participants will interact with a virtual reality doctor avatar in a clinic setting. There is no existing virtual environments developed that can meet our requirements for this research study.</p>
<p>Currently, a virtual reality hardware and software system is already in place for this project. WorldViz created the existing virtual environment that will serve as a base for the new environment. The custom graphics and programming being purchased is compatible to run with Vizard Software platform products that were created by WorldViz. WorldViz has the knowledge of the product and the ability to make required modifications as needed by WorldViz licensed technicians. To use any other software or hardware from another source on this project would be detriment to the research study.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ, intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with FirstMark Aerospace Corporation, for the procurement of Five (5) each Compass Calibrators, P/N 2591553-901.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. The Compass Calibrator is used to align/ calibrate the Standby Compass without removing the Compass from the aircraft. The Compass Calibrator cancels the earth's field at the Standby Compass and adds a standard magnetic field which can be rotated to simulate aircraft direction. Therefore, Compass error can be determined without physically rotating the aircraft via conventional airborne or ground swinging processes, allowing for Compass alignment in a quicker and less expensive manner. The Compass Calibrator consists of a base assembly, a knob assembly, and a magnet assembly. It is mounted to the aircraft's Standby Compass via the mounting bracket, and is housed in a metal case for storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Use of this item for calibration is referenced in the Air Force's KC10 Aircraft maintenance manual which outlines correct calibration procedures and identifies equipment that must be used. It is specially machined to interface with the aircraft's standby compass. FirstMark Aerospace is the original manufacturer and the only company approved to meet government design specifications. They own the proprietary rights to the technical data and detailed product drawings.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The point of contact is Michael T. Miller - michael.t.miller7@navy.mil.</p>

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, intends to purchase AN/USQ-82(V) Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System (GEDMS) hardware and INCO repair from one of two qualified vendors:  The Boeing Company or DRS Defense Solutions, LLC.
 Boeings address is 5301 Bolsa Ave, Huntington  Beach, CA 92647-2048. DRS address is 7600 Wisconsin Ave, Ste 1000, Bethesda, MD 20814-3657. Competition is limited to these two qualified manufacturing sources as the time and expense to qualify additional vendors is too prohibitive. GEDMS is a Government Furnished Equipment build-to-print system, where no commercially adequate products satisfy the design requirements. It is not a performance-based militarized commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system design, although there are performance based COTS components. All items shall be in compliance with NAVSEA system specifications DMS 500.7 and GEDMS 300.0 and will be listed in the solicitation that will follow this announcement.
 Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing and DRS directly. Delivery, inspection, and acceptance shall likewise be identified in the solicitation. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or around 1 July 2011 and will be open for 30 calendar days. Contract award will be no later than 30 September 2011. Any questions regarding this synopsis should be addressed to Candi Thomas at Candice.Thomas@navy.mil.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to Johnson Centrifugal Technology, Saukville, WI. for a procurement of two (2) complete Bearing Housing assemblies and one (1) set of Fasteners.
 All components are SUBSAFE/MIC Level I.  Johnson Centrifugal Technology is the only manufacturer who has NAVSEA approved inspection procedures and is the sole manufacturer of the Bearing Housing assemblies. Since the requirement is for only two assemblies with no anticipated future procurements it is not cost effective to the government for a new supplier to attempt to produce the assemblies.  The vendor would have to expend non-recurring engineering costs, tooling costs and first article destructive testing costs in order to produce the forged and cast material as well as add substantial costs in government procedure reviews and labor.  The anticipated posting date of solicitation N66604-11-R-2785 is on or about 07-Jun- 2011.
  The proposed contract action is for materials for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. For information on this acquisition please contact Neil Santos at 401-832-4827 or e-mail at neil.santos@navy.mil.

<SOLNBR>SOL-DC-11-00006
<RESPDATE>032211
<CONTACT>Christine Edwards

<a href="mailto:Edwards.Christine@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for a new mission support contract to provide laboratory assay and related scientific technical support for the EPA Office of Science Coordination and Policy (OSCP).  Specifically, support is required in validating laboratory assays under the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP).
This is NOT a solicitation.  This is a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2--Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.
The proposed requirement mentioned herein will be solicited as a full and open competition.  The successful offeror shall be prepared to provide scientific/technical support for EPA activities in furtherance of the Agency's primary mission--the protection of human health and the environment.  The work to be performed under the Statement of Work (SOW) falls under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a Small Business Size Standard of $7 million.  A draft SOW is posted on the following webpage:  
http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1110235/draftsow.pdf
In order to be awarded a contract under this requirement, the contractor must be able to meet the requirements, as stated in the SOW under the provided NAICS code.
Following this notice, and in response to the eventual publication of a solicitation, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.
The proposed acquisition is valued at approximately $25 million.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) time and materials contract, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15--Contracting by Negotiation.  The Government also intends to include clauses in the contract which will allow for tasks to be ordered and issued on a fixed price basis, whenever deemed appropriate.
These services are currently provided by the incumbents, Battelle Memorial Institute and Research Triangle Institute (RTI), under EPA multiple award IDIQ contracts EPW06025 and EPW06026, respectively.  Additionally, Battelle Memorial Institute currently provides the technical support services of this requirement as a separate contract, numbered EPW06032, where work is ordered via work assignments.  It is the Government's intent to award a multiple award, IDIQ contract in which all work will be ordered through the issuance of task orders, which will include technical support services.
Notwithstanding the Government's option to exercise term extensions, the current contracts listed above are scheduled to expire 1 September 2011.
The resultant contract is anticipated to have a 12-month base period and the possibility of four (4), 12-month option periods.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, and equipment necessary to perform the tasks as stated in the SOW.
The point of contact (POC) for this notice is Stefan Martiyan, Contract Specialist, who is to be contacted via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.

<DESC>Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order
Technical Support and Data Analysis for RARE Project "Estimating soil and house dust ingestion through the blood lead: soil/dust lead relationship at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in the Silver Valley, Idaho"
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to award a sole source purchase order to TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering, Inc. for the following requirement: 
The U.S. EPA?s National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) in the Office of Research and Development seeks to obtain to support services for the Regional Applied Research Effort (RARE) Region 10 project to estimate soil and house dust ingestion through the blood lead:soil/dust lead relationship at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site (BHSS) in Silver Valley, Idaho.  
The tasks set forth in this statement of work requires a technical consulting firm in possession of archived soil and dust samples from the BHSS and with the capability of linking soil and dust samples to confidential children?s blood lead levels. The contractor will also need an exceptionally high level of expertise to conduct data analyses using the IEUBK model to obtain soil and dust ingestion rates from RBA data, and soil and dust lead concentrations, and blood lead levels.  The responsible source identified for this project is TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering, Inc. (TerraGraphics). TerraGraphics is uniquely qualified as the primary contractor to the State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality for providing technical oversight assistance on the BHSS for over 20 years. They currently retain archived soil and dust samples from the BHSS that can be linked to children?s blood lead levels through a confidential database that they established and currently manage in support of ongoing cleanup activities and an Institutional Control Program. They have an exceptionally high level of expertise in use of the IEUBK model for risk assessment and clean-up evaluation of the BHSS. Dr. Ian von Lindern is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TerraGraphics and has worked for the State of Idaho on various projects involving the Bunker Hill/Coeur d?Alene Basin Superfund Site for over thirty years as the lead Risk Assessor. In that capacity he had ex tensive experience and therefore uniquely qualified in applying exposure and biokinetic lead modeling in assessing human health risk, developing cleanup criteria and remedial design. He is currently the Senior Project Manager implementing the human health cleanup at the Idaho Superfund Site. Dr. von Lindern has served as a U.S. EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) Member on five occasions.




NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any organization who believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirements as stated herein may contact the POC.  Responses to this notification are solely within the direction of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Marshand Boone via e-mail at boone.marshand@epa.gov by 05/13/11.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>FY 2011 FUNDING SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AT THE TIME OF AWARD.
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for the DHS OPERATIONS CENTER (DOC) contract for the Consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, DC. The scope will include the build out construction of the building (approx. 182,000 gsf).</p>
<p>This project is part of the first phase in a multiphase construction project that will construct a new office campus for the DHS at St. Elizabeths. The St. Elizabeths site is approximately 176 acres and is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) site containing primarily office space and parking structures with some special buildings for conferences and food service, located one mile east of DC on Martin Luther King Boulevard, is the former St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Three phases are planned in total, with a phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 - new construction for the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (USCG) (1,179,500 gsf) [awarded September 2009] Adaptive reuse of historic buildings for DHS at 179,250 gsf [awarded September 2010]; Phase 2 - The Center Building for DHS (265,000 gsf), the DHS Operations Center, and FEMA Headquarters (750,000 gsf) and Phase 3 - a combination adaptive reuse and new construction for Customs (ICE) and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and DHS (1.4 million gsf).</p>
<p>The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements. The contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract. The estimated construction cost range is between $35 - 60 million. The Construction Performance Period shall be phased, with the Base contract not exceeding 480 days. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3. The contract will be Firm Fixed Price. The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price. The Technical Evaluation Factors are:</p>
<p>1. EXPERIENCE : The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) similar projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor considers the extent of the Offeror's past performance with reference to such aspects as costs, timeliness, and technical success as part of the consideration.</p>
<p>3. KEY PERSONNEL: This factor considers the qualifications of the key personnel proposed by the offeror to execute the contract requirements for the positions proposed.</p>
<p>4. MANAGEMENT PLAN &amp; SCHEDULE : This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.</p>
<p>5. SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN: This factor addresses the evaluation of the extent of participation of small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns in performance of the contract in the authorized NAICS Industry Subsector.</p>
<p>6. Labor/Trade APPRENTICESHIP and TRAINING PROGRAM: The Government will evaluate the means by which the Offeror shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration will only make this RFP available electronically at www.FBO.gov. GSA intends to upload the RFP at this site on or about June 10, 2011. This site provides instructions for downloading the RFP. In accordance with the requirements of the RFP, all proposals will be submitted to GSA in July of 2011 to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPY) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 and the Size Standard is $31.5 million. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business concerns. However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Small Disadvantaged Women Owned Businesses and are encouraged to submit a technical proposal and so state that they are SDBs and Woman Owned. All responsible sources may submit a technical proposal package, which will be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Executive Order 11246 prohibits employment discrimination by federal contractors and subcontractors, and federally assisted construction contractors and subcontractors, and authorizes the Secretary of Labor to administer and enforce the Order. Similarly, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities by federal contractors and subcontractors, and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 U.S.C. 4212) prohibits employment discrimination against covered veterans by federal contractors and subcontractors. Through its Public Buildings Service, GSA awards construction contracts, and works with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to ensure compliance with the requirements of 41 CFR Part 60-4. This Initiative furthers the goals of providing equal employment opportunity (EEO) and affirmative action in the construction industry, as well as creates joint public outreach activities.<br /><br />Based on the interagency initiative between OFCCP and GSA, OFCCP will provide technical assistance during pre-solicitation, pre-bid, post-award, and pre-construction conferences to contractors. OFCCP will participate in preliminary meetings with appropriate officials from GSA prior to the selection of the general contractor on mega construction projects in order to ensure that bidders are aware of their EEO obligations if they are awarded a federal contract.<br /><br />Therefore, the successful offeror of this project and its subcontractors are required to attend a mandatory Compliance Assistance Training, which is held on a regular basis here on the Campus. In addition, the successful offeror is expected to participate in routine meetings regarding the status of outreach efforts on the project.</p>

<p>Purpose: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IAW FAR 15.201(e). This notice is solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this Request For Information (RFI) and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry on establishing sustainment and enhancement activities for the Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) system by gaining knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (small business, large business, etc.) The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms, and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for possible future acquisitions. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation because one does not exist.</p>
<p>Request for Information/Questions: The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).</p>
<p>FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly information system.</p>
<p>In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:</p>
<p>1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated transition time to provide the service<br />3. Service delivery options (i.e., provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)<br />4. Possible peripheral or allied support required from the government.<br />5. What performance metrics could be made available to the government related to usage?<br />6. Any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />7.

<DESC>Engine Water Wash <br />Industry Day Notification<br />(Follow up to RFI FA8124-11-R-0010)
<p>This Industry Day Notification is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.</p>
<p>Description of services</p>
<p>The Air Force requires engine turbine water wash services at 34 CONUS bases and 2 OCONUS bases (i.e., Eielson AFB, AK and Hickam AFB, HI. Initially, the Air Force will focus wash service on F108-100 (KC-135), F108-201 (T/RC-135), TF39 (C-5), and TF33-103 (B-52), TF33-5/9 (O/WC-135), TF33-100 (E-3B), TF33-102C (E-8) engines with expansion to other pylon-mounted engines (e.g. F134 (C-5). The annual wash rate is expected to be approximately 1,000 engines for all engines at the associated aircraft main operating base or the respective maintenance location (i.e., isochronal maintenance, phase inspections, and program depot maintenance (PDM)).</p>
<p>An Engine Water Wash consists of a closed loop, on-wing engine water wash to adhere with environmental regulations at the aforementioned 36 USAF bases. Water solution used must not harm the engine, nor leave any substantial residue (e.g. de-ionized solution). The vendor will perform the wash at the CONUS USAF bases with minimal support from base resources (material and manpower). The wash system must be mobile to avoid aircraft movement and able to wash 4 engines within a 4 hour period. The wash is expected to reach the turbine area of the engine, demonstrate no adverse effects to an engine at start up speed, effectively clean the turbine area, leave no residual, and gather all residual debris from the wash.</p>
<p>Government will provide access to the aircraft, prepare engine for wash and post wash requisites. USAF crews will open cowl doors, perform any aircraft mechanical preparation required for engine wash, motor engine for engine wash process, perform post-engine wash ground run, as required to dry engine, close cowl doors, and restore engine to operating condition per applicable aircraft procedures. The vendor will provide all manpower and equipment to accomplish an engine water wash.</p>
<p>Industry Day Details</p>
<p>Industry Day will be held at the General James E. Hill Conference Center on Tinker AFB, OK, 6 June 2011 from 0800 to 1100. "One-on-One" Contractor/Government sessions are offered from 1200 to 1600. During the main/morning session the government will provide briefing on the acquisition strategy, water wash concepts of operations, and expectations. Requests for attendance and for "one-on-one" scheduling must be sent to the water wash&nbsp;Contracting Officers Susan Cockrell or Alan Lee (See below contact information)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Information Request</p>
<p>The government desires to learn from industry about engine wash standards, practices, contractual structure/arrangements, and recommended approach. This information can be provided via official letter to this office or during a "one-on-one" side session between the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center Propulsion Sustainment Division (OC-ALC/GKG).</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation but a request for information/interest. All responsible sources interested in providing services for this requirement are requested to provide a written summary of information concerning their technical certifications, capabilities, capacity, and experience. Additionally, background information will include current services or contracts, client portfolio with telephone numbers, and the company's 2010 annual report. Sources responding to this Industry Day must indicate, in writing, whether their business falls into one or more of these categories: large, small, disadvantaged, disabled, veteran-owned, or woman-owned business. This acquisition will fall under NAICS 336412 and its applicable size standard (1000 people). Responses would be limited to 25 pages or less.</p>
<p>Any information and attendance request submitted by respondents to this Industry Day notification is strictly voluntary. This Industry Day notification does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI. All responses and questions should be forwarded to the attention of Contracting Officers Susan Cockrell, (405)734-734-6995, email: susan.cockrell@tinker.af.mil or Alan Lee, (405) 734-6644, email: alan.lee@tinker.af.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>Natasha Boyce, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6128, Fax 202-245-6297, Email Natasha.Boyce@ed.gov - Pamela a Bone, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-245-6181, Fax 202-245-6297, Email pamela.bone@ed.gov
<DESC><p>Design and Conduct of Study of Implementation of Reauthorized Title I and Title II<br /><br />Background: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) in accordance with FAR 19.202-2. The potential small business will need to demonstrate the ability to provide an implementation evaluation of how states, schools, and districts are using Title I and Title II funds as well as looking at student outcome trends pre- and post-reauthorization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).</p>
<p>History: Title I and Title II were created as part of ESEA, which was originally enacted in 1965 to help provide all students with equal access to education. It was intended to ensure that all students meet certain standards, and in particular, assist those students with the lowest levels of achievement. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 expanded upon ESEA by increasing accountability through the use of assessments for students, requirements for all teachers to be highly qualified, and funding for supports and interventions for schools not achieving adequate yearly progress for the entire school population as well as for various subgroups of students.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 50,000 public schools use Title I funds to help low-achieving students increase achievement and meet state standards.<br /><br />Historically, there has been a Congressionally-mandated study of Title I which has also included information about Title II; this study is planned in anticipation of the upcoming reauthorization of ESEA. While the timeline for reauthorization is uncertain, reauthorization is overdue and could happen as early as within the next year. Based on the likely areas of concentration as signaled by the administration's publication "A Blueprint for Reform" (http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/blueprint.pdf) and ongoing reauthorization discussions, this study is designed to provide relevant baseline data prior to the reauthorization as well as follow-up data to evaluate the implementation of a reauthorized Title I and Title II. <br /><br />The contract will include the following requirements:<br /><br />1. Develop a strategy for obtaining a nationally representative sample of districts and schools from the universe of public school districts in the United States<br />2. Collect data through surveys, document reviews, and existing data<br />3. Conduct data analysis and prepare reports based on data collected as part of the Title I and Title II implementation study <br /><br />Please review attached Draft Performance Work Statement for further details of the requirement.<br /><br />Contractors must respond to all the following points, by indicating your experience and ability to provide the qualifications and experience of key staff, as well as related corporate experience and capacity, in each of the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Substantive knowledge of, and experience with, relevant education issues.<br />&bull; Experience and skill in managing, designing, and conducting evaluations of education programs of a similar nature. <br />&bull; Experience and skill in the development and administration of large-scale, multi-site national studies that involve state, district, school, and teacher surveys using complex survey sampling methodologies.<br />&bull; Experience in collecting and analyzing quantitative data from multiple states, districts, and schools.<br />&bull; Adequacy of time commitment and evidence of successful work in conducting previous studies of a similar nature.<br />&bull; No conflicts of interest (perceptions of bias or financial interest in the outcome of the study) that would call into question the independence of the study's findings.<br /><br />Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Natasha Boyce, Contract Specialist at Natasha.Boyce@ed.gov . CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Please address each requirement in the order listed above.<br /><br />Responses must be submitted not later than May 16, 2011. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date. Responses shall be limited to 6 pages (single-spaced, with a minimum of one-inch margins and 12 point font). Contractors should include resumes in the appendix (no more than 5 resumes shall be included and only resumes for key personnel that will work on the contract are to be included); these resumes will not be counted as one of the 6 pages of the capability statement. Resumes should not exceed 5 pages each.<br /><br />Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements shall include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.<br /><br />This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Department to award a contract. The sole intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain capabilities for set-aside and procurement planning purposes.<br /><br />Please provide the following Business information:<br /><br />1. DUNS Number<br />2. Company Name<br />3. Company Address<br />4. Company Point of Contact, phone number and email address<br />5. Type of company under NAICS, as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov.

Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.
<p><br />The U.S. Air National Guard's 109th Air Wing (AW) out of Scotia, New York supplies all medium and long range intra-continental airlift support for the USAP using the Lockheed LC-130 transport aircraft. The 10 LC aircraft are comprised of four NSF aircraft and six 109th AW aircraft operated and maintained by the Department of Defense for logistical support to the NSF in accordance with Presidential Memorandum 6646. These aircraft are Air Force configured. As such, they must be maintained per U.S. Air Force (USAF) standards and technical orders at USAF recognized/authorized depot-level repair facilities. During most years, the contractor will perform two PDMs plus the UDLM work. The UDLM work generally occurs during the USAP's operating season from October through February with the PDMs generally occurring during the austral winter.</p>
<p><br />Christchurch, New Zealand is the USAP's forward logistics and staging base from which all USAP LC-130 flights to the Antarctic continent originate. In order to maximize aircraft availability in the Antarctic theater, NSF requires ready access to UDLM facilities (see "Place of Performance"). Demonstrated proficiency in the maintenance and repair of the LC-130 airframe and the LC-130's unique ski system is required. Companies interested in performing this work must be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, and USAF approved for work on LC-130 aircraft. The FAA/USAF certification and approval are prerequisites to a USAP maintenance and repair contract.</p>
<p>Any interested firm should submit a written capability statement to include their experience in the maintenance and repair of LC-130 aircraft and/or LC-130 ski system. Vendors may express interest in a single part or any combination of the three parts of the work. Please do not submit any proprietary information in your capability statement.</p>
<p>Due to the limited time available for this market research, no questions concerning the potential requirement will be accepted.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall not exceed 15 pages in Microsoft Word 2003 and must be submitted to Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, pfranzel@nsf.gov, via e-mail, no later than May 18, 2011 by 1600 EDT. Only electronic submissions via email will be accepted; oral responses, hardcopy responses, and electronic responses provided on physical media are not acceptable.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>If and when a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizops.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO for release of any solicitation or synopsis.<br /><br /><strong>Place of Performance:<br /></strong>Place of performance for unscheduled drop-in depot level repair maintenance is a facility located in, or in close proximity to, Christchurch International Airport, Christchurch, New Zealand as a matter of practicality and turn-around time.<br /><br />The current place of performance for LC-130 PDM and LC-130 Ski System PDM is Christchurch International Airport, Christchurch, New Zealand; however, PDM at this location is not required.</p>

(telephone no. 671-339-2572)

Background:
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) Executive Order 13423 and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 direct Federal Agencies to dramatically increase the efficiency with which they use energy in facilities.  EISA requires that agencies reduce energy use by 30%, measured as BTUs per square foot of facilities by the year 2016.  In addition, EPAct requires that 7.5% of all Federal electrical consumption come from renewable sources by 2013.
  Finally, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 further requires that by 2025, 25% of all the energy consumed by the Department of Defense come from renewable sources and DoD policies place a premium on conservation efforts that reduce dependence on foreign petroleum fuels and employ renewable energy resources.  

In response to these energy policies, the Navy has aggressively investigated opportunities to expand its use of alternative energy technology and it was determined that Guam is a strong candidate for wind energy development due to its high utility rates and excellent wind resource.  In 2008, wind data studies were conducted at various sites in Guam and results of data supports good wind resource availability on the island.
  Site locations with best wind resource and economic returns identified.  NAVFACMAR is currently doing the Environmental Assessment on the project to analyze potential environmental consequences of the wind turbine project proposed in each site.

Wind Farm Project Criteria:
The project will establish a turnkey wind generation farm powered by identical wind turbines at preselected sites within Naval Base Guam.  Existing typical wind speed data appears to show a range of 6-8 m/s at the sites under consideration.  The biggest challenge we are encountering is finding manufacturers who produce wind turbine packages that can satisfy the Guam structural requirements as stated in UFC 3-301-01. The intent of the project is to produce an energy facility that has minimal impact on the environment and the public, is capable of constantly withstanding local inclement weather (e.g.
 basic wind design speed of 170 mph), requires minimal maintenance and troubleshooting, and maximizes return on investment. Furthermore, wind gust speeds at wind turbine heights that can result from typical Guam typhoons should be considered a design requirement. Structural integrity of all components must be maintained (e.g. tower and rotor must remain intact and firmly attached to the ground) in all typhoon conditions to ensure safety.  Potential damage from storms should be minimized.  For our economic analysis, we also request for a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost of such wind turbine packages, FOB Guam.  

In summary, request for information on the following:

1. Manufacturers who produce wind turbine packages that can satisfy Guam structural requirements as stated in UFC 3-301-01.
  Provide product information addressing ability to mitigate our structural, safety, and noise requirements to the fullest extent possible.  In the event of an earthquake or typhoon, the wind turbines will have been designed and constructed so that it will not increase the danger to the lives and properties to its immediate and outlying vicinity.

2. Provide data of wind turbine structures installed in areas similar to Guam (ie: extreme weather conditions, remoteness, etc.)  Provide historical data of life spans and structural failures if any.   
  
3. Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost of such wind turbine packages, FOB Guam.

We will consider all information submitted in response to this request for information.
 Any future acquisition will be conducted based on the needs of the Government at the time of the acquisition and the availability of funding. Participation in a demonstration project does not guarantee that the project will subsequently be the subject of a funded acquisition, nor does it necessarily give a vendor a more favorable position in any future procurement. However, since this is an area of rapidly developing technology, it is possible that a demonstration project could become a model for other installations or the Department of Defense.

Class Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition And Waiver of Publication Requirements: 41 USC 253(d)(1); FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The purpose of this procurement is to design, prepare, and facilitate a symposium and utilize existing networks to locate bat experts from around the world.
Justification and Approval DocumentFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUse for requirements not exceeding $100,000

1.  Contracting Activity:  Fish & Wildlife Service			       Division of Contracting & Grant Services			       Southeast Region, Atlanta, GA
2.  Description of Action:
     Requirement:	X  New 	0  Repeat     Pricing:		1  Firm-Fixed Price          0  Time & Materials	0  Cost
			Name of Intended Contractor:	Bat Conservation International     
Street Address:	Post Office Box 162603City, State, Zip:	Austin, Texas 78716Phone:	512-327-9721, www.batcon.org

3.  Description of Services:  The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 30,000.  Describe the services or supplies, including make & model number, to be acquired below.This contract will pay for a variety of actions associated with the 2011 White-Nose Syndrome Symposium scheduled to take place in Little Rock, Arkansas.  The contract will provide funding to Bat Conservation International (BCI) for general meeting planning coordination.  The contract will also provide funding to BCI to allow them to arrange and pay travel for invited speakers and other guests confirmed to attend the symposium (to be held from May 17-19, 2011).  BCI has worked in this capacity for the USFWS as recently as the July 2010 Captive Propagation Workshop held in St. Louis, MO. All BCI activities will be outlined in a final report to USFWS.   
4.  Authority Cited:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following.)
       (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements OR

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: (State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.)
      (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
     (d)  Additional Information:
	(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?The potential loss of large numbers of federal trust wildlife resources (bats).  White-nose syndrome (WNS) is responsible for the death of an estimated 1-2 million bats in the northeastern U.S., and is spreading rapidly through the rest of the Country.  This Symposium is needed to advance WNS research and management through communication, facilitated discussion, and collaboration.  BCI will play a critical role in this symposium by addressing general meeting planning assistance, as well as arranging and funding the travel needed to get key experts to Little Rock, Arkansas for the meeting.  

	(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?     We would not have time/staff resources to properly plan the symposium.  We would also have to handle travel of experts and invited guests on an individual basis, something that we presently do not have time/staff resources to do. The purpose of the symposium is to gather a group of white-nose syndrome experts together to draft a WNS national plan.  The experts will come from the US, Canada, and Europe.  The USFWS does not know all the key stakeholders across the globe.  Because BCI's mission is to conserve the world's bats and their ecosystems and because they are a leading bat conservation organization, they have the ability to locate the necessary stakeholders, biologists, and experts.  Their role will be to locate and arrange travel, provide planning support, and prepare a final report outlining the symposium activities.  Other event planning vendors do not have the specialize expertise to locate bat experts from around the world.  If BCI was not awarded the contract, the USFWS would not have the key stakeholders present at the symposium to draft the national plan.
6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)     None.  After discussion within the WNS workgroup planning the symposium, we decided that BCI was uniquely qualified to perform these tasks based on their level of bat expertise, their connections with the bat conservation community at home and abroad, their demonstrated success in assisting the USFWS with workshops and symposia, and their familiarity with White-nose syndrome.  
7.  Market Survey:  (Describe the extent of the market survey conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.  "Market Survey" is defined as those attempts you made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  The survey of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.)     The market survey consisted of discussing options within the WNS symposium workgroup (10 FWS biologists from 4 FWS regions).  We determined that BCI was uniquely qualified to perform the combination of travel arrangement and meeting planning.

<DESC>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."<br />&nbsp;
<p>a. Background, Purpose and Objectives. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Toxicology Program (NTP) is interested in having chemicals and complex mixtures screened for biological activity relevant to toxicity pathways in biochemical and cell-based in-vitro assays, in-vitro 3D tissue constructs, and/or those using phylogenetic lower organisms. The NTP, in its Roadmap for the 21st Century (http://ntp.niehs.gov/go/vision), established as a goal, the development of a high throughput screening program using rapid, predictive assays that have been demonstrated to be reliable and relevant for estimation of toxicity. The anticipated contract shall be independent of but may overlap assays conducted under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast Program (http://www.epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/data_sets.html). Development of new assays is not of interest for this requirement. Results from screening these assays will be used to identify and rank compounds of interest for further toxicity characterization.</p>
<p>b. Project requirements. The NTP requires contractor assistance in screening compounds in high throughput and/or high content biochemical or cell-based in-vitro assays, in-vitro 3D tissue constructs, and/or those using phylogenitic lower organisms. Each assay will be comprised of unique features in terms of molecular target, species, molecular or biochemical pathway, toxicity pathway, and conditions, and may include capability for metabolic activation. All assays will be extant and commercially available. New assay development is not intended for the contract anticipated. Representative examples of the types of assays that may be screened under this contract can be accessed at the EPA ToxCast Program Website identified above. The anticipated contract may include but is not limited to the assays specified.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is anticipated that the contract will require screening of up to 15 assays per year. Assay screening shall be initiated via issuance of individual Task Orders to the contract. Each assay may include between 20 minimum and 100 maximum chemicals. The NTP will provide the chemicals. Assay screening shall be conducted in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well plate format or some other agreed-to format for rapid assay performance at up to 10 treatment concentrations and 3 times of exposure. Each task order shall be processed and data results submitted to the COTR within 120 days of receipt of test chemicals. <br /><br />c. Anticipated contract type and period of performance. It is anticipated that the Government will make one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type award, and the award will contain fixed unit prices for each type of assay screening identified. Specifics for each assay screening shall be included in the individual Task Orders awarded. Since the Government will require data from a variety of assays, it is anticipated that the contractor may require the resources of multiple subcontractors to perform the requirements of the Statement Of Work. <br /><br />It is anticipated that the fixed unit price per type of assay screening shall be provided in single units (For example: assay X @ $YYY/each). It is anticipated that there may be up to a maximum quantity of fifteen (15) assays/year. Optional Quantities may be included in the contract to order additional assays in single units. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance shall be for one year 2012 through 2013 for the base year of the award, with four (4) one year options (2013 through 2017) for a total of five (5) years if all optional periods of performance are exercised. <br /><br />d. Other important considerations. Chemical compounds are to be treated as hazardous and potentially carcinogenic. The contractor, and/or subcontractor(s) if applicable, should have experience handling hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals safely and disposing of waste safely. The Principal Investigator (PI) should have adequate experience in preparing and managing data organization as demonstrated by an advanced degree in laboratory-based research programs and publication of scientific data, and analysis at a level for publication in peer-reviewed journals. It is preferred that the PI have experience with management of subcontractors, since it is anticipated that resources may be required of multiple subcontractors. Offerors should have a plan for QA/QC of all data acquired under the anticipated contract from in-house and/or subcontracted sources. It is anticipated that a final report shall be submitted upon the completion of each assay, and that semi-annual status reports will be required to document the on-going and future progress of the contract. <br /><br />e. Information sought. The NTP is seeking information from qualified organizations to provide the scientific and logistical expertise necessary to assist the NTP in conducting High Content Assays for Human and Rodent Toxicity Pathway Assays. <br /><br />In response to this announcement NTP requests:<br /><br />1. Opinions regarding the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement and/or proposed acquisition (such as contract type, pricing, etc.), possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts; <br />2. General information, which estimates the effort or time that may be required for an experienced organization to complete the work, identified above. Note: this information is for planning purposes only, DO NOT include detailed estimates;<br />3. Other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements;<br />4. Information packets should not exceed twenty (20) pages in length, excluding standard brochures. Telephone and facsimile responses will not be accepted. Electronic or hard-copy (4 copies) information packages are acceptable. Electronic information shall be in Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, Microsoft Power Point, or other Microsoft compatible format sufficient to clearly read the information provided;<br />5.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting. FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Contracting webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 
MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The United States Government (USG) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.
  The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) is facilitating this work effort, which is seeking information on existing Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or Government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) remotely operated Stabilized Small Arms Mount (SSAM) weapon systems for maritime usage.  
Specific areas of interest are provided as an attachment 1 to this announcement. 
Interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as white paper).  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages (exclusion of supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.), with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL), operational availability data, Reliability-Availability-Maintainability (RAM) data, and an estimation of cost including Life Cycle Costs (10 year estimates for annual preventative maintenance, repair, and component replacement parts cost).
  Cost estimates shall include, if applicable, any non-recurring engineering costs to retro-fit weapon system for maritime use, weapon system integration costs, as well as procurement costs with lead time for availability.  Interested sources should submit the white paper electronically or in hard copy to the Points of Contact (POCs) listed below. 

Information generated from this survey will be evaluated and may be used to support the decision for potentially funding a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program.  FCT focuses on rapidly fielding quality military equipment to improve the warfighters capabilities, while minimizing developmental and Life Cycle costs. 

This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.
  Responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  The Government may elect to visit, or host a visit, from any potential sources following the market survey.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.

All interested parties should provide the requested information regarding this announcement no later than 1400 EDT on or before 3 JUN 2011, at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.
  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of this announcement.  Submittals after this date will still be accepted, although there is no guarantee they will be evaluated.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new anticipated period of performance for this task order will be from February 5, 2010 through July 31, 2011 (it was previously scheduled to expire May 31, 2011). The primary objective of this task order remains the same which is to assist EPA Region II in providing management tools in the areas of sanitary sewage, watershed planning, and green infrastructure for the US Virgin Islands:<br />(a) The sources of fecal coliform pollution are difficult to determine. US Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) believes that failing septic systems contribute greatly to fecal coliform pollution. The task order will assist DPNR in investigating this possibility.<br />(b) Rainfall and observed data statistics would provide insight to longer range watershed planning.<br />(c) The Green Infrastructure task described in this Task Order is intended to target reduction in urban runoff and pollutant loadings by managing the runoff as close to its sources as possible.<br />The great majority of the work will be performed at the contractor's location in Watertown MA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

Ring Power is the factory authorized distributor for Caterpillar for the entire five state region of the Southeast United States, Zone 1.  The subject equipment is currently under warranty with Ring Power and the warranty would be void if service is provided by an unauthorized Caterpillar Zone 1 agent.  Any other service companies would have to get their parts, and use their technicians to be able to perform the services to factory specs.  Also, there is proprietary software in the computer controls of the generator system and any attempt at repairs would have to include access to that information via computer. 

The entire building, including the generator systems, is under warranty. The warranty for the generators is from Caterpillar, through the local dealer, Ring Power. The warranty states that all maintenance must be performed on the system to manufacturers recommendations. The warranty also specifies that the maintenance must be performed by an authorized dealer. Ring Power is the only authorized dealer for the local area. The generators are all microprocessor controlled, in that the entire control panel is computerized. In order to operate and maintain the generators and engines, a technician must connect a computer to the controller to access information on the unit, alarm settings, engine parameters, etc. This requires specific software to be installed on the computers that are connected to the generators. This software is proprietary, and only authorized Caterpillar dealers and their employees have access to it.  See attached memos from the manufacturer, Caterpillar, and their authorized dealer, Ring Power, Inc.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />Contracting Activity:USDA-ARS St Paul, Minnesota intends to Award as a Sole Source to Illumina. <br />Nature/Description of Action: Request for purchasing laboratory consumables for conducting genotyping experiments using the high throughput genotyping assay method developed by Illumina.<br />Description of Supplies/Service: <br />The chemical reagents included in the high density bead chip kit custom designed for conducting genotyping assays, known as Infinium assay, manufactured by Illumina.<br />Statutory Authority: In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and FAR 6.302-1.<br />Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: <br />A high density genotyping assay, known as the Infinium assay, developed by Illumina allows thousands of different DNA markers to be analyzed in 96 individuals in a single reaction assay, thus, permitting a large amount of data to be generated in a short period of time. The USDA-ARS laboratory in Fargo, ND has been using Illumina's reagents to perform similar genotyping experiments since 2006 with success. A set of 9000 wheat markers has been previously custom designed, and the Fargo lab has performed experiments using this set of markers on 1000 wheat samples so far with excellent results. We plan to use this set of 9000 wheat markers to genotype additional 384 wheat genotypes. The re-order of this marker set included in the high density bead chip kit along with other chemical reagents are manufactured by Illumina. Illumina is the sole manufacturer of the reagents. The equipment necessary to perform these assays is already available in the Fargo lab. The Fargo lab has already invested large amount of funds (~$300K) to equip our lab for conducting these assays. The Fargo lab requires no training on performing the Infinium assay system. Moreover, using the same assay system and marker design will provide us with the data consistency and allow cross comparison among different experiments generated at different time in the lab.<br />Determination of Fair and Reasonable Costs:    <br />The Illumina genotyping technique is designed for high throughput genotyping experiments.  The item stated in #3 will be used in the Fargo lab to conduct experiments and evaluated in the Illumina equipment to produce data in a large-scale. The cost for each assay using this method is at $60/sample, or less than one cent per data point, which is a very reasonable cost.<br />Market Survey:The item stated above is manufactured and custom made at Illumina. Illumina developed the Infinium assay method and, thus, is the sole manufacturer of these chemical reagents for the assay, and no substitute vendor is available.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Southeast Scientific Repair, Inc, 102 White Park Drive, Suite 500-B, Dallas, GA 30132 for continued maintenance coverage not to exceed 12 months for maintenance of 35 freezers, various Forma models (a variety of -70 and -20 freezers) and Sanyo freezers, as well as one Thermo Fisher freezer, at the MPIR laboratory at our Atlanta campus. Due to the perishable and irreplaceable serum from humans and animals stored in the freezers, it is necessary to employ a company which can provide same-day service when the equipment is not working properly. Vendor must be able to pass CDC&rsquo;s required background clearance and required safety testing to obtain CDC badge-access to our laboratory areas, and must have access and immediately respond to 24/7 alarm notification of freezer problems. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Technical capability of the item to meet the requirement
(ii)	Past Performance
(iii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors.
 (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable.
 Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating commercial product brochures, drawings and technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.
 Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance. A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction.
 Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. 
Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.
 Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.
The Governments required delivery date is clearly defined above.  Ability to meet the required delivery date and shipping terms shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required date and terms.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .

<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the Vice President for Finance and Administration of the University (VP for Finance and Administration) over the past five years.

There will be an administrative executive identified to work with the contractor selected and assist in coordinating the internal administrative support needed by the selected quote. The offeror is expected to develop a plan that will be reviewed by USUHS personnel prior to its execution. The outside contractor will then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the University President.</p>

USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

     (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.

     (7) The Standard Form 1449.
 
     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
 
     (9) The specification.
 
   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. OFDA's Office of the Director is responsible for management of OFDA's strategic relationship with international organizations and non-governmental organizations, leading external coordination efforts with traditional and non-traditional donors, leading efforts in humanitarian policy and humanitarian architecture work, setting the strategic direction for OFDA's work with multi-lateral organizations, and establishing OFDA policy on a range of humanitarian issues and managing global programs.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within DRM and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor is part of the Health Team in TAG.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The WASH Advisor is an integral part of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Health Team. OFDA addresses all disaster health risks with a strong focus on identifying and managing health risks in complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs). In natural and complex emergencies, excess mortality results from malnutrition, malaria, measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. HIV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to excess mortality in disasters. These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (children under five years of age, the elderly, and women). The team provides technical assistance to OFDA including assessments, proposal reviews, risk management, capacity building and technical innovations to address the major causes of excess morbidity and mortality. OFDA's water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions include hygiene education and promotion, establishment and/or rehabilitation of water sources such as hand dug wells, water testing, support for water user committees, sanitation intervention at household level, and environmental health activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor who will provide OFDA with technical assistance in program assessment and planning, strategy development and implementation, monitoring of WASH mitigation and response activities, and technical representation in worldwide forums and working groups.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Questions and Concerns with Solicitation VA-263-11-RP-0162:

Section B.3, Item 4. Documentation D. Contractor shall comply with any existing and new regulations regarding patient record keeping?  We are wondering what this may entail as this is for autopsy services?  This is not applicable.

Section B.3, Item 6. Applicable VA Directives and Handbooks: Both A. and B. is there anything different in the VA materials vs. what would normally take place with an autopsy?  The VA protocol for autopsies is consistent with private sector practice.  However, bidders should review procedures for recovery of pacemakers and or implantable defibrillators and procedures for the return or disposal of such items.    The reference is VHA Handbook 1106.1 (11.e).

Section B.4, Item 1. Contract Performance Monitoring: Parts B. and C. are these applicable and what type of training or inspections?  These assessments are performed by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative to verify the contractor is meeting the terms of the contract.

Section B.4, Item 2. Quality Assurances: Both A. and B. is this even applicable to autopsy services or was this intended for Physician Services?  Refer to the response to the question above.

Section B.4, Item 3. Qualifications: as in the immediate above, Part A. are these even applicable to this solicitation?   Change this to read simply  " Physicians assigned by the Contractor to perform the services covered by this contract shall be board certified in Anatomic Pathology and possess appropriate state licensure."

Section B.4, Item 4. Personnel Policy: Parts C., D., and E. Are these relevant to this solicitation?  Both individuals associated with this work are Board Certified.  Strike C, D and E.

Section B.4, Item 6. Contractor Personnel Security Requirements: Part D. Contractor Responsibilities items (1), (3), (7), (9) what needs to be done here?  If something needs to happen the VA will cover it?  This item is not applicable to this contract.

Section B.4, Item 7. Compliance Training Parts A. B. and C. I would question its relevance to this solicitation?  This item is not applicable to this contract.

Section C.7, 52.228-5 Insurance - Work on a Government Installation (Jan  1997) - We are a Instrumentality of the State of North Dakota and as a self insured entity we can not name additional insured.  We would request this be deleted as the services will be completed at a UND facility.  This item is not applicable to this contract and shall be removed from the solicitation.

Section C.12 VAAR 852.237-7 Indemnification and Medical Liability Insurance (JAN 2008) Part (c) we can not comply with this as we are self insured.  The clause has specific language addressing self-insured entities, "if the Contractor is an entity or a subdivision of a State that either provides for self-insurance or limits the liability or the amount of insurance purchased by State entities, then the insurance requirement of this contract shall be fulfilled by incorporating the provisions of the applicable State law" - by providing the applicable state law in your proposal the interested party is compliant with this clause. 


Section D. 1 Purpose - What needs to be done (QASP) or does anything needs to be done?  These assessments are performed by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative to verify the contractor is meeting the terms of the contract.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NB632030-11-01602 IS AMENDED AS FOLLOWS ADD:
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</p>
<p>1. The items listed do not include the following required hardware and I wanted to make sure you are intent on ordering without the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. USB keyboard, 17 in monitor, and USB mouse.</p>
<p>ANSWER: NIST does not need the keyboard, monitor and mouse. We will use the equipment in either remote desktop or LabView client mode.</p>
<p>b. NI PXIe-6363 32 16-bit Analog Channels X Series Data Acquisition Card is listed at quantity of 4. This module requires 2 cables and 2 connector blocks per module. The order lists Qty 4 of the cables and connectors so you are ordering only 1/2 of the required cable and connector blocks to utilize the 4 modules listed. Is this correct or do you really need 8?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We are planning to have two identical PXIe-systems for backup reasons. The quantities as ordered are correct and consistent with our plans for use of this equipment for data acquisition.</p>
<p><br />2. We will quote the items as two systems and deliver with the modules installed. Please let me know which modules you would like in each PXI chassis.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The PXIe-systems should be configured as follows:<br />PXIe chassis "A"<br />2 PXIe-6363 + 4 SCB-68 + 4 10m cables<br />2 PXIe-4353 + 2 TB-4353<br />1 PXIe-4331 + 1 TB-4330</p>
<p>PXIe chassis "B"<br />2 PXIe-6363<br />2 PXIe-4353 + 2 TB-4353</p>
<p><br />3. Your rfq asked for quotes for TB-4335 with the PXIe-4331, however, you will need the TB-4330 instead.</p>
<p>ANSWER:<br />The last item in our list should be one TB-4330 not TB-4353. We do need the TB-4353 (Qty. 4) as requested on an earlier line item. Please refer to the configuration information in the response to question 2 above.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>TITLE: Integrated Command &amp; Control</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 10-01-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br />Meeting the demands of assigned missions requires unprecedented amount of coordination and synchronization of military resources across all organizations and all echelons of command in all levels of war. It is command and control (C2) that provides the means by which a commander synchronizes and/or integrates force activities in order to achieve the commonly recognized objectives in one unity of effort. These activities require key decisions within the strategy, planning, scheduling and assessment phases of the command and control process. These decisions are made by humans and are supported by computer technology so it is in these areas that information technology contributes the most to ameliorating human capabilities and transforming how the Air Force commands and controls. <br />The goal of the Integrated C2 program is to lead the discovery, development and integration of revolutionary warfighting information technologies that enable continuous and distributed, planning, execution, and assessment of resources across the cyber, air and space domains to achieve commander's intent. Air Force Research Laboratory is seeking innovative white papers to address the following thrusts:<br /><br />&bull; Strategy Development. The functional translation of a commander's conceptual vision and guidance into potential solutions via an adaptive planning capability that supports the generation of a plan of action and seeks to answer the questions of what is to be done and how. By monitoring the plan and operating environment, adapt to evolving situations and represent the necessary actions which incorporate all means available across each of the warfighting domains of the Air Force (air, space and cyber). A key challenge is to understand the complex relationships and dependencies that exist across these domains. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: machine reasoning with uncertain, erroneous, and incomplete information; dynamic causal modeling and multi-criteria analysis summarization; computational efficient mixed initiative planning that balances cognitive and machine load; incorporation of analogical/experiential reasoning (fusion of distributed experiences, capturing knowledge &amp; experience of the past, determining relevancy of past situations); and asynchronous planning on plan fragments versus synchronous "lock and work" planning over multiple iterations.<br /><br />&bull; Synchronized/Integrated Planning. Produce a logistically feasible plan of action to solve the problem, fully integrating subordinate action plans with a description of the role of the other elements of national power in conjunction with military activities. Synchronized/integrated planning includes requests for actions and describes the role of military activities in achieving the desired effects. The integrated "battle" plan enables warfighters to coordinate and synchronize all available forces, kinetic and non-kinetic, to achieve the desired outcomes and exploit opportunities as they present themselves. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: a living plan with "on the fly" action plan/course of action adaptation/mutation that addresses changing conditions of the operational environment; identification, correlation, and advisement on mitigation of external events affecting the processes and mission; continuous adaptive planning; and comprehensive mission-driven situation awareness sharing.<br /><br />&bull; Continuous Assessment. Full spectrum analysis of the attainment of mission objectives at all levels of the campaign (tactical to strategic). At the plan's inception, conduct rigorous examinations of the alternatives and the desired and undesired consequences of each action leading to valuable insight into the actions, causal mechanisms, and effects that support the accomplishment of the objective. Leading indicators or clues can be explicitly identified with their timing which then can be used as a measure of progress towards accomplishing the desired objectives providing the means by which each player understands what is necessary to achieve the overall objectives and the ramifications of their individual actions. Such insights serve to highlight key challenges in sustaining a campaign's progress and are important for synchronizing the force. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: non-deterministic, non-linear causal analysis with reasoning through uncertainty and ambiguity; projective/forward looking analysis through modeling and simulation; use of belief networks within a decision-making environment and how beliefs influence a decision/assessment; dynamic assessment of a-priori and a-posteriori achievement of commander's intent; deliberate causal analysis that identifies key missing data that can be used as information requests; and optimized presentation of complex heterogeneous data.</p>
<p>Specific Focus Areas for 2011</p>
<p>Effects Assessment Methodology: Investigate quantitative analysis techniques that aid operational assessors' ability to link actions to effects to desired objectives. The specific goals of this effort are to 1) Explore and assess the mathematical techniques that can be applied to improve the performance of the weighted-additive model under conditions of missing data. Within the additive model the scores produced are directly influenced by the data consumed. Missing data will produce erroneous scores and provide misleading analyses and 2) Investigate techniques that demonstrate invariance under conditions of missing data and identify their utility in operational effects assessment. There may be instances where the derivation or estimation of missing data may not be feasible or appropriate. In addition, weighted-additive models have no ability to detect conditions where the data is erroneous.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 23 Jun 2010. Awards will not exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $350,000-$400,000.</p>
<p>N-Dimensional Effects-Based Assessment Tools: The objective is to provide operational-level assessors the capability to rapidly develop indicators that assess the Measures of Performance (MoPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MoEs) of a given plan. The indicators must span the spectrum from strategy-to-task planning, the warfighting domains (air, cyber, and space), and support the near-continuous assessment of effects. Specific goals include: (1) The use of case based reasoning with search algorithms and guidance templates to provide an automated means to assist warfighters in selecting suitable indicators, and (2) The use directed graphs to represent the alignment of operational objectives and effects to assess the achievement of the end-states to provide an intuitive user interface for indicator selection/management and visualizing the assessment. The metrics for this program will include the accuracy and completeness of the set of indicators recommended, improvement in the speed of the process (&Delta;t), and overall quality of the resulting operational assessment.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 23 June 2010. Awards will not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500,000 - $1,000,000.</p>
<p>COA Analysis Simulation (CASIM): The objective is to provide the ability to quickly develop simulations to analyze COAs and evaluate capabilities across multiple domains. The goals within this effort are to 1) Integrate disparate models and analysis tools within a federation and 2) Advance and employ an integrated composable modeling and simulation capability to create realistic cyber warfare operational scenarios for course of action (COA) exploration. <br />These goals are to be accomplished while taking into consideration the number of COAs analyzed/day, the breadth of effects considered, model integration and setup time, number of models integrated and entities run.<br />The models and simulations are to be focused on Cyber COA development and decision support tools.<br /><br />White papers for this topic will be due by: 21 Jun 10. Awards will range 12-24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $100,000 - $865,000.</p>

<p>Electronic submission to Jerry.Dussault@afrl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 1) The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates an understanding of the problem, an innovative and unique approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, its application and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly levels. 2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. 3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. 4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

Without this modification, Fort Drum will have no contract vehicle in place to permit timely placement of necessary construction projects. A determination not to compete this requirement is anticipated to be made pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1. <br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation for offers. No award will be placed solely on the basis of this notice, since synopsis of intent to place an order cannot be considered a request for proposals or offers. Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bonafide competition exists and whether a request for proposal is appropriate or feasible. Response to this notice must be made within seven calendar days after the posted date. <br><br>Fort Drum's new competitive follow-on contract is currently synopsized under Solicitation Number W911S2-11-R-8000 and is posted to www.fbo.gov. <br>

<p>Clarification for Source Sought:</p>
<p>Would the FLETC consider an airframe swap, in lieu of the existing requirement?</p>
<p>1. We would not be able to do an airframe "swap". The proposed FedEx aircraft would be transferred under FLETC's gifting authority with the expectation that we use it for law enforcement training. We cannot accept it for that purpose then turn around and transfer it to a third party for another aircraft. <br />2. However, I would be interested in what it would cost FLETC to obtain a passenger airframe that meets our configurations.</p>

Jim Starling began the meeting by leading everyone to the southeast end of the Maintenance Building by the Sign Shop.  He gave a brief history of rock fall problems dating back to 1940's, 50-60 years ago.  He stated that last October a rock came down through the Sign Shop.  It happened at 5:00 a.m. on a Saturday in late October.  He directed everyone's attention to the rock terrain to the south and east of the building; a specific ridge behind the building needs approximately 150 foot rock catchment.  Look at the slope and rock type.  He explained that we want a rock fence installed using a rockfall barrier system such as Geobrugg Barrier, using a computer modeling program similar to CRSP (see Scope of Work) to design the containment fence to the correct kijoule range, incorporating rock type, horizontal slope and vertical distance for fence installation.    
The fence shall be vinyl coated or powder coated a dark brown.  The installation needs to have the protection of natural resources in mind, using minimum impact techniques in accordance with National Park Service Resource Management Guidelines.  
Question - Can we use cranes and a helicopter?  Answer:  No helicopter or large equipment (without prior authorization). 
Jim said we will have to remove vegetation and boulders for the fence line placement with minimal impact.  Try to make it as invisible as possible.
Question - Is the vinyl coating to include all of the fencing materials, posts and hardware.  Answer:  Yes, posts and fencing, all that is possible.
Jim said he'd like to show everyone where the rock that fell into the building hit so they could get a feel for the situation we are under here.  He took the group into the Sign Shop and we observed the hole from the falling rock.  Question:   How long after you receive the offers do you anticipate to make award?   Answer:  The CO replied approximately within 2 to 3 weeks.
A question was asked:  Do we send the proposal design with the offer?  Will it be rated?   The CO said yes, all proposals will be rated according to the criteria in the evaluation section of the solicitation (Section M.).
A question was asked if there was only one software program that could be used.  No, it is up to the Contractor to propose, must be comparable to the Geobrugg.
Question raised could everyone attending could get a list of attendees?  Yes, we will provide it in the modification of the solicitation.
Jim said if you have any additional questions, Malinda Flatray, Contracting Officer, is the one to ask.
It was asked if permission was granted to walk up the slope and look the project area over?  Permission was granted.

Questions and Answers:
1.  How far up do you want the fence to go?  
The height, and horizontal and vertical slope will be determined using the Barrier system Geobrugg or similar with the computer modeling program similar to CRSP.  You should design the system using the program.
2.  Do you want a green fence?  
The fence shall be dark brown.
3.  Can we use powder coat vinyl?
Yes, if it is the same principle.  The bottom line is:  make it invisible as possible.  
4.  Will a right of way be issued?
No
5.  Could we use cranes and helicopters?
No
6.  Does the vinyl coating include all the fencing materials, posts, hardware, etc.?
Yes, fencing materials, posts, hardware, everything that can be painted or powder coated; color brown.
7.  How long after you receive the offers do you anticipate to make award?
Within approximately 2 to 3 weeks.
8.  Do we send the proposal design with the offer?
Yes, all proposals will be rated according to the criteria in the evaluation section of the solicitation (Section M.).
9.  A question was asked if there was only one software program that could be used.  
No, it is up to the Contractor to propose, must be comparable to the Geobrugg.
10.  Question was raised could everyone attending could get a list of attendees?  
Yes, we will provide it in the modification of the solicitation.

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>070611
<CONTACT>Dianne M Mount, Phone 732-323-2903, Email dianne.mount@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCAD) is requesting information pertaining to an electro-optical self test that would verify performance of the Third Generation Electro-Optical Console (EO3), (P/N: 2054AS400-2001) at the collimator aperture based on specification and/or TPS requirements. The Electro-Optic Third Generation (EO3) is a component of the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS). <br />The EO3 provides specialized capability for executing F-18 Advanced Tactical Forward Looking Infra-Red (ATFLIR) and SH60 FLIR Test Program Sets (TPSs). The cost of maintaining the EO3 is driven by asset removals. Periodic calibrations account for 38% of the removals. Could Not Duplicates (CNDs) account for 17% and Failures account for 45% of the removals. The Integrated Photonics Assembly (IPA) is the overwhelming majority of EO3 asset removals driven by a 12 month calibration cycle and high failure and CND rate. Results of preliminary analysis revealed the possibility of performing field calibrations, extending the calibration intervals by selective field calibrations, and moving to an electro-optical self test event driven calibration approach. The event driven calibration approach would replace the current calendar driven approach. The electro-optical self test may potentially verify performance of the EO3 console at the collimator aperture based on TPS requirements rather than the EO3 performance specification. <br />Respondents are asked to review the current EO3 requirements within the CASS B1 Prime Item Development Specification, ATFLIR TPS Test Strategy Report (TSR), and SH-60 FLIR TPS TSR to determine the actual EO3 requirements that should be verified to ensure unit-under-test (UUT) performance. Technical data, including the Performance Specification, directly related to the requirements of this RFI will be made available on CD-ROM disk to offerors intending to respond; however, some of the data is company proprietary and respondents must negotiate a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) directly with the company prior to receiving the disk. Respondents must first request the data from the Government, (which will be provided via traceable shipment of the CD-ROM disk upon confirmation that all documentation required for release has been provided). All requests for data must be in writing and must contain a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800) 352-3572 or at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp. The certified DD Form 2345 and your written request may be sent to the persons listed below via mail, email, or fax:<br />Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division<br />Code 25213, Bldg 562-2, Room 306<br />Highway 547<br />Lakehurst NJ 08733-5082<br /><br />Dianne Mount Allen Bresley<br />732-323-2903 Desk 732-323-4068 Desk<br />732-323-7440 Fax 732-323-2359 Fax<br />Dianne.Mount@navy.mil Allen.bresley@navy.mil
<p>The request for data and certified copy of the DD2345 should be submitted to Ms. Dianne Mount who will then provide the contact information to execute the non-disclosure agreement (also referred to as a proprietary information agreement (PIA)) discussed above. The company owning the data rights to proprietary data will notify the Navy points-of-contact that said NDA has been executed and at that time, the Navy will provide the data to the respondent.<br />Distribution to team members or sub-contractors of such data shall be the responsibility of the organization that was granted access and shall be limited to a "need to know" basis. All guidance contained herein with regard to handling, distribution, and destruction of the data shall be flowed down to all team members, partners, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors having access to the data. Those who take receipt of any portion or all of the data shall comply with all laws, export controls, provisions contained within the NDA and distribution statements associated with the data contained on the CD-ROM disk.<br />Requests for additional information not contained in the CD-ROM disk may be made to persons listed above. It is believed that all necessary information to respond to this RFI will be included on the CD_ROM disk; however, if you believe additional information not contained on the disk is necessary to respond, please notify one of the persons listed above and the Government shall determine whether release is necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; All respondents are required to destroy any and all original or copied CD-ROMs and any and all original or copied data files from any and all storage media and provide proof of such destruction via signed letter on corporate letterhead to the PCO at the above listed address.&nbsp; Unless permission is granted by the Government to retain data for a longer period, the letter notifying of destruction of the data must be received not later than 15 July 2011.<br />Analysis of the currently fielded EO3 self-test and Calibration programs would be required to understand the level of verification available now. The goal is to update the EO3 requirement; and design, develop, integrate, qualify, demonstrate and test an EO3 self test program that verifies the performance of the EO3 console at the collimator aperture based on TPS requirements. Specific questions that are expected to be addressed by the RFI are:<br />1. Please provide a detailed technical description of your suggested solution along with any possible alternatives.<br />2. What are the estimated NRE costs* to develop the suggested solution?<br />3. What are the estimated production costs* of the suggested solution?<br />4. What are the estimated sustainment /calibration costs* for the suggested solution?<br />5. What is the calibration interval for the equipment required by the suggested solution?<br />6. What is the predicted reliability for the equipment required by the suggested solution?<br />7. Will the suggested solution require special operator training?<br />8. How will the suggested solution be demonstrated?<br />9. What changes would the vendor recommend to the CASS B1 Specification based on actual TPS usage of the EO3?<br />10. If the B1 Specification were not changed, what Test Accuracy Ratio (TAR) would be achieved with the suggested solution?<br />11. If the B1 Specification were changed to reflect actual TPS usage, what TAR would be achieved with the suggested solution?<br />12. What EO3 functions/components need to be tested (include the attributable performance indices)?<br />13. The goal of any suggested solution is to verify the EO3 is within calibration allowances.<br />a. Will the suggested solution verify calibration?<br />b. Will the fleet operator be able to perform limited adjustments (calibrate) on any of the items in the EO3?<br />c. What limited adjustments will the fleet operator be able to make with the proposed solution?<br />14. Please detail the vendor's experience, including any team members, with EO test equipment and associated support of support equipment?<br />The EO3 self test program will be developed where possible re-using available hardware, fixtures and software currently in inventory. These items include:<br />1. Optic Stabilizer Test Fixture, P/N: 74D060311-2101/-2103<br />2. Pod Fwd Section Upper Fixture, P/N: 74D060311-2201<br />3.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Each firm must address in its SF330 submittal package the following selection criteria for all proposed services under this solicitation. Evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance, except as noted: Evaluation Criteria (1), (2), and (3) are of equal importance to each other.
 Criteria (4) and (5) are of lesser importance than Criteria (1), (2), & (3) but are equal to each other in importance; and Criteria (6), (7), (8), and (9) are of equal importance to each other, and of lesser importance than Criteria (4) and (5). The Navy is announcing a total of four (4) regional CONUS requirements for Waterfront Inspection Architect-Engineer services; ultimate result will be up to four (4) separate single award IDIQ contracts to cover all CONUS Navy requirements. The slate and selection processes for the 4 CONUS regions will be conducted concurrently. Impacts to capacity due to selections for multiple regions will be considered under both Criteria (4)- Capacity and Criteria (5)- Location and will play a role in determining the number of awards to cover the 4 CONUS regions.
 Each CONUS award, whether this synopsis results in 1, 2, 3, or 4 awards, will be 100% set aside for small business.

SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criteria responses. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. 

All projects provided in the SF 330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this contract.
 Projects not performed by the office/branch/individual team member will be excluded from evaluation consideration.

 EMR and DART Rates shall not be submitted for subcontractors.) 
(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): 
For the three previous complete calendar years, 2008, 2009, 2010, submit your EMR (which compares your companys annual losses in insurance claims against its policy premiums over a three year period). If you have no EMR, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the EMR and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: 
For the three previous complete calendar years, 2008, 2009, 2010, submit your OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate, as defined by the U.S.
 Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. If you cannot submit an OSHA DART Rate, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the OSHA DART Rate data and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(3) Technical Approach for Safety: 
Describe the plan that the firm will implement to evaluate safety performance of potential subcontractors as a part of the selection process for all levels of subcontractors. Also, describe any innovative methods that the firm will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels.
 The Safety Narrative shall be limited to two pages. 
(b) BASIS OF EVALUATION: The Government is seeking to determine that the firm has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the firm plans to properly manage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The Government will evaluate the firms overall safety record, the firms plan to select and monitor subcontractors, and any innovative safety methods that the firm plans to implement for this procurement. The Governments sources of information for evaluating safety may include, but are not limited to, OSHA, NAVFACs Facility Accident and Incident Reporting (FAIR) database, and other related databases.
 While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete safety information regarding these submittal requirements rests with the firm. The evaluation will collectively consider the following: 
- Experience Modification Rate (EMR) 
- OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate 
- Firm Technical Approach to Safety 
- Other sources of information available to the Government 
(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): 
The Government will evaluate the EMR to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices, taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rating.
 Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: 
The Government will evaluate the OSHA DART Rate to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices, taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rates. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. 
(3) Technical Approach to Safety:

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
As required by FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Procure emergency lease and maintenance services for 25 flexible endoscopes and associated digital processors.
		    
3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  The Edward Hines VA Hospital has requested a one year lease and maintenance services for 25 flexible endoscopes and associated digital processors for the facility.  The much of current equipment is in a constant state of repair and cannot be used for patient procedures, leaving a minimal amount of equipment to keep up with patient demand.  Patients are made to wait while the endoscope utilized for their procedure is disinfected. The Edward Hines VA Hospital is in a critical shortage of operable endoscopes in order to meet patient diagnosis and treatment needs.  The approximate cost is $210,291.00 for the one year lease period.
  
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  The VA's need for the supply is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:   The facility requires equipment which will allow them to provide safe, advanced and appropriate patient care to the veteran population.  Based upon information provided by the facility, the emergency lease of flexible scopes is required.  The endoscopes are highly advanced allowing the Edward Hines VA Hospital to detect lesions and treat them.  The lack of endoscopes create unacceptable delays and cancelations from providing proper care which is creating the possibility of life threatening situations for critically ill patients in the diagnoses of disease progression.  

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The National Acquisition Center approved the Federal Supply schedule (FSS) request for waiver in order to procure the requested lease as an open market request to Fujinon which will meet the facilities minimum needs.  This is an urgent request so no other offers were solicited.        

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was confirmed with COTR on past purchases for the same or similar type equipment and is comparable.  

8.	Market survey conducted:  Currently, there is only one FSS vendor for the requested type of lease and service but will not be able to meet the minimum needs of the facility.  Based upon the urgent and compelling need, and the approved FSS Waiver, no further market research was conducted.   

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The National Acquisition Center is currently working on blanket purchase agreements with various vendors for flexible endoscope leases.

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Based upon information received from the station, we concur that it is in the best interest of the government to proceed with the emergency procurement with this firm.

<DESC>This notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and is not a request for proposals. IAW with FAR 6.305 notice is hereby given of Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition.
<p>1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity.</p>
<p>HHS/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>This justification is for the authority to issue Cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for a one year performance period to National Government Services (NGS) to provide payment services to first responders in accordance with the WTC Act. Due to the urgent and compelling need to begin making payments to providers for medical treatment of first responders by July 2011, it is critical to limit this solicitation to a contractor with the capability of issuing payments outside the Medicare claim processing system using established, tested and approved software and technology, that complies with CMS security and architecture requirements. In addition the contractor must have an established EFT transfer connectivity with a Medicare bank (either US Bank or JP Morgan) via Gentran at the CMS data center. The contractor must also be FISMA and 508 compliant and meet all security, compliance and financial management and liability requirements that are identified in the MAC contracts at time of award. After the one year period, the contract shall be re-competed under competitive procedures.</p>
<p>There is no other viable alternative to awarding a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that could be found which would meet the collective requirements of time, end result effectiveness, cost/price, lowest risk to the Government, and highest quality result.</p>
<p>Under the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act of 2010 (Pub.L.111-347), hereinafter referred to the World Trade Center (WTC) Act, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been authorized to establish Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) to provide health care for first responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) September 2001 incident. Section 3331 of the Act requires the CDC to pay claims associated with medical treatment for first responders. The WTC Health Program also requires that an OPDIV other than NIOSH (CDC) process the payments for these services. CMS is able to provide payment services in compliance with the legislation and has initiated preliminary conversations with CDC to effectuate that arrangement.</p>
<p>NGS is currently contracting with CMS to provide similar services as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Payment File Development Contractor. NGS is currently under contract to provide similar payment services to providers under the HITECH program using an established payment system that meets all the stated CMS requirements and can easily be leveraged to make WTC payments in accordance with the July 2011 timetable.</p>
<p>The contract action associated with this justification will be for a 12-month performance period from the date of award.</p>
<p>The attacks at the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001 exposed rescue and recovery workers to unprecedented risks for job-related injury, illness, and death. Starting in FY 2002, funds were appropriated by Congress to the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide medical screening and monitoring for these workers, and in FY 2006, additional funds for medical treatment of this population. In response to Congressional appropriations language, NIOSH implemented health programs for responders and non-responders (workers, residents, and others in the vicinity of the WTC site). The following link can be used to access information related to these programs:</p>
<p>http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/wtc/</p>
<p>On December 22, 2010 legislation was passed by the Congress to provide health monitoring and treatment to 9/11 workers and survivors. On January 2, 2011, the President signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act into law and it is hereafter referred to as the "WTC Act". The WTC Act encompasses a myriad of responsibilities associated with the administration and performance needed to screen and monitor eligible individuals, provide treatment and reimburse clinics for the eligible healthcare that is provided. The WTC Act can be found at:</p>
<p>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr847enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr847enr.pdf</p>
<p>Importantly, the WTC Act specifies that CDC/NIOSH cannot be authorized or associated with the claims compensation-and-disbursement function of the WTC Program. In that regard, there is a deliberate and clear separation of authority between program administration and fiscal activities related to claims payments. Therefore another Government authority, or a designated trusted agent, must oversee the claims payment processing. However, there are ongoing responsibilities related to "Program Management and Administration" that must include informational interfaces to the Payor function to provide oversight and accountability.</p>
<p>3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br />a. Project title. WTC Payment Contractor<br />b. Project description. <br />The CMS Financial Services Group (FSG), Division of Financial Strategies and Evaluation (DFSE), has agreed to coordinate the payment processing on behalf of CDC/NIOSH for the WTC program through a Payment Contractor (NGS). To facilitate this payment function, CMS has defined our services as follows:</p>
<p>1. CMS shall disburse payments through a WTC Payment Contractor that shall leverage the payment system developed for the HITECH EHR Incentive Payment Program and process these payments through the CMS Demonstration Payment System (DPS), Financial Accounting Control System (FACS) and a Medicare bank account. CMS shall establish one or more CAN numbers for the WTC payment appropriation to draw funding against for each payment cycle.</p>
<p>2. The WTC Payment Contractor shall receive an electronic payment information file from CDC/NIOSH or designated contractor with the eligible payment recipients and amounts for each payment cycle. The payment information file shall be in a format to be defined and shall include the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), full legal/business name, the necessary banking (account/routing numbers and type of account -savings/checking) to disburse EFTs and the payment address to mail paper check payments as required. Payment information files received by the WTC Payment Contractor that do not contain the necessary information to make accurate payments or are otherwise incomplete shall be rejected and returned to the CDC/NIOSH or designated contractor.</p>
<p>3. From the electronic payment information file, the WTC Payment Contractor shall: prepare an EFT file and/or positive pay checks issuance file to send to the Medicare bank; conduct Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) withholding through the Treasury on the recipient payments; and prepare a summary file for payment authorization by a CMS official.</p>
<p>4. The authorized payment shall be processed by CMS through DPS and FACs and sent to the Treasury; the Treasury shall deposit the funds into the Medicare bank account and the bank shall deposit the EFTs into the recipient bank accounts.</p>
<p>5. The WTC Payment Contractor shall reconcile the Medicare bank account and forward financial reports to CMS; CMS shall forward the detailed payment cycle reports to both CMS and CDC/NIOSH.</p>
<p>6. The WTC Payment Contractor shall process and mail all 1099 tax forms as required for these payments.</p>
<p>The following services must be provided by CDC/NIOSH and shall not be provided by CMS or its WTC Payment Contractor:</p>
<p>1. Adjudicate the claim.</p>
<p>2. Identify eligible recipients</p>
<p>3. Determine payment appropriateness or payment amounts to eligible recipients.</p>
<p>4. Gather banking information on eligible recipients.</p>
<p>5. Construct the payment information file.</p>
<p>6. Resolve exceptions and error correction.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41USC &sect;253(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency - delay in the award from using full and open competition would result in the failure of the Government to make payments to providers of healthcare for WTC first responders by the required start date of July 1, 2011.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br />a. Name and address of the proposed contractor(s). <br />National Government Services (NGS) <br />9901 Linn Station Road <br />Louisville, Kentucky 40223</p>
<p>b. Nature of the acquisition and proposed unique qualifications of the contractor(s). <br />Due to the urgent and compelling need to begin making payments to providers for medical treatment of first responders by July 1, 2011, it is critical to obtain the services of a contractor with the existing capability of issuing payments outside the Medicare claim processing system using established, tested and approved software and technology, that complies with CMS security and architecture requirements. In addition the contractor must have established EFT transfer connectivity with a Medicare bank (either US Bank or JP Morgan) via Gentran at the CMS data center. The contractor must also be FISMA and 508 compliant and meet all security, compliance and financial management and liability requirements that are identified in the MAC contracts at time of award. Because NGS is currently under contract to provide similar payment services to providers under the HITECH program using an established payment system that meets all the stated CMS requirements and can easily be leveraged to make WTC payments in accordance with the July 2011 timetable, CMS intends to issue a contract to NGS for a period of one year. After the one year period, the contract shall be re-competed using competitive procedures. There are no other contractors that have an established payment system (outside of the Medicare claims payment processing system) that conforms to all CMS security and programmatic requirements that have been thoroughly vetted by CMS technical review board and tested by an independent testing contractor, capable of making payments to WTC recipients by July 1, 2011. In addition, the request for CMS to participate in this project with CDC/NIOSH was not agreed upon until only recently. The inter-agency agreement between these two partners that states the terms that execute these functions has only recently, first part of March 2011, been drafted and agreed to. The inter-agency agreement is currently completed and awaiting signature. The respective roles and requirements for CMS and the CDC are clearly outlined and there is no expectation that these will be subject to change.</p>
<p>6. Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. Indicate whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. <br />NGS is currently under contract to provide similar payment services to providers under the HITECH program using an established payment system that meets all the stated CMS requirements and can easily be leveraged to make WTC payments in accordance with the July 2011 timetable. NGS is the only contactor that meets all CMS requirements for the WTC Payment Contractor with an established payment system that can process separately appropriated or designated funds outside the Medicare claims payments system; that is connected to CMS, the Treasury, and the Medicare Bank; that has been thoroughly tested by an independent testing contractor, and approved by the CMS Systems Architecture Technical Review Board; that meets all CMS IT security requirements; and that can be adapted and implemented for the purpose of making WTC payments by July 1, 2011.</p>
<p>A FedBizOpps notice was not published as the exception at 5.202(a)(2) applies. The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 6.302-2 "unusual and compelling urgency" and the Government would be seriously disadvantaged if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203 as the agency would be unable to meet the July 2011 deadline to commence making payments.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost/price to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Prior to the award of the contract, a determination was made by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer obtained cost and pricing information and also required that such cost and pricing information be certified in accordance with FAR 15.406-2. The Contracting Officer performed cost analysis to determine that the price to the Government for the services covered by this JOFOC is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.4. A separate audit of the proposal is not anticipated due to CMS having current audit information in house.</p>
<p>8. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and only one company provided the expertise to perform the requirements within the required timelines for the following reason:</p>
<p>The only contractors that meet the financial management and liability qualifications associated with the WTC requirements are the MACs. With the exception of NGS, none of the current MACs are capable of making payment without a Letter of Credit funding authorization as used to make Medicare payments to Medicare providers; however, because Letters of Credit will not be used in the WTC program and the funding is not Medicare funding and the providers are not Medicare providers, the contractor must have a separate payment system, manage a separate account with the Medicare bank (US Bank) for WTC funds deposit, and make payments to non-Medicare providers. The payment system must meet all CMS business and security requirements and must be able to generate payments by 7/1/11. The contractor must also have the established capability for file exchange with the Treasury for the purpose of withholding for Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) tax and non tax debt from the WTC payments. NGS meets these requirements.</p>
<p>NGS is under contract with CMS to make HITECH payments; similar to WTC payments, these are separately appropriated funds that must be tracked and managed separately; they cannot be comingled with other funding sources. Currently, because of the Letter of Credit funding process used by the MACs, only NGS can receive and manage separately appropriated funds without comingling them with Medicare funds. Furthermore, NGS was selected for the HITECH contract through full and open competition; the award was made after first reviewing, evaluating small businesses. None of these small businesses met the financial and technical requirements for the HITECH project. Because WTC is very similar to HITECH and due to the fact it has taken eight months to establish the payment system for HITECH that has been thoroughly tested and complies with all CMS requirements, we believe there is no other contractor currently capable of making WTC payments in compliance with all CMS requirements to begin operation by 7/1/11.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, payments must be able to be disbursed beginning July 2011. In order to meet this timeframe, CMS seeks to issue a contract to a contractor that can leverage a similar existing system that has already been proven workable and approved by CMS. It would take the agency at least 60 - 90 days to complete a competition using a streamlined approach, such as GSA. Conducting a competition would not leave enough time for the contractor to get up and running and be able to start making payments as of July 2011. Further, based on our experience with the HITECH program, CMS believes that it would take a contractor, without an existing separate payment system, roughly eight months to be capable of making payments according to the WTC requirements.</p>
<p>CMS's needs for these services are of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be severely disadvantaged, unless it is permitted to limit the number of sources for this work. If CMS is unable to issue this sole source contract, it will be unable to meet the requirements to begin making payments by July 1, 2011. Should these payments be delayed, there is a strong likelihood of adversely impacting the availability of future healthcare to those individuals covered under the WTC Act.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>11. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or services. <br />The Project Office will work with the cognizant Contracting Officer to develop a procurement strategy using competitive procedures for the continuation of this effort after the first year. This JOFOC covers a period of one year only.</p>

Justification and Approval For SDVOSB Sole-Source

Upon the basis of the following justification, a sole-source procurement to a SDVOSB for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved based on the contracting officer's market research.

1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  

The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Energy Business Center, 4141 Rockside Rd., Seven Hills, Ohio, 44131.

2.	Nature/Description of Action

This activity proposes to issue an RFP to Lee & Ryan Environmental Consulting, Inc., an SDVOSB, for three (3) separate E85 Fueling Stations, one to be installed at the Clement J Zablocki VA Medical Center, located at 5000 West National Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53295, one at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center, located at 325 East H Street, Iron Mountain, MI 49801, and one at the Edward Hines VA Medical Center, located at 5000 S. Fifth Avenue, Hines, IL 60141.  There are also options for the fuel stations to be powered with Solar PV and include storage batteries.  The government estimate for the base and all options is $833,911.20.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services

The E85 fueling stations will be 12,000 gallons at Milwaukee, 5,000 gallons at Iron Mountain and 10,000 gallons at Hines, and the contractor shall be responsible for all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, design, site preparation, services, training, lighting, camera(s), landscaping, communications, schematic layout, drawings, instruction, Operation and Maintenance manuals, As Built drawings, permits and zoning processes, design, construction, installation and commissioning.  The system shall include the following:

A.	The fueling station tank shall be double-walled and ballistic proof.  The skid shall be anchored to the new concrete foundation.  The concrete foundation design shall be prepared and stamped by a structural engineer licensed in the states of Wisconsin and Illinois, respectively.  The fuel will be delivered to the storage tank from the fuel transport truck by means of a dedicated remote fuel transfer pump that is integrated to the fueling station.  The fueling station pump will supply fuel to the fuel dispenser located in, or adjacent to, the containment area.  A Programmable Logic Control (PLC) panel will control the fuel system.

B.	The fuel tank, pumps, dispensers and related equipment shall be skid mounted and provided as a turn-key system.  The contractor shall provide an integrally constructed and fabricated, tested and certified system prior to delivery to the VA site.  The tank shall contain a product decal specific to the site.  Where required, containment structures shall be constructed of steel-reinforced concrete.

C.	Provide on-demand, monitoring and reporting of actual fuel consumption, vehicle ID, odometer reading, date of fueling and gallons dispensed.  Date of fuel transport shall be included.

D.	Contractor shall provide a card reader/fuel management system capable of authorizing and recording both fuel and fuel transactions using the Wright Express (WEX) and General Services Administration (GSA) Smart fuel cards processing system. The controller shall be compatible with the GSA controller to assist in the reimbursement for the E85 fuel.  The system shall be connected to one or more remote billing services by telephone modem for a high speed line, for the purpose of remotely authorizing, recording, and billing transactions by fuel networks (such as Voyager).  The Contractor shall be responsible for setting up the remote billing accounts coordinated by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR). (See Appendix C)

E.	The E85 Fueling Station shall include clearance warning signs, where appropriate.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition

Authority is authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C 8127 under PL 109-461, as well as FAR 6.302-5, Authorized by Statute.

5.	Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications

Lee & Ryan Environmental Consulting, Inc. is registered and verified in the VIP Database (www.vetbiz.gov), as well as CCR, and has the applicable NAICS code (237120).

6.	Publicized Requirements

This J&A shall be posted within 14 days after an award is made.

7.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost

The determination of a fair and reasonable cost will be accomplished through the comparison of proposed price with the government estimate.  

8.	Market Survey

Lee & Ryan Environmental Consulting, Inc. was recommended to the NEBC by the VISN 12 site energy engineers.  A phone interview and email correspondence with a representative of the company, Jessica Simmons-Tower, was completed by the contract specialist in order to ensure their capability to complete this project. 

9.	Other
