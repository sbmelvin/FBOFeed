<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Arrow Tech, 1233 Shelburne Rd. Suite D-8, South Burlington, VT, 05403. It is anticipated that the total contract period of performance will not exceed (6) six months from time of award. <br />The Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Office (MCAPO) requires expertise in support of PGU-28 A/B 20mm High Explosive Incendiary Ammunition ballistic spark range testing at the Eglin AFB, Florida Aeroballistics Research Facility (ARF). The scope of the test program is to collect and reduce data derived from firings of PGU-28 A/B spin stabilized projectiles in the ARF covering the Mach regime from 0.7 to 3.0. The objective of the data reduction is to obtain aerodynamic characteristics (force and moment coefficients), including the dynamic stability derivatives.<br />The contractor shall convert measurements from the digitized images supplied by the ARF into the Arrow Tech-proprietary Aeroballistics Research Facility Data Analysis System (ARFDAS) compatible files. ARFDAS is the only known software specifically developed and tested for the Eglin ARF to produce six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) characterizations of spin stabilized projectiles. Additionally, the contractor shall be prepared to begin this task NLT 19 July 2010 in conjunction with on-going ammunition Developmental Test and Force Development Evaluation to facilitate required October 2010 completion of all testing and timely fielding recommendation to ease current combat-use only restriction of this ammunition. <br />The contractor will submit a final written report (digitized photos, mass properties and test conditions) to include axisymmetric static force and moment coefficients: CX, CN, and Cm and dynamic force and moment coefficients with particular attention given to the pitch-damping coefficient and the Magnus moment. <br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE. The proposed contract action is for work for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR .302-1, "Only One Responsible Source". The 685 believes that award to any other source would not provide the capability of 6-DOF aerodynamic characteristics (force and moment coefficients) including the dynamic stability derivatives resultant from testing in Eglin AFB, ARF. Therefore, any Offerors responding to the notice must provide evidence of technical and operational experience with spin stabilized projectile aeroballistics data reduction, proprietary rights to ARFDAS software, and ability to meet the 19 July 2010 support date. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Arrow Tech is the only known source of the technical expertise required to support this requirement. Anticipated award date us on or around 30 June 2010.<br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), DART, EPHB HLPT Branch, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to TiER1 Performance Solutions to redesign, revise and develop educational and informational web-tools for the NIOSH power tools database website, Noise Control Compedium document, "buy quiet" roadmap and Safe-In-Sound award.
<p>Project Background:<br />NIOSH advocates the primacy of engineering controls for controlling workplace exposure to noise. This policy states that, whenever feasible, engineering controls should be used to prevent workplace exposure to hazardous chemicals and physical agents such as noise. Other less protective forms of control such as personal protective equipment (PPE), work practices, and administrative controls should be used only when engineering controls are not feasible. It is given that noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational illnesses in the United States. Occupational hearing loss is a permanent illness, with no recovery currently possible. Hearing loss severely impairs the quality of life, and in its most severe degree, presents a handicap that prevents the worker from being able to communicate effectively at work and at home. The effects of NIHL may be immediate hearing loss that is permanent and/or may be accompanied by tinnitus. Tinnitus is a ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ears or head. The effects of hearing impairment also have serious consequences to the individual's ability to communicate in social and family settings, recognize auditory warnings, and may lead to added job stress and decreased job performance.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br />Assistance in revising existing power tools database website for ease of use and understanding, converting the Noise Control Compendium document into a web based training and information tool, customizing existing web based "buy quiet roadmap" for application to large construction firm, and assisting in the developmet of a Safe-In-Sound award application website. These services require extensive experience in the development of web based educational tools and utilization of advanced marketing skills. The sole source contract brings together creative marketing, web based educational design and development techniques, implementation, and post implementation effectiveness analysis expertise. <br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12321. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with TiER1 Performance Solutions, 6 East 5th Street #400, Covington, KY 41011 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>This Market Survey is issued to determine the availability of companies for the hardware, installation, and certification of an UNS 1FW Flight Management System at the Atlantic City International Airport, NJ. The FAA Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) program office is pursuing a project that examines the use of WAAS on helicopters in New York City.  The goal of the project is to show the advantages of using WAAS on helicopters in this environment and to develop new procedures so helicopters can safely and efficiently navigate in the crowded New York City airspace.
To support this project, flight testing will be necessary.  The FAA William J Hughes Technical Center owns and operates a Sikorsky S-76A helicopter.  This aircraft is used by the FAA for engineering flight testing and flight demonstrations.  The 'S-76' currently does not have a WAAS shipboard capability that is required to conduct these flight tests and demonstrations.  The upgrade to incorporate WAAS in the 'S-76' is to upgrade the flight management system (FMS).  The project will require the certification of the new equipment.
Interested parties must meet the following requirements: 
1- Must be able supply the FAA with a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for installation and certification of the Universal UNS-1FW with LP/LPV monitor receiver system on the Sikorsky S-76A helicopter.
2- Must be able to provide the STC for installation and certification of the WAAS antenna mount on the tail rotor drive shaft cover on the S-76A helicopter
3- All work must be completed at the FAA Technical Center, Atlantic City Airport, NJ.

Submissions of capability summaries are due by 2pm Friday June 25, 2010. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement. Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration capabilities. Responses will not be returned. This is a market survey so NO solicitation exists. 
All questions are to be submitted, via email, to harry.lutz@faa.gov not later than 2pm Eastern Standard Time June 23, 2010. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.
All responses to this announcement must be submitted, via email, to harry.lutz@faa.gov not later than 2pm Eastern Standard Time, Friday June 25, 2010.

<p><br />Contract Type: The government anticipates an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vehicle with Fixed Price and Labor Hour task orders. Base year plus 4 option years. There is the possibility for Multiple Award Contracts.</p>
<p>Preference: HUBZone</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Category 1:<br />The first principal objective of this contract will be to develop a capability to support CFSAN research by rapidly assessing the quantities of specified chemicals in foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics through surveys of these commodities. The purpose of these surveys will be to develop a better understanding of the quantities of chemicals and their distribution. The types of samples to be collected for these studies will include food products from across the United States, including but not limited to fresh fruits and produce, packaged and processed foods of all types, dietary supplements and cosmetics. The analytical targets of these studies will include chemical contaminants in foods (e.g. pesticides, industrial chemicals), direct food additives, indirect food additives (those produced by processing or transfer from packaging), deliberate adulterants, nutrients, naturally occurring chemical components (such as metals), as well as the chemical constituents of dietary supplements, botanical extracts and cosmetics. The analytical methodology for any specified study will be established and provided by CFSAN, and will include methods based upon state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including many based on instrumental analysis with various types of separation techniques and spectrometers.</p>
<p>Category 2:</p>
<p>The second principal objective will be to provide method validation services in cases where rapid third party validation of FDA-developed analytical methods are needed. Methods developed at FDA laboratories will need to be validated by multiple laboratories in order to provide the foundation for use of methods throughout the FDA. Validation protocols shall be provided by CFSAN and the third party laboratory would perform the validation protocol and generate a method validation report and associated data according to CFSAN's requirements.</p>
<p>Category 3:</p>
<p>The third principal objective is the synthesis of standards and other chemicals needed for the successful development of analytical methods. These include compounds that are not available as standard products. The FDA will specify chemical standards, chemical derivatives, and isomers of compounds of interest to be synthesized. The FDA will also specify the production of stable-isotope labeled chemical standards, as well as the production of stable-isotope labeled protein standards.</p>
<p><br />Additional Information:</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>The FINAL RFP solicitation may be an upload to this pre-solicitation notice. NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments in writing to Ariana Nijaradze via email to ariana.nijaradze@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for construction of an ADA compliant dock and dock related work as described below. The solicitation will be issued electronically, through Fedbizopps (www.fbo.gov) and on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and/or Adobe PDF. Specifications and drawings will be available in Word and/or Adobe PDF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification for this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation. Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent.
DESCRIPTION:  The work of this contract consists of stabilizing the bulkhead that protects the edge of the existing boat launch and constructing a new accessible fixed walkway that will provide mooring for passenger ferries on Lake Chelan. Specific elements include, but are not limited to, the following:
Removal of approximately 13 existing wooden piles.
Stabilization of approximately 50 lineal feet of existing boat launch bulkhead. Stabilization will include driving steel piles, attaching steel beams faced with sheet pile, securing the steel framework with deadman anchors into the existing boat launch, and backfilling with coarse aggregate.
Installation of approximately 13 steel mooring piles and eight structural support piles.
Construction of new accessible fixed walkway mooring structure for passenger ferries. Construction will include pouring approximately 200 lineal feet of cast-in-place concrete curb, assembling the steel superstructure for a 234' x 17' walkway, attaching fiberglass decking, and installing removable steel handrails and fixed steel bull rails.
PROJECT LOCATION: Stehekin is located at the head of Lake Chelan, 55 miles from the town of Chelan, WA, within Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at  http://www.nps.gov/archive/noca/focus/focus.htm or http://www.stehekinvalley.com/. The only access is by public passenger-only ferry, barge, private vessel, or float plane from Chelan. Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge company before submitting an offer. Some tools and materials may be sent on the passenger ferry.
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: Stehekin is one of the most remote sites in the contiguous 48 states. During off season months, the ferries operate only three days a week, and there are no stores open in the community. The nearest community with significant services, Chelan, is approximately 50 miles down lake on Lake Chelan. Winter weather is severe, with several feet of snow on the ground at times. Freezing temperatures and precipitation (snow and freezing rain) are to be expected in the winter period. The lake water level fluctuates seasonally by as much as 17.5 feet, between maximum elevations of 1,100 feet to a minimum of 1,079 feet. While the lake generally rises and falls slowly, it has been known to rise as much as four feet in two days during severe rainstorms. The average drawdown over the past 20 years has been at 1,084 feet. The annual lake drawdown typically starts in October and continues to April at which time the lake is at its lowest level. From May through June, refill occurs. By the end of June to early July, the lake is at its maximum elevation (more information on lake operation can be found at the Chelan County PUD web site, www.chelanpud.org/). This fluctuation subjects the bulkhead to extreme conditions.  It is at near submerged condition in the summer/fall and fully exposed in the winter/spring. Demolition, installation of the precast items and wall backfill are restricted to the period when the water is below elevation 1086. It will not be possible to shelter the site by a breakwater or other facilities during construction. A complete understanding of all restrictions and permitting requirements is required. All construction materials and debris, including all trash from any Contractor generated source including temporary housing or camp facilities, which are not part of the final work shall be completely removed from the park for reuse, recycling, or disposal. No disposal of any items shall be allowed within the park.
The full scope of the anticipated contract will be included in the solicitation. The estimated period of performance is 210 days. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The estimated magnitude of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The project is subject to the Davis Bacon Act and applicable Department of Labor wage rates. A Bid Guarantee, Payment Bond, and Performance Bond will be required, full information will be provided in the solicitation. An organized site visit and pre-bid meeting will be scheduled for this project. The estimated date for the organized site visit is July 13, 2010. The solicitation will be unrestricted and proposals will be accepted from all responsible sources pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, FAR Subpart 19.10. The Government intends to award a single contract. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the government, technical factors and cost or price considered. A "best value" award will be made to select the contractor, full information will be provided in the solicitation.
REGISTRATIONS: In order to receive contract award, a vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register a firm in the CCR and ORCA system, visit http://www.bpn.gov 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. 
The anticipated date for issuance of the solicitation is June 30, 2010 with proposals due approximately 30 days thereafter. Dates stated are estimates and are subject to change. This announcement does not constitute the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation. 
All questions must be submitted in writing to the address below or via email to barry_fetzer@nps.gov  Point of Contact, Barry Fetzer, Supervisory Contract Specialist, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284. Phone requests for information will not be honored.

BLDG 2 & CHALLENGE COURSE REMODEL PROJECT
FBO PRESOLICITATION DESCRIPTION

The VA Medical Center Sheridan Wyoming, located at 1898 Fort Road, Sheridan, Wyoming is soliciting bids for the Boiler Plant Design Project Project #666-11-101.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Integrated Service Network 19 (VISN 19), is soliciting bids under Solicitation Number VA-259-10-RP-0161 for the following:

Professional Architectural/Engineering Services are required at the VAMC at Sheridan, Wyoming located at 1898 Fort Road, Sheridan, WY 82801 to provide an investigative report, contract documents, and specifications, and construction period services for necessary for the design of the new boiler plant.  The prime consultant may be either and architectural firm or a boiler plant design engineering firm, or an architectural firm with a boiler plant design engineering firm as a sub consultant. The project includes the complete replacement of existing boilers and all support systems within the boiler plant, including steam piping and accessories, feedwater and condensate transfer pumps, deaerator/feedwater, heater, condensate storage tank, condensate receiver, fuel handling systems, stack and emissions control systems, boiler controls, supporting electrical systems, etc.  This project will also separate 13 of the smaller residential quarters, buildings from the main steam distribution system design will include individual heating systems for each. New boilers will be factory-built packaged steel boilers, fire box, fire tube, water tube or hybrid design, high efficiency in order to meet VA energy mandates per EPACT 2005, EISA 2007 and Executive Orders.  Systems will include stack economizers and other energy saving systems that maximize efficiency.  AE shall select major boiler plant equipment and apply energy-saving systems based on fundamental economic analysis of the application of said equipment and systems.  The existing site steam distribution and condensate return systems may require augmentation to increase capacity to meet the steam load of proposed buildings.  A/E shall analyze the distribution system considering planned building projects to determine requirements for augmentations.  If modifications to the existing boiler plant building are needed for new boilers, such modifications shall be designed to meet the historic building requirements of the Veteran Administration.  Additional space and connection points into emission stream for future carbon capture technology shall also be incorporated in the design and indicated on plans.  The overall intent of this project is to have a new plant with a 30 year life that will not require substantial renovation during that 30 year period with overall plant efficiency above 80%, has low emissions and the potential for carbon capture.  The VA will also consider a design that has the flexibility to mix biomass with coal.  The design load must include additional future loads. Products used in this design must meet the Buy American Act. 

Design services must be completed by February 15, 2011. 

Design scope of work will include:
A.	Provide professional services including, but not limited to, conceptual design, construction documents and specifications, verification of as-built drawings, accurate cost estimates and construction period services. The designer will also prepare documents and submit applications for all permits required by EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 52.21 (Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality) on behalf of the VA.  They shall also prepare documents and file for all air pollution control permits required for operation of this Boiler Plant. 

B.	Site investigation of the existing plant must be completed to verify dimensions and current conditions of building and equipment required to support the generation of steam within the plant.  Any existing equipment that is to remain in place and operation must be identified in the report.  Investigation shall also include analysis of the steam distribution system to determine if the pipe sizes must be increased to meet design parameters.

C.	The design must, as a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes 

1.	VA "Design and Construction Procedures"
http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/cPro.asp

2.	VA Design Manuals
i.	Steam Generation Systems Design Manual (including energy center) May 2006
ii.	Outside Steam Distribution Systems Design Manual, May 2006

3.	ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
4.	ASME Code for Pressure Piping
5.	NFPA 54 - Fuel Gas Code
6.	Other NFPA codes i.e. National Electrical Code, Life Safety Code, International Building Codes, and ASHRAE
7.	EPA Environmental Laws including both State of Wyoming and Federal requirements.  The designer will prepare necessary EPA documents for submission by Sheridan VA.

D.	The VA construction budget will be established prior to contract fee negotiation.  

E.	The VA will provide the design firm with the following:

1.	VA Standards and VA Master Specifications in electronic format (MS WORD) are available at the VA website http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard/  Note the VA does not have specification or design documents on coal fired boiler plants and if this option is chosen then the designer will need to provide these documents. 

2.	The VA will provide the Boiler Plant and Steam Distribution study completed for this project.

3.	Access to any drawings or documents from previous boiler projects.  The designer will need to verify accuracy of any of these documents should they be used.  

F.	The boiler plant will be designed to meet the VA requirements for redundancy in the number of boilers (VA requires a minimum of three boilers with sufficient excess capacity that loss of the largest boiler leaves the plant capable of meeting full load).  The boilers shall be capable of burning coal to meet design capacity with  natural gas back up.  The existing gas delivery system will need to be evaluated to insure that it will meet the capacity to supply fuel to the boiler plant.  If the selected boiler system will not fit into the existing plant, the design of a new building or addition to the building will be required.  The appearance of this building will be required to meet the standards of the VA and in appearance and construction.  The building is in the National Historical register and all changes must be approved by the Station Historical Preservation Office.  The design shall be done in a manner that the plant remains operational at all times.  The current boiler plant has both summer and winter loads and operates 24 hours per day 7 days a week.  The design contract will require a detailed phasing plan to accomplish work and maintain steam throughout the construction period.  

	This project will be reviewed at the local level (Sheridan VAMC), regional level (VISN 19), and the national level (Department of Veterans Affairs Construction Facilities Management Office Support Services).

Other work as per drawings and specifications.

There will be NO design services included in this contract.  Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5  ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement.  When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award.  Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required.  And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order.  A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract.  However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer.  Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors. b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect Engineer, AE shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies, office space and supervision required to fully complete each task order. Task Orders issued against the contract awarded under this announcement may be used by other Corps of Engineers Offices. c. Contract Award Procedure: Professional Labor Rates will only be increased once every 12 months and any task order issued at any time within the 12-month period must use the rates of the period in which the task order is executed by the Contracting Officer. New rates go into effect only at the end of the 12 month period. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm Fixed Price contract.

Lack of a defensive system limits the KC-135 operating area which results in increased fuel consumption costs and decreased mission performance. <br />TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: <br />The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution provided in response to this RFI. All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement. For the purposes of this RFI, the concept of operations is to utilize a minimum (smaller) number of IRCM defensive systems that will be rotated among a larger fleet of aircraft. Respondents should indicate based on their proposed solution the "smaller number" of systems that would be required, to include spares, in order to support a larger fleet size as indicated below; assuming that a minimum of 30% of these fleet sizes would require a fully operational system to be installed at any given time. Respondents are to consider the following two fleet sizes as independent discrete efforts: <br />Fleet size "A" = 10 aircraft<br />Fleet Size "B" = 25 aircraft<br />1. The system must have the ability to defend against MANPAD threats. Respondents should indicate if any MANPAD effectiveness evaluations have been performed to on their proposed system. <br />2. The system when installed must have no impact to the KC-135 aircraft's primary mission of refueling other aircraft. <br />3. With the consideration of the above concept of operations; the system should be capable of being removed from one aircraft, transferred, reinstalled and made operational on a different appropriately equipped aircraft with a minimal effort. Respondents should indicate the approximate level of effort in personnel, equipment, and time to accomplish these.<br />4. The system ideally should be self-contained. <br />5. The system should be easily transported. A single shipping container is most desirable. <br />6. The system should have no impact to aircraft flight dynamics. <br />7. The system should be able to operate as a standalone system with no integration to the current aircraft's avionics suite. <br />8. The system should be able to operate autonomously to defeat MANPAD threats without any human intervention. <br />9. The system should not require extensive modification to the main aircraft structure. Ancillary structures may be used for hardware containment and/or attachment. <br />10. The system's mechanical and electrical interface should not interfere with existing aircraft systems. <br />OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: <br />The KC-135 operates within the altitude range of -1000 to 50,000 feet, and at speeds less than 0.95 Mach. The KC-135 internal operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The system must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use.<br />INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: <br />The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC 400-hertz three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28 VDC. DC power is limited respondents solution sets should try to utilize AC power as much as possible. The KC-135 has two 28 VDC batteries for emergency purposes only and will not be utilized for this effort. <br />TECHNICAL APPROACH: <br />Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed system. Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system within the above concept of operations. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address any potential risks. Briefly summarize how personnel would operate and maintain the system to include the on and off aircraft maintenance concept. Describe any training that would be required to operate and maintain the proposed system.
<p>COMPATIBILITY: <br />Explain system compatibility with other fielded systems and USAF support equipment. Respondents should indicate whether any of the components proposed for their system are currently utilized or exist within commercial aviation or the US Government; please specify the using organization, airframe type, national stock number (NSN), and/or part number as applicable. Describe any compatibility limitations between these components. <br />ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING:<br />State the type and level of environmental qualification testing that has been performed on the system. <br />COST:<br />Respondents should provide budgetary cost estimates for non-recurring engineering, testing, technical manuals, operator and maintenance training required to adapt their solution to KC-135 aircraft and a separate budgetary estimate for the "Group- A" equipment and Group-B" equipment that would be required. Also, provide a separate budgetary estimate for any "Group-A" recurring installation hours.<br />Note: <br />Group A equipment would be required to be installed on all of the aircraft of each fleet size. Examples of "Group A": electrical wiring, mounts, attachments, and other items required to accommodate the "Group-B" equipment.</p>
<p>Group-B equipment would be those items the respondent deems could be easily rotated between aircraft and are generally high costs items. The number of "Group-B" systems is to be recommended by the respondent for the two distinct fleet sizes.<br />AVAILABILITY: <br />Provide availability information for the proposed system. Give information detailing the availability of the proposed system, i.e. system is available immediately? If systems are not available provide best availability estimates for the system(s). Based on this information, respondents should provide a tentative schedule estimate based on months to perform the steps required to successfully prototype, test, produce, install, and field the number of systems that would be required given the fleet sizes mentioned above. <br />PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for government/civilian customers similar to what this RFI addresses. <br />RESPONSE:<br />Services to include research and development, technology insertions, system integrations, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support, logistic support services, and engineering support. Respondents may use or propose commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using best processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrade and operational support costs. <br />The information you provide may be used by the USAF to consider planning, program phasing and tailored technical requirements. Your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any manner. Although the identification of contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information that is received as a result of this RFI. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations.<br />Through this RFI the Air Force is soliciting information on mature or emerging technologies which would meet the immediate requirements. This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. All respondents are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.</p>

The CPC is a life support item that requires consistently high standards of manufacturing.  The certification process will include examination of the manufacturing capability and past performance of proposed manufacturers, as well as submitted CPC samples to verify that the material, design and quality requirements of the Joint Product Manager Individual Protection (JPM-IP) Purchase Description (JPMIP-PD-JPACE-01A) can be met by a potential source.  The completed manufacturing capability and past performance questionnaire will be reviewed and evaluated by the Government prior to fabricating samples.  Certification of a potential cut and sew source for the CPC will occur prior to, and independently of, any contract award to that source. Certification of a potential source does not guarantee a contract award.   A general description of the JPACE CPC is attached for information only.  <BR><BR>Interested sources seeking CPC certification shall submit a written request to the Contracting Office at the above address.<BR><BR> <BR>Upon receipt of the written request, the Government will provide the following information to the potential source:<BR>"	JPACE Purchase Description (JPMIP-PD-JPACE-01A) which includes material and component source information <BR>"	JPACE Packaging, Packing and Marking Instruction (JPMIP-PPMI-JPACE-01)<BR>"	Government patterns for required coverall male and female sizes<BR>"	Potential Source Manufacturing Capability Questionnaire <BR><BR>Prior to receiving authorization to submit samples, potential sources shall be required to complete and submit a manufacturing capability summary, based on the information identified in the questionnaire, and a past performance summary which includes:<BR>"	Manufacturing Capability Summary<BR>"	Past Performance Summary<BR>o	Ongoing and Completed Contracts<BR>o	Systematic Improvement Efforts <BR>o	Quality Awards<BR><BR>Any additional information that a potential supplier feels is germane to the review of their capabilities may also be provided as part of the summaries.  While the Government may, at its option, solicit additional information from cited sources, it is not the responsibility of the Government to obtain any information beyond that provided by the vendor.<BR><BR>The Government will review the Manufacturing Capability Summary and Past Performance Summary.  At the Governments option, an on-site inspection of the potential sources facilities will be conducted.  If satisfactory manufacturing capabilities and past performance have been demonstrated, the Government will authorize fabrication of certification samples and will provide additional information necessary for the marking and labeling of samples, as well as the source for materials to be used to fabricate the samples.<BR><BR>When the certification samples are ready for Government evaluation, the potential source seeking certification shall notify the Government in writing. The Government will contact the potential source with shipping instructions for the samples or, at the Governments option, schedule an in-plant evaluation of the sample CPCs.   If the evaluation of the samples is to be conducted on-site at the potential sources plant, the potential source shall provide a suitable area for the Government inspection.   <BR><BR>The Government will complete visual and dimensional examinations in accordance with JPACE CPC inspection criteria in the JPACE Purchase Description (JPMIP-PD-JPACE-01A).  After a successful examination, the certification samples will be retained by the Government and will be subjected to effects of laundering testing.<BR><BR>The cost of the examination and testing of the certification samples will be borne by the Government.  However, if the potential source fails to meet acceptance criteria for certification (see below), any re-submittal of rejected items will be at the option of the Government, and the cost for the Government to re-examine and re-test shall be the responsibility of the potential source seeking certification.<BR><BR>The following criteria shall be met before a vendor is certified to produce the JPACE CPC.<BR><BR>o	Adequate manufacturing capability must be demonstrated.<BR>o	Acceptable past performance on previous contracts must be demonstrated.  <BR>o	Financial viability must be demonstrated.<BR>o	Acceptable Visual and Dimensional Examination results of the certification samples as demonstrated by (number of defects per garment):<BR>o	No protective storage or folding defects  <BR>o	No critical defects<BR>o	No more than two (2) major defects<BR>o	No more than five (5) combined (major and minor) defects<BR>o	Acceptable results on Effects of Laundering test as demonstrated by <BR>o	Shrinkage of 5% or less<BR>o	No critical defects after laundering<BR>The potential source will be notified in writing of the results of the Government examinations and tests.  If all certification acceptance criteria are met, the potential source will be certified and will be placed on the Procurement Control Drawing for the JPACE CPC and will then be eligible for contract award.  Unique Certification Authorization Numbers will be assigned to the certified source for each Type, Class, and Gender of CPC.  Only certified sources listed on the JPACE Chemical Protective Coverall (CPC) Procurement Control Drawing will be eligible for award.  However, certification and listing on the Procurement Control Drawing in no way guarantees a contract award.  Awards will be based on best-value as assessed by the procuring agency.  Certification does not relieve the potential source from responsibility to meet all requirements specified in the JPACE PD (JPMIP-PD-JPACE-01A) and in the contract, does not guarantee acceptability under a contract, and does not waive the requirement for first article inspection or any conformance inspections under a contract.<BR><BR>Firms submitting samples for consideration shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information and samples.  Following the completion of examinations and/or tests, one (1) male and one (1) female coverall sample of those submitted will be retained by the Government regardless of whether or not the potential source is certified.  The remaining samples will be returned to the potential source.  All data provided by the potential source will be retained by the Government. <BR><BR>Respondents must submit their formal written request seeking certification, via the Natick Contracting Center  point of contact, by COB on 16 July 2010.  <BR><BR>Interested sources seeking CPC certification shall submit a written request to the Natick Contracting  Center, ATTN:  Richard Alves, US Army RDECOM-CC, Natick Contracting Division,1 Kansas Street, Natick, MA  01760.

The coverall shall be made in accordance with the Table of Operations in the PD (JPMIP-PD-JPACE-01A).  The manufacturer is not required to follow the exact sequence as listed therein; however, the design and finished measurements shall be maintained, unless written approval for modifications has been provided by the Contracting Officer.  All component parts for each individual coverall shall be cut from the same lot of outer shell and filter fabric lining materials and from the same lot of inner sleeve/inner leg fabric.  The date (month and year) of manufacture of the sorptive lining fabric and the inner sleeve/inner leg fabric shall be tracked along with each cut piece or sewn component of the coverall in which they are used throughout the cutting, sewing, and protective storage bagging operations.  The surveillance markings for the filter fabric lining and the inner sleeve/inner leg fabric, which reflect the dates of manufacture, shall be used on coverall labels and protective unit pack barrier bags as required in the PD.<BR><BR> <BR>Stitches, seams and stitching.  Stitches, seams, and stitching types specified in the JPACE PD shall conform to ASTM D6193.  Whenever two or more methods, seams, or stitches are given for the same part of an operation, any one of them may be used.  Double topstitch is 1/4 inch gauge and 1/16 inch from folded edge<BR><BR>Type 607 stitching.  Stitch type 607 shall be used to join the lining pieces.  When this stitch type is used, the seam allowance is 1/2 inch to allow for trimming of approximately 1/4 inch, which shall be done during formation of the seam.   Type 607 (flat lock), is a six thread (four needle, one looper, one cover) flat lock stitch.  The seam shall be 3/16 (1/16) inch wide and lapped such that a minimum of one needle penetrates through both the top and bottom layer of lap to provide for an even seam without spacing between the overlapped fabric. All flatlock seams shall be constructed so that the raw edges overlap without spacing.   <BR> <BR>Bartacking.  Bartacks shall be 3/8 to 1/2 inch long, and shall contain 28 diagonal stitches minimum.  Bartacks shall be free from thread breaks and loose stitching.<BR><BR>Sewn eyelets.  The sewn eyelets on the right sleeve pocket shall have a minimum of 19 stitches each, and the stitches shall be 101, 301, or 401.  The eyelet size shall be 1/8 to 3/16 inch inside diameter.<BR><BR>Thread breaks and ends of all seams.  Ends of seams and stitches that are not caught in other seams or stitching shall be securely tacked or backstitched not less than 1/2 inch.  Thread breaks or bobbin run-outs shall be secured by starting stitching a minimum of 1/2 inch back of the end of the stitching.  For stitch type 301, the stitching shall be repaired with 301 stitch.  Repairs of types 502, 503, 504 and 607 stitches shall be made with a type 304 stitch.    <BR><BR>In-process repair. There shall be no more than two (2) mends (repairs requiring additional fabric) to the upper body (above the waist) of the outer shell or lining sub-assembly.  There shall be no more than two (2) mends to the lower body (below the waist) of the outer shell or lining sub-assembly.  Mends in the waist area may be counted as mends to either the upper or lower body.  There shall be no more than four (4) mends in the completed coverall.  No mend shall be stitched through all plies (outer shell and lining) of the completed coverall.  Outer shell and lining mends shall not align in the completed coverall.<BR><BR>Outer shell sub-assembly repair.  Open joining seams shall be repaired using 301 stitching.  Stitch 1/2 inch before and after the open area.  Cuts, holes and tears smaller than 1/4 inch may be repaired by fusing a piece of outer shell material which is 3/8 inch larger than the damaged area on all sides to the back of the material.  Use Type 301 stitching to secure this mend to outer shell.   No other critical defects, including cuts, holes and tears 1/4 inch or larger, shall be repaired.<BR><BR>Lining sub-assembly repair.  Skipped stitches shall be repaired using Type 304 stitching, 8-12 stitches per inch and 3/16 inch wide, stitching 1/2 inch before and after the skipped stitches.  Cuts, holes, tears, and needle chews smaller than 1 1/4 inch may be repaired  using a piece of lining material 3/8 inch larger on all sides than the cut, hole, tear or needle chew.  Position the material on the side of the lining that will face the outer shell and stitch around the perimeter of the defect using Type 301 stitching.  Cuts, holes, tears and needle chews greater than 1 1/4 inch shall not be repaired.  Lining sub-assemblies containing critical defects including cuts, holes and tears greater than 1 1/4 inch shall not be repaired and the lining sub-assembly shall be discarded.  Open seams less than 1 1/4 inch may be repaired by inserting a strip of lining material cut the length of the opening and 1 inch wide.  Position the patch in the open seam of the lining.  Stitch over the open seam and material using Type 304 stitching which extends 1/2 inch before and after the repair area.  Excess material on each side shall be trimmed close to stitching.  Open seams 1 1/4 inch or longer shall not be repaired.  Abrasions of the lining cover material where the carbon beads have not been exposed and which are smaller than 1 1/4 inch may be repaired using a fusible non-woven material proved by the approved material source as listed in the PD (see 6.14).  The non-woven material shall overlap the repair area 1/4 inch in all directions and shall be heat sealed in place using preheated dry iron set at polyester heat setting.  Abrasions of the lining cover material where the carbon beads have been exposed or abrasions of the lining cover material 1 1/4 inch or larger shall not be repaired.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR>FIGURE A1.

<DESC>This is an 8(a) and Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) sources and Small Business; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered an 8(a) and Small Business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>CMS intends to award a 2 year consulting contract to provide the agency with both short-run (10 year) and long-range (75 year) macroeconomic projections. The projections will be used in production of short-run projections of National Health Expenditures (NHE) and production of the annual report of the Medicare Trustees. Projections may also be required in support of presentations to be made to a DHHS technical panel to be convened in late 2010 to consider methods for projecting long-range aggregate health expenditures.</p>
<p>The prospective vendor must have access to a detailed structural/sectoral model of the U.S. economy equipped to make 75-year economic projections and a demonstrated ability to adapt that model to the needs of the agency in short-turnaround times. A standard scenario will involve projecting the economy-wide implications of an assumed path of growth for the U.S. health sector. Multifactor productivity projections plausibly aligned with historic BLS series will also be required. Another important requirement is multidimensional consistency of outputs with historical aggregates.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Please Demonstrate an ability to:</p>
<p>(1) Standard Scenario</p>
<p>A standard macroeconomic scenario calibrated to replicate a state of the world in which SSA economic and demographic assumptions and CMS assumptions about the path of health sector expenditure/aggregate demand all hold.</p>
<p>(2) Support for NHE 10-year projections.</p>
<p>The short-run projections of National Health Expenditures (NHE) require projections of key macroeconomic variables including: growth in gross domestic product (GDP), overall price growth, and disposable personal income (DPI) growth. With the exception of DPI, the Social Security Administration (SSA) develops assumptions for these macroeconomic variables and, in principle, the CMS 10-year NHE projection should be consistent with these assumptions. Output for this task will require updating because the timing of the NHE short term projections is such that when NHE work begins the SSA economic assumptions are already several months old. As work proceeds, the assumptions are updated via discussions with SSA economists and examinations of the latest commercial and government forecasts and final supporting projections of a consistent DPI series will be generated.</p>
<p>(3) Economy-wide private non-farm business multi-factor productivity estimates.</p>
<p>The vendor will provide a forecast of annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity in the aggregate and by major business sectors (MFP) for the years 2009 through 2019; provide specific documentation regarding the method(s) used to develop this forecast; provide an evaluation of how well the model aligns to the historical series of private nonfarm business MFP as published by the BLS. The PPACA requires use of forecasts of this series in updating Medicare fee-for-service payments and CMS/OACT is interested in receiving a detailed forecast of this series in order to evaluate alternative expectations of future productivity growth. The vendor will also report on its view of the long-range trends in these series consistent with its overall economic modeling effort.</p>
<p><br />(4) Support for OACT work in connection with technical panel about long-range projections.</p>
<p>Later this year the Secretary of HHS is convening on behalf of the Medicare Trustees a technical panel to evaluate methods for projecting long-range medical expenditures. As with annual work on the report of the Medicare Trustees, it is expected that special scenarios will need to be produced for the technical panel in order to illustrate implications of the long-range medical expenditure projections, including possible implications of health reform legislation.</p>
<p>(5) 75-year medical spending projections.</p>
<p>The vendor will provide ongoing support to CMS in developing 75 year projections of the health sector and the economy. This support will include: (a) 75-year simulations of the health sector and the economy under alternative assumptions (including assumptions generated by the OACT computable general equilibrium (CGE) model); (b) analysis of the economic implications of different financing options of government medical expenditures (e.g., increasing government deficits, increasing taxes); (c) analysis of Input-Output data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in support of the CGE model. A new aspect of long-range projections in coming years will be modeling the long-range effects of health reform legislation.</p>
<p>(6) SIC to NAICS conversion.</p>
<p>If the production sectors of the vendor's model are currently the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, no later than October 15, 2011 the vendor shall arrange to rebase its model using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) so that all projections for the 2012 reporting year will be consistent with the current National Income and Product Account and Input-Output data.</p>
<p>(7) Extending the range of substantive issues to be investigated with scenarios</p>
<p>Subsequent to award of the contract the vendor in consultation with CMS shall develop a plan for production of scenarios intended to investigate the following types of issues:</p>
<p>a) Developing a broader macroeconomic and industrial context for the annual Trustees' projections.</p>
<p>b) Developing alternative projections given different rates of growth for productivity and the labor force.</p>
<p>c) Evaluating the fiscal and economic sustainability of the long-term health care projections such as by calibrating scenarios similar to those specified by the Committee on the Fiscal Future of the United States in Choosing the Nation's Fiscal Future (National academies Press, 2010) (Necessarily scenarios along these lines may require deviations from standard agency economic assumptions and current law perspectives.)</p>
<p>d) Investigating the impacts of technology, such as electronic health care records, on the demand, supply, and sustainability of health care expenditures, using microeconomic studies to quantify the industry-level impacts.</p>
<p>e) Assessing the industry and macroeconomic effects of alternative health policies, such as different cost-sharing schemes or the elimination of inefficient spending, that have been quantified at the product or industry level by various microeconomic studies.</p>
<p>f) Developing new data estimates for the differential levels of employer-sponsored health benefits offered across industries. (This effort would require the mining of other data sets, especially non-government data.)</p>
<p>g) Expanding the NIPA-NHE correspondence to include a funding source dimension to the crosswalk. This dimension will help us to trace how funding source might affect the choice of expenditure and vice-versa.</p>
<p>h) Other issues pertinent to long-range projection of health expenditures and their implications as agreed upon by CMS and the contractor.</p>
<p>i) Investigating the long-range implications/feasibility of differential cost growth rates in subparts of the U.S. health sector, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance, particularly in light of health reform legislation.</p>
<p>CMS also requests the following additional information:</p>
<p>Business Information:</p>

<DESC>NOTE:  This RFI is a combination of the two previously posted RFI: DOL-RFI-2010-1001, Random Assignment Impact Evaluation and DOL-RFI-2010-2002, High Growth/Health Care Evaluation.  The U.S. Department of Labor has decided to combine the two procurements. 

The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking qualified contractors to conduct a random assignment evaluation of the impacts on participants post-program employment and education outcomes of training provided under grants awarded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds under the Green Jobs Solicitations for Grant Applications (SGAs) and the High Growth/Health Care SGA.  The Green Jobs grants were awarded in January, 2010, under three SGAs: the Energy Training Partnerships grants, the State Energy Sector Partnership and Training grants, and the Pathways Out of Poverty grants. The High Growth /Health Care grants were awarded February, 2010.  The SGAs can be found at http://www.doleta.gov/grants/2009grants.cfm, and the announcements of awards can be found at: http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20100177.htm and http://www.dol.gov/dol/green/.

The Green Jobs and High Growth / Health Care evaluation will involve five to ten grantees.  It will track the study sample for at least three years from the point of random assignment, and will take approximately five years to complete. 

ETA is conducting market research to identify firms that qualify under the Small Business Programs mentioned in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 19.  The NAICS Code is 541611, and the Small Business Standard is $7 million.  The contractor will be responsible for estimating the impacts of the training provided by the grantees on participants post-program earning, employment and certification outcomes, overall and for key subgroups.  Activities undertaken as part of this contract include, but are not limited to, developing the evaluation design, collecting and analyzing data (including administering a large-scale survey), convening meetings, preparing analytical reports, and providing briefings to executive-level federal staff.  The contractor must be able to design an appropriate, rigorous, and feasible random assignment impact evaluation; execute the evaluation; and prepare reports based on the data analysis.

All contractors responding to this announcement must demonstrate their experience in successfully doing the aforementioned work.  Please be advised that the following factors will be used to gauge the capability of a firm who responds to this request for information.  Therefore, a firms capabilities statement should address:

1) 	Serving as lead investigator for developing a design for a large-scale multi-part random assignment impact study; 

2)	Providing in-house administration of a CATI survey to a minimum of 4,000 respondents, with a minimum of an 80 percent response rate;

3)	Designing and conducting an implementation evaluation to support a random assignment impact study, including focus groups, site visits and qualitative analysis;

4)	Developing documents to support the Paperwork Reduction Act clearance process;

5)	Implementing strategies to minimize attrition in longitudinal impact evaluations;

6)	Analyzing and synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data for a large-scale multi-part random assignment impact study;

7)	Developing a high-quality final evaluation report on a large-scale multi-part random assignment impact study;

8)	Designing and administering random assignment as part of an impact evaluation involving 4,000 subjects (treatments and controls), at a minimum, including experience and ability to receive, handle, protect and dispose of data that may contain personally identifiable information, as pertains to federal regulations, the Privacy Act, FERPA, etc.; and

9)	Serving as the primary or lead presenter in oral briefings to executive-level staff.

All interested parties are invited to submit a capabilities statement, to Ms. Dayle White, Contract Specialist, Division of Contract Services, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N4655, Washington, DC 20210.

<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Clark MacDill Design Build LLC, 4401 Wilson Blvd. Suite 600, Arlington VA 22203. The 6th Civil Engineer Squadron requests the installation of security cameras in the privatized housing area for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM). In particular these security cameras will support 27 General Officers (GO) and 26 Senior Officers (SO) which were built in the privatized housing area by Clark Realty as part of their 50 year housing privatization lease agreement with the Government. The contractor shall design, engineer, furnish, fabricate, install, test and maintain new security camera system including the integration of the system with the Security Forces Squadron Control Center. Installation of a minimum four (4) each pan-tilt-zoom cameras, system shall include incident recording system, lightning protection, mounting poles, wiring components, accessories and 1-year maintenance agreement. It is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs. In addition, other alternatives were looked at with other agencies to have this accomplished however because of the proprietary design data and the high duplications of costs, it is in the best interest of the Government to have Clark MacDill Builders perform this additional yet interrelated work. Clark owns the proprietary design data for the underground systems. To avoid substantial cost duplication the Government must be ready to execute installing the system alongside the project owner's underground utilities along Bayshore Drive. This requirement will have a Period of Performance with an estimated 100 calendar days to complete this project. The 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) has the responsibility of providing base support to Headquarters, USCENTCOM in accomplishing its mission. To continue to provide the communications support required, the security cameras must be extended into the privatized housing area. USCENTCOM has a valued interest in this requirement, because it will provide senior leadership with twenty-four hour security of key personnel.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System is 236220 and the size standard is $33.5M. "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. The 6th Contracting Squadron will post this notice until 1:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 28 June 2010 and intends to award a sole source contract after expiration of this notice. Note: No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<DESC>VA Building 1 Solicitation VA-241-10-RA-0086, Question Responses

1.	We could not find a complete list of all the contract drawings listed anywhere in the specifications so we are unsure if we have all of the required drawings. Response 1  See additional drawings and specifications.

2.	We have drawings 111, 112, 116, 117 but cannot find 113, 114, 115 on the FBO Website We do not see any plumbing drawings on the FBO website. Response 2  See additional drawings and specifications.

3.	The T-1 drawing lists some of the drawings but does not include A10, A11, S1, S2, S3 for the 11C Ramp work. Response 3  See additional drawings and specifications.

4.	Since this project is a renovation, does the VA have a contingency fee set-up? If not, what happens when a contractor opens up a wall and finds some unforeseen condition such as asbestos that is not listed on the abatement schedule? We are not able to proceed with any unauthorized work so in essence, that particular bathroom would come to a stop. Response 4  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

5.	Once unforeseen extra work is found, what is the normal amount of time that the VA takes to secure funding and process the modification? Response 5  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

6.	We see that the working hours are from 8:00 until 4:30? Do you expect any of the work to be done after or before those hours? Response 6  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

7.	Part of the work entails jack hammering out concrete from the floors. This noise will reverberate throughout the entire hospital. Will the contractor be stopped at any time because of the noise? The posted limit of noise is not to exceed 70? decibels. Jack hammering concrete will certainly exceed that tolerance. Will jack hammers be allowed or should other method of removing the concrete be used? Response 7  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

8.	Wall type 4 calls for 4" solid block but shows a drawing of 6" block. Please clarify. If wall type 4 is 4 solid block, then the piping shown running in the walls wont work. Response 8  Delete note ONE HOUR RATED WALL 4 SOLID CMU BLOCK SIM. U.L. 901 for Wall Type 3 and Wall Type 4.

9.	Are all water closets to be wall mounted? If so, there are several bathrooms that dont have a chase to provide space for a carrier. Response 9  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

10.	Will all construction areas be turned over to the contractor when the contract is awarded or will the bathrooms be phased? Response 10  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

11.	The specifications state that the contractor must abide by OS11A 1910 and OS11A 1926. Contractors employee protection is defined under OS11A 1926 whereas the VAs employees are protected under OS11A 1910. The contractor cant be held accountable to abide by all of OS11A 1910 since that is the Governments responsibility not the contractors. If the Government feels the contractor is putting the VA employees in danger due to some construction activity, it is up to the government to protect their employees through some action such as moving them away from the potential hazard. The contractor cant be held responsible for moving the VA employees since we are not their employer. Response 11  Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

12.	There are no specs other than whats on the drawings..there are hardware sets on A13 but no manufactures numbers to establish a standard of quality.what do we furnish? Response 12  See additional drawings and specifications.

13.	Who furnishes the hardware for the aluminum doors? Response 13  See additional drawings and specifications.

14.	What is the veneer on the wood doors. If they say match existing, we need to know what the existing veneer is. Response 14  See additional drawings and specifications.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><p>CONTRACT INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a paper solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation number is MCC-10-0102-RFP-45, and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), with incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41. A firm-fixed price (FFP) contract is anticipated. The period of performance is three (3) months. This requirement is being synopsized under the North American Industry Classification System code 541519 - Other Computer Related Services, and the size standard is $25M. This requirement is also set-aside to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses pursuant to FAR 6.206 and 19.1405.</p>
<p>This is a requirement for Independent Verification &amp; Validation (IV&amp;V) Services. Offerors need to be aware that the requirements of IV&amp;V on this project do not necessarily conform to industry standard practices for verification and validation as defined in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard for Software Verification and Validation (IEEE Standard 1012-2004). The IEEE standard describes software verification &amp; validation (V&amp;V) processes as generally determining if development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity, and if the software satisfies the intended use and user needs. In other words, the IEEE standard answers the dual question, "... did we build the product right, and did we build the right product?" As defined in the IEEE standards, V&amp;V processes include activities such as assessment, analysis, measurement, inspection, and testing of software products and processes. These IV&amp;V processes further include assessing software in the context of the system, including the operational environment, hardware, interfacing software, operators, and users. The IEEE standard seeks to assure that software V&amp;V is performed in parallel with software development, not intermittently or at the conclusion of the software development.</p>
<p>However, the requirements for the MCC Integrated Data Analysis System (MIDAS) system are limited in their scope from the industry standard IEEE definition for V&amp;V in two (2) key regards:</p>
<p>a. IV&amp;V of the MIDAS project is not considered to be an integral process within the larger development project. Rather, it is considered to be an adjunct activity that does not fall within the managerial oversight or control of the day-to-day operation of the project's management structure. The IV&amp;V Service Provider must maintain organizational independence and autonomy from the project's organization, and therefore has a reduced role from that normally associated with full IV&amp;V services.</p>
<p>b. In performing the "audit" of the MIDAS program, the IV&amp;V Service Provider shall provide its' detailed, structured reports of findings of deficiencies and recommendations to MCC. This reporting process includes not only final report issuance, but all draft report submissions as well.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Vendors are invited to provide a proposal for line items 0001-0010. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: The vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Governments stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art micro analytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes, reference materials and polymer microspheres with encapsulated explosives. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the capability to separate and detect explosive mixtures with high sensitivity and precision needed for validating trace explosives in liquid solutions. The proposed system is a critical and integral part of the standards development program for trace detection. A liquid chromatographic system is needed for precise separation and trace detection of explosives in a variety of complex matrices such as explosive mixtures and/or separation of explosives from polymer solutions.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>General Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The system must be able to separate and detect trace explosives in liquids.</p>
<p>2. The proposed system shall not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement. However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.</p>
<p>3. The system must have an auto sampler, sample and column heater/cooler, solvent pump, fraction collector, and PDA detector with a dynamic range of 10 - 10,000 microgram per milliliter.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The analytes cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), poly (lactic-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polystyrene butadiene must be separable and detectable below 10 micrograms in each of the following solvents: acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol, isobutanol, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and dichloromethane.</p>
<p>2. For all required analytes, reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 microgram level must be less than or equal to 2% RSD.</p>
<p>3. The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. Technical Capability is more important than Past Performance. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>The proposed system shall not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement. However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.<br /><br />Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>Visual and physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications:<br />1. Detection device is based on UV technology.<br />2. Detection device utilizes LC sampling system.<br />3. The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />4. Interfaced to an Applied Biosystems triple quad.</p>
<p>Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications:<br />1. Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes in solution at twice the LOD as specified by the supplier. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately separate and identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five (5) times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art micro analytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes, reference materials and polymer microspheres with encapsulated explosives. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the capability to separate and detect explosive mixtures with high sensitivity and precision needed for validating trace explosives in liquid solutions. The proposed system is a critical and integral part of the standards development program for trace detection. A liquid chromatographic system is needed for precise separation and trace detection of explosives in a variety of complex matrices such as explosive mixtures and/or separation of explosives from polymer solutions.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Liquid Chromatographic System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>General Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The system must be able to separate and detect trace explosives in liquids.</p>
<p>2. The proposed system shall not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement. However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.</p>
<p>3. The system must have a thermostatted auto sampler, sample and column heater/cooler, quaternary solvent pump, solvent degasser and PDA detector.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>1. For analytes, the reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 microgram level must be less than or equal to 5% RSD.</p>
<p>2. The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. Technical Capability is more important than Past Performance. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>

However, the system must be compatible and able to be interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-Trap.<br />Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>Visual and physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications:<br />1. Detection device is based on UV technology.<br />2. Detection device utilizes LC sampling system.<br />3. The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.<br />4. Interfaced to an Applied Biosystems triple quad.</p>
<p>Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications:<br />1. Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes in solution at twice the LOD as specified by the supplier. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately separate and identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five (5) times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses.</p>

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) in support of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG&reg;) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number RECOVERY - ARRAOS: ST10-1094 for an initiative called, "Quality Assurance Support for the Janus Software Development Project and the Janus Phase 3 Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA." <br />
<p><strong>PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM EDT JULY 2, 2010.&nbsp; EMAIL QUESTIONS AND/OR CLARIFICATIONS IN WRITING TO THE POINT OF CONTACT NAMED ABOVE BY 12:00 PM EDT JUNE 21, 2010.<br /></strong><br />The scope of this project is to acquire Subcontractor support to provide Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus software development project; Janus Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA ARRAOS (Janus Phase III) and whose main scope and objectives are described below for context. The work includes comprehensive testing and QA support for all aspects and phases of the Janus Phase III project. Application functionality testing and testing of interfaces to other systems, as well as, relevant Enterprise Services in the caBIG Service Portfolio. A more specific project service list will grow throughout the project lifecycle, and is being added to project documentation and deliverables accessible at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus-iii/, and is within scope of this request. <br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology Quality Assurance (NCI CBIIT QA) staff oversee's the analysis, coordination, planning and facilitation of quality test plans and quality testing for the quality assurance (QA) environments designated by each application project's plan, and implemented by selected independent QA contractor(s), NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that the selected independent QA contractor adheres to all NCI CBIIT policies and procedures, uses the testing paradigms and standards that are acceptable to NCI CBIIT, and provides communication to NCI leadership regarding best /avoid practices and the overall health of the project quality. NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that through the selected independent QA contractor the final application and services will provide acceptable functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability, as well as oversight and review of certification and accreditation of systems.<br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology has been actively defining, designing, developing, and deploying key infrastructure and application-level components of the IT fabric necessary to support the 21st-Century vision for integrated Biomedical Research, Translational Medicine and Personalized Health Management, a composite environment and context often referred to as the " Oncology Knowledge Cloud." In particular, the Knowledge Cloud is being developed with a focus on developing and deploying reference implementations of specifications developed to support and enable "Business Interoperability" between stakeholders throughout the Knowledge Cloud. In particular, development activities are focused on utilizing a variety of standards that support technical interoperability, as well as on utilizing a number of Best Practices drawn from the collective experiences in both the commercial and open-source software engineering communities. The software components deployed by CBIIT will be based on a commitment to open-source, open-access development with the goal of promoting the maximum amount of sharing and integration. In addition, however, components will be specified in such a manner so as to enable bindings to non-CBIIT technology platforms in other commercial or open-source implementations.<br />It is anticipated that the Janus development project will process legacy and newly created Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) study data sets as submissions, validate the submission against standard rules and automate the processing of the SDTM datasets from the time they are made available for loading from FDA's electronic document rooms (EDR) through their validation and loading into the Janus clinical study data repository. In addition, the Janus development project will enhance the Janus database (to v 2.0) to a more robust database design and improved analytical and visualization functions. <br />The QA of all associated development iterations and releases will be required in appropriate testing environments to move to next step in the development and deployment lifecycle, as determined by project team and project management plan. <br />In progress, are the gathering of requirements and system design documents for Janus phase 3 system, including the 2.0 database model and a SDTM Validation Service (which will automatically load new SDTM datasets into a staging area, perform SDTM validation checks, generate error reports describing all errors, and send them to FDA-designated recipients) from extension of the Janus Phase II pilot.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to provide all aspects of Software Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus system throughout its full software development lifecycle. In this request the subcontractor is asked to provide a variety of management and QA services including but not limited to: <br />(a) Work with development teams to produce and maintain appropriate QA and testing plans for new releases of software: <br />(b) Work with development teams and end users to produce test cases: <br />(c) Conduct integration testing, regression and staging testing of software prior to release: <br />(d) Test case automation: <br />(e) Assist with user acceptance testing of software prior to release: <br />(f) Support for Bug Fixes: <br />(g) Troubleshoot Data Issues: <br />(h) Deliver Test Reports: <br />(i) Formal systems validation is not included within the scope of this request.<br />(j) As the system may be validated in the future any design or errors that would prevent or hinder validation known, or anticipated, should be brought to the attention of the project manager for consideration in development.<br />&bull; Test the Phase 3 operational pilot's ability to function as a study data warehouse to support comparative effectiveness analysis of clinical trials data. Using test data provided by FDA identify errors and operational deficiencies.</p>
<p><br />Design and development of the system will be performed by a separate subcontractor under a separate contract. It is expected that the awardee(s) of this contract will interact with the development and architecture teams and any open source developers, to insure all found errors and bugs are eliminated, as part of this QA work; or formulate mitigation strategies (plans), to be designed and approved , by both FDA and NCI.</p>

<p>Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The Government expects to award a firm fixed price commercial purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to this notice will be the most advantageous to the Government. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. Best value is expected to result from the selection of the technically acceptable quote with the lowest evaluated price. Technical acceptability will be based on the offeror providing a quote that satisfactorily meets the technical requirements stated in the Scope of Work paragraph above.<br /><br />This contract evaluation and award is a streamlined evaluation and award conducted pursuant to FAR 12.602, FAR 13.106-2, and Subpart 13.5.

Accordingly, this contract evaluation and award is not being conducted using formal source selection procedures of FAR Subpart 15.3. The Government has not drafted a formal evaluation plan and does not plan to utilize procedures such as competitive range determinations, oral or written discussions with all offerors within a competitive range. The Government will strive to evaluate each offeror's initial quote fairly, evenly, and in accordance with the solicitation's evaluation criteria. Thus, the offeror's initial quote material should be clear, complete, demonstrate the offeror's full understanding of contract requirements and contain the offeror's best terms, conditions, and prices.<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>

<p>1. Each quote that meets the requirements of this solicitation will be evaluated. Evaluations are based on the Offeror's quote.<br />2.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offers at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all Offerors; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting a quote determined by the Contracting Officer to be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>In order to be considered for award, the offeror's technical proposal must be rated as acceptable. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must demonstrate in their quote that they can meet the requirements as stated in the attached Statement of Work. Failure to submit any of the listed requirements will result in the offeror's technical proposal being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation. Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 13.106-2 to determine price reasonableness.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract.

CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin"><br />ADDENDUM - USAF Academy Invoicing Instruction (Revised 4/23/08)<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin"><br />a.

<DESC>***<br />6/14/2010: Modify part (iv) NAICS code.&nbsp; Change FROM 541330 Engineering Services TO 334220 Radio &amp; TV Broadcasting... See Below Part (iv) for more details.<br />***<br /><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />(ii) This Solicitation Number BBG50-10- 4669 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP), that will result in multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards for broadcast technical services on a Task Order basis to one or more qualified contractor(s).<br /><br />(iii) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41 effective April 13, 2010.<br /><br />(iv) The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that there are at least two qualified small businesses capable of performing the work.  Therefore, pursuant to FAR 19.502-2(b), this procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334220 and size standard is 750. <br /><br />(v) The Contractor shall provide the supplies and/or services described in each individual Task Order.  Each Task Order will have its own unique SOW that will specify the work to be performed, the location or locations of the work, the schedule for completion of work, the deliverables, the acceptance criteria, and any special requirements.  The Firm-Fixed-Price and Delivery Schedule for each Task Order will be negotiated and agreed to prior to commencement of work.  <br /><br />(vi) The Scope of Work tasks consist of 8 different Task Areas, which are described in more detail in the attached Statement of Work dated June 10, 2010.  The Government makes no guarantee as to the exact number of Task Orders or actual dollar amount of services that will, in fact, be requested during the term of the contract.  The annual estimated maximum amount of services anticipated for all of the Task Orders that will be awarded under all of the contracts on this "Multiple Award" Schedule is approximately $4,000,000.<br /><br />(vii) The period of performance is one year with four (unpriced) Option years, which may be exercised by the Government.<br /><br />(viii) The provision at FAR Subpart 52.212-1 [Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items] applies to this acquisition, with no addenda.<br /><br />(ix) The provision at FAR Subpart 52.212-2 [Evaluation of Commercial Items] is hereby incorporated by reference into this combined synopsis/solicitation.  The Written Technical Proposals will be evaluated in three equally-weighted areas (a) Capability (e.g. personnel) (b) Approach and (c) Experience/ Past Performance as follows: <br /><br />(a) Capability: (e.g. personnel):  Offerors shall describe their corporate capability to perform the work via resumes of key-personnel.
<p>(b) Approach:  The Government will assess the technical merit of the Offeror's approach in order to determine if the Offeror has the ability to successfully perform the task areas specified in the SOW.  The Offeror's Technical Proposal will be evaluated on how well it responds to the understanding of the task areas of the SOW.</p>
<p>(c) Experience/Past Performance: The IBB will assess the relevancy of the Offeror's experience/past performance to determine the Offeror's ability to perform the work requirements of the SOW. Offerors shall submit evidence of their experience in performing work within the scope of the Task Areas specified in the Statement of Work. For each Task Area the Offeror wants to be considered for, Offerors shall submit examples of no fewer than two (2) of their most recent or ongoing contracts relating to the work specified in each Task Area. For each contract cited, Offerors shall summarize the technical characteristics of the supplies or services, provided duration, and the dollar volume of the effort. If applicable, Offerors shall provide information regarding predecessor companies, identify personnel who have relevant experience, and/or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the work cited.  Offerors are therefore required to submit current and complete references (i.e, name, voice phone number, and e-mail) of prior customers who may be contacted to provide evidence of the Offeror's successful past performance.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors shall submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR Subpart 52.212-3 [Offeror representations and certifications -- commercial items] with their proposal.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 5

Please see the following list of questions and responses.

Q.  We have a contract where we provide an opinion by abstract then have a separate issuance fee for the commitment.  When you potentially have multiple abstracts this could be difficult to price.  Would you consider modifying the pricing structure to accommodate this?
A.  Please see the current version of the price schedule as detailed in amendment 4.  As it stands there is one title insurance commitment fee per easement and the title exam fee is per abstract (with one line item being for the base fee and one abstract and the second line item being for each additional abstract).  We are looking for only one opinion.  Each vendor structures there pricing differently and I cannot change the price schedule for each eventuality.  No other vendors have raised this issue so it will remain unchanged at this time.  You will have to find a method to allocate cost based on the existing pricing schedule. 

Q.  Who prepares the WED and any subordination agreements?
A.  The NRCS prepares the warranty deed and it is provided to our vendors.  Any documents requiring clearance are not separately priced.  Once the items that must be cured are identified we would negotiate a fair and reasonable price for the additional work and a modification would be issued prior to the additional work starting.

Q.  Are we correct in understanding that any curative work that needs to be done will be handled and priced separately on an as needed basis?
A.  Yes.  Please see response to the third question.

Q.  Usually recording fees are paid on a per page basis.  How many pages are you assuming in order to price the recording fees?  Are will held to the quote for these fees?  Usually the fees for recording are reimbursable at actual cost with a recording receipt from the recorders office.  
A.  The total number of pages will vary depending on what curative documents must be prepared.  Our standard warranty deed and the states easement agreement are usually about 9 and 3 pages each respectively.  The number for curative documents will vary by easement.  These costs would be included in the modification scope of work mentioned in the response to the third question.  
 
Q.  Usually the fees for the title premium are reimbursable at actual cost based on the rates filed in the state.  Is that the case here?  
A.  It is our experience that firms have rates that are established and consistently applied.  For this contract only easements in the state of MN will be executed.  As such, rates per $1000 of property value need to be priced.  Also, this is similar to other contract price schedules that have been issued by other federal agencies.  I could see the need to provide separate line item pricing by state if we were dealing with multiple states.   

Q.  Minnesota is generally not an abstract state.  Why are we providing pricing in this manner?
A.  Our easement specialist who has worked here for years has said that it is extremely rare for homeowners in this state to not have an abstract.  Abstracts are worked on nearly every day by our service providers.

Q.  We did not see an SF form to sign when submitting our proposal.  Does this contract not require one?
A.  This is a combined synopsis solicitation issued in accordance with FAR 12.603 and paragraph (b) of this section states the SF 1449 is not used for the solicitation.

Q.  Can our proposal be faxed or emailed to your attention?
A.  Yes.  The solicitation does not prohibit this.  See 52.212-1 Instructions to OfferorsCommercial Items for additional guidance.  I would recommend confirming receipt of your proposal if you chose one of these methods to ensure that it was delivered. 

Q.  How many copies are required to be submitted?
A.  Only 1 original is required.  No copies are needed.



AMENDMENT 3
CHANGES
All requirements for developing new abstracts when they do not exist have been removed from this statement of work and solicitation.  If an abstract does not exist the individual landowners will need to contract directly with a service provider to have an abstract developed.  The requirement to update existing abstracts remains within the scope of this solicitation and any resultant contract.  See the attached Statement of Work, Revision 3, which reflects these changes.  Additionally, this amendment removes line items 002, 009, and 016 Developing New Abstract from bid schedule listed in this notice.



RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS
Q.  With regards to the past performance and references do you only want contact information from specific files or is it ok to obtain letters of recommendations from lenders we do a large volume of business for and our title insurance underwriters?
A.  The past performance references can be from the specific files referenced in the prior experience factor or can be from other firms.  However, the past performance references should be from customers of yours that you have provided similar services to as you would be doing under any resultant contract from this solicitation.


Q. Am I correct in thinking that these past files can be from files that involved any type of an easement (i.e. driveway easement, wetland easement, conservation, utility easements)?
A.  Yes.  Any type of easement would be acceptable.


Q.  With regards to the wage determination you indicated that we should use the Administrative Assistant category.  If we have an employee who will be spending some of their time on this contract and their wage does not reflect this amount, can we have them keep track of the time spent on these transactions and compensate them by paying them the additional amount only for these hours? 
A.  Correct.  They only need to be compensated at the rates in the wage determination for time spent on work under any potential contract.  Also, please note that I issued an amendment to the notice on the www.fbo.gov website.  A portion of it deals with this issue and is as follows.

Service Contract Act Wage Determinations
Due to the fact that specific occupational code titles are not listed for real estate transaction professionals, the Administrative Support and Clerical Occupations codes such as 01020, 01051, 01052, 01111, 01112, or 01113 as the offeror deems appropriate. If an offeror does not believe that any of these titles are appropriate, they should request a conformance action as detailed on the last page of each wage determination. This includes providing proposed occupational title(s) and proposed rate(s) with their offer.


Q.  I noticed on the bottom of the wage determination that all occupations must receive the following benefits.  Health and Welfare $3.35 per hour.  I'm assuming that this is above and beyond the wage amount?  Is this also something that we can compensate additionally only for the time spent on this contract?  
A.  Yes.  This is above and beyond the wage determination rate and is only for those hours spent on work under any potential contract.  It can be paid in cash or in the form of health and welfare benefits.


Q.  How can the health and welfare benefit requirement be paid?   
A.    See the following link from the US Dept of Labor regarding discharging an obligation to pay fringe benefits.  
http://www.dol.gov/dol/allcfr/title_29/part_4/29CFR4.175.htm
See section V for additional information.
http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/web/SCA_FAQ.htm


Q.  What about a subcontractor that we hire?  If we order abstract services from another vendor do we have to make sure that they are paying their employees this amount?  Are we required to obtain Errors and Omissions information from them?  
A.  Service Contract Act requirements to apply to both contractors and subcontractors.  See the following link.  Recordkeeping requirements are also mentioned on the website.  Unlike the Davis-Bacon Act which applies to labor practices in construction contracts, agencies that award contracts under the Service Contract Act do not routinely require submission of payroll records.  However, the DOL may as part of any audits they chose to conduct.  In construction contracts offices such as ours are required to obtain and review payroll records routinely.
http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-sca.htm


Q.  Are we permitted to utilize 40 year searches instead of creating new abstracts for these transactions?
A.  Most landowners we contract with have abstracts and we have them updated by vendors if needed.  If an abstract is not present at all, which is rare, the landowner must contract directly with a service provider to have new one developed.   Regarding the time frame for records search all pertinent records should be searched when updating an abstract.  Applicable standards are listed in the notice and are found at http://www.justice.gov/enrd/2001_Title_Standards.html.  Paragraph 5b states: In general, certificates of title and title insurance policies based upon a search of all records affecting the title and unqualified as to the period of search are preferred and should be issued."  While paragraph 3b mentions a minimum number of years, it is recommended that the standard at 5b be applied and that "all records affecting the title and unqualified as to the period of search."  This could exceed the timeframes listed in 3b and serves to help protect all interested parties.


Q.  What additional documents will be required to be signed at closing?
A.  Typical documents required at closing are the WRP Deed (NRCS) and the RIM Easement (State of Minnesota) which we provide and any documents required to cure all encumbrances specified by the NRCS.  These are the same documents that will typically need to be recorded.





AMENDMENT 2
CHANGES
The Statement of Work is revised to specify the location where closings will take place (see page 3 of 5, bottom).
Closings will be held at the local NRCS Field Office closest to the location of the easement property which is generally located in each county.  Any exceptions to the location will be identified by the easement specialist.

Revise Proposed Contract Base Performance Period
Text is changed to beginning approximately July 1, 2010, or the date of contract award, whichever is latest, through June 30, 2011 (changed from September 30, 2010).  The two option periods of one year each remain unchanged.  This change also requires that clause 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, be changed.  The time period is paragraph (c) is changed to 6 months and 3 years.  The date at clause 52.216-18, Ordering, must also change from 9/30/2010 to 6/30/11.  Clause 452.211-75, Effective Period of Contract, must also be changed from 9/30/2010 to 6/30/11.  

Increase is Maximum Order Obligation
The number of projects listed at clause 52.216-19, Ordering Limitations, paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are changed from ten (10) to thirty (30).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the above described procurement.
<p>As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles. Part of this implementation involves sharing the ground floor space for other test enclosures, which consumes the current vehicle parking area.</p>
<p>The US EPA NVFEL (National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory) in Ann Arbor, Michigan provides certification conformity tests for motor vehicles. As part of the test sequence process, vehicles are preconditioned and then parked in a temperature controlled soak area for 12-36 hours to stabilize before the emissions test is done. This soak area has 20 feet of clear height under 90" deep roof girders that are set on 10' centers. This space would enable the stacking of multiple levels of vehicles in order to optimize the storage/soak and test capacity of the limited soak floor area.</p>
<p>Standard vehicle lifts have been used in the automotive industry for this purpose. This document details the dimensions and specifications requirements for the triple lift structures that could be installed at NVFEL for this same purpose. Test vehicles are moved without starting or driving them by use of a RICO vehicle (crab) mover. The stackers system shall be designed to function and integrate with these vehicle movers in getting the vehicles on and off the stacker lift platforms. The contractor shall design, fabricate, deliver, install, and test the equipment to assure that it meets the functions specified and meets all the requirements herein.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Stacker System shall conform to the requirements specified in the procurement Scope of Work. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project - configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting compliance with any applicable building codes.<br />This procurement will be made using a trade-off analysis to determine the best value to the government. The applicable North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238290, "Vehicle Lift Installation." This procurement is being procured on a full and open competition basis. In addition to price, the Government's evaluation of proposals will address each offeror's project approach and experience and past performance. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price for purposes of source selection. The solicitation will be released through the internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Prospective offerors can download the Request for Proposals and related documents from this website currently. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

The Mobile Computing ARRA funded project is designing, building, and deploying a remote access system (currently called GO, Global OpenNet) for global use by Department employees and contractors. GO is architected 10 support 5,000 concurrent users. The GO infrastructure will reside in ESOC east and will leverage the IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure provides virtual servers to host customer systems, allowing the ESOC to consolidate customer systems from stand-alone servers into an efficient, highly available, centrally managed infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure also provides virtual servers used internally to host the ESOC infrastructure services (e.g. Active Directory. DHCP, backup, availability monitoring, configuration management). HP servers have long served as the ESOC core infrastructure. The purchase  to support the GO infrastructure is an extension of the existing infrastructure and is required to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer lights-out ESOCs.41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirement as a key component of the Department's IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. This purchase is an extension of the investment already made in this brand name. This is not a completely new installation but builds upon existing infrastructure. Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully. The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure, on a competitive basis, 574 Left and 574 Right Sparrow RIM-7 BSU-64/B Wing Assemblies, and 1,148 BSU-63/B Fin Assemblies in Containers. The Government intends to award a contract for the production of these components for the RIM-7 Sparrow Missile on a firm fixed-price basis. The RIM-7M Sparrow is a radar-guided (semi-active), air-to-air missile with a high explosive warhead. The missile system provides an all-weather, all altitude operational capability and can attack high performance aircraft and missiles from any direction. The missile utilizes an annular blast fragmentation warhead, a solid propellant rocket motor, Guidance Section, Control Section, and folding wings and clipped fins. The wing is approximately 16 inches high and the base of the wing is 17.7 inches long and consists of a high strength aluminum casting with both chemical conversion coating and film treatment. The wing also consists of wing tip ballast manufactured from tungsten alloy and a preloaded rod assembly. The fin is approximately 8.4 inches high and the base of the fin is 18.1 inches long and consists of aluminum alloy forging with chemical conversion coating. The folding wings and clipped fins are used to accommodate the dimensions of the launcher cell. The Wing and Fin Assembly requirements have tooling and test equipment costs that must be incurred by a company that does not have the specific equipment. A First Article Test requirement is mandatory for hardware not previously qualified by the Navy. The technical data package (TDP) for the Wing and Fin Assemblies and Container is UNCLASSIFIED. Offerors must request a copy of the TDP from the Sparrow Technical Office located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland by contacting Mrs. Sarah Littleton (301) 995-4973 or email Sarah.Littleton@navy.mil. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage on or about 31 May 2010 and will close approximately 30 days after issuance. The RFP will only be made available via the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select "Doing Business" And "Open Solicitations". All amendments will be posted at the same Internet website. Hard copies of the solicitation and amendments will not be mailed to contractors. After RFP release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure that they have all amendments. All responsible, small-business sources listed under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336419 may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. The Government will not accept electronic proposals. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: Registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as a Small Business under NAICS code 336419 will be a prerequisite for receiving an award. For more information on the CCR, refer to the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.

<DESC>Amendment 0003 is available for download.<BR><BR>The Ohio Riverfront Cincinnati, Ohio, Walnut Street Event Lawn project is located in Hamilton County, Ohio. The work for the second contract will take place on top of a recently constructed parking garage near the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. To the north and south, independent projects are being constructed in association with the Banks development including roadway improvements, multiuse development buildings with subsurface parking garages, and a realigned/reconstructed roadway. Immediately adjacent and to the west is the Phase I site. It is anticipated that Phase I will be awarded this month, May 2010. The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies.<BR><BR>Construction will take place on-structure, atop a parking garage designed to accommodate parking for special events, park and city visitors and those working at the many businesses throughout the downtown area. Site preparation for this contract will require installing a waterproofing system on the roof of the parking garage. The waterproofing will consist of applying a hot fluid over the concrete deck. The fluid is a rubberized asphalt system with protection board and root barriers. Associated with the work are concrete repairs, sealant joints, and 3 compression joints with cover plates. The waterproofing contractor will be responsible for deck preparation; furnishing and installing the system; and providing protection and repairs to the system during installation of the surface features. The contractor must be certified to install the system and provide a five year warranty. The main feature consists of the Event Lawn, which will provide a place for public gatherings both large and small. A granite paved walkway will be constructed along the west and south edges of the lawn. On the western edge, a stage and canopy will be constructed facing the lawn. The stage is a raised platform paved in granite with a shade structure above. Decorative lighting will be incorporated into the ceiling and also mounted to the canopy's columns. Speakers will be strategically placed at the canopy and at certain areas of the lawn in order to accommodate major festivals that require sound. The lawn rises one and a half feet from the west to the east. The grade change is contained by stone seatwalls to the north and south, the east and west ends are flush with surrounding grade. Within the lawn sit specimen shade trees, alternating with pedestrian post top lights, and punctuated by several sets of stone steps. <BR><BR>This is set-aside for Small Businesses. The proposals will be evaluated based on a best value source selection process. The selection process will evaluate such factors as: Prime Contractor Past Experience and Prime Contractor Past Performance, Price, and Pro Forma information. The estimated cost range for this project is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990, with a size standard of $33.5M. The base construction contract duration is approximately 300 days. The approximate issue date is 24 May 2010 and approximate closing date is 24 June 2010, 11:00 am Eastern Time. Downloading of the project documents requires registration at the FedBizOps (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Amendments will be available from the FedBizOps website by download only. Prior to submission of proposals all contractors must have an active registration in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) data base. To register or update information go to http://www.ccr.gov. Questions may be addressed to Stephanie Craig, Contract Specialist, via email Stephanie.M.Craig@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Recovery  This competitive action was awarded pursuant to the 2009 NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement entitled "ResearchOpportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009 under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment 7, B.6Verification and Validation of Flight Critical Systems and is funded by the AmericanReinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA).  This action is a fixed-price contract to KestrelTechnologies, LLC entitled A Safety Case Workbench.  The goal of the Verification andValidation of Flight-Critical Systems (VVFCS) project is to develop multidisciplinaryverification and validation tools and techniques that advance safety assurance andcertification of complex, networked, distributed flight critical systems. Flight criticalsystems are defined to be any system that directly controls the safe conduct of anaircrafts flight including air and ground systems, concepts of operation as well astechnology, and recognizes that human performance is a key factor in flight-criticalsystems and must be accounted for.  The increasing complexity of flight critical systemsproposed for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) will require newparadigms and real-time distributed system infrastructures providing high levels ofconfidence and safety assurances. The cost of proving a flight-critical system is safe isoften expected to far surpass the costs for other aspects of design and implementation.In this effort, the Contractor will develop a prototype of a safety case tool in the formof a workbench.  The workbench modules will capture specific elements of a safety case(arguments, claims, evidence  including probabilistic evidence); will supportinfrastructure tasks, such as the means to maintain historical data; and will supportsafety case planning and resource estimation.  Also, the Contractor will document aworkbench Application Program Interface (API) to facilitate data exchange between theworkbench modules and other tools.  At the conclusion of this effort the Contractor will have completed a prototype of thesafety case workbench, a prototype and at least one refinement of each module, and willhave documented the workbench API.  The contractor will also have demonstrated thecapabilities of the workbench across all modules through the use of a comprehensive unittest framework, and will have demonstrated the use of the API through an exampleinterface with at least one external analytical tool.The referenced solicitation is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 andNFS 1835.016. Additional information regarding the 2009 ROA solicitation can be found at&lt;AHREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method"&gt;http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method&lt;/A&gt; =init&solId={8AA62753-0F6B-3791-4A43-3DEF562FA257}&path=open (ROA-2009 CompleteSolicitation as of November 24, 2009). &lt;P&gt;This announcement this announcement is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) is procuring engineering and technical support services (ETSS) for programs within, and supported by, the Special Surveillance Programs Office (SSPO). The SSPO develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, Electro-Optical, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and persistent surveillance systems. The purpose of these sensors and surveillance systems is to support a variety of OCONUS Contingency Operations (OCO) missions for persistent surveillance. The SSPO is also responsible for rapid turn-around research, development, and prototyping to demonstrate advanced sensors/payloads for persistent surveillance.
<p>Engineering and technical support services are required to assist the SSPO in providing rapid, affordable, limited quantity procurement (LQP) of select Navy airborne and land-based systems. These systems include small and medium sized autonomous airborne surveillance systems such as Arrow, Aerosonde, Scan Eagle, Mako, Silver Fox, and TigerShark, as well as ground sensor systems such as the Remote Observation Post (ROP), Portable Cooled Infrared Kit (PCIRK), and P417. The objective of this procurement is to ensure engineering and technical support services are in place to support SSPO as they upgrade the capabilities of these multiple systems using emerging electronics, avionics, detection, and sensor technologies. Engineering and technical support services are also required to provide support for advanced ground control station (GCS) shelters efforts that support common communication platforms.</p>
<p>This procurement is issued&nbsp;as a sole-source 8(a) procurement under FAR part 19.8 and Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637(a)(1).&nbsp; This will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee effort.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>This document constitutes a justification and approval for the use of other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein. It is executed on behalf of the Department of the Air Force, Air Mobility Command, 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida 33621.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6CONS) intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed price construction contract to Clark-MacDill Builders, Inc. (Clark), 2 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite 250-Mezzanine Level, Bethesda, MD 20814, a large business, to design and install Bayshore Security Cameras in MacDill AFB's privatized housing area. The security cameras will serve command personnel from United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) living in the housing area under Clark Construction, Inc. at no cost to the Government as part of their 50-year housing privatization lease agreement with the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p>Funding will be through the use of Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funds. O&amp;M funds are the correct funds for this project as detailed in the 28 March 2008 HQ AF/A7C memorandum. Maj Gen Eulber's memorandum directed the use of O&amp;M funds in lieu of Military Family Housing (MFH) funds in government controlled and privatized housing to fund upgraded and secure requirements.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The requiring activity is the 6th Civil Engineer Squadron, MacDill AFB, FL. The anticipated contract will provide a USCENTCOM with a "turn-key" solution that includes design, engineering, furnish, fabricate, install, test and maintain new security camera system with integration into the Security Forces Squadron Control Center. The requirement includes at a minimum four (4) each pan-tilt-zoom cameras; system shall include an incident reporting system, lightning protection.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting acquisition of this requirement by other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>&nbsp;V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The Clark-MacDill Design Builder was awarded a lease of 227 acres of land for a term of 50 years to demolish the existing, build new, manage and maintain military housing on MacDill AFB. As part of this lease, Clark is demolishing 507 homes and building 331 new homes, including 27 GO and 26 SO homes as cited above.</p>
<p>The MFH privatization contract allows the government unrestricted right of way in the housing compound without further consideration to Clark. Coordination with Clark before commencement and prosecution of any work, however, is required by the contract. Pursuant to terms of the lease, the government would have to provide a written request for a right of ways to allow another contractor to install the security cameras and Clark has the right to present matters that adversely affect their lease interest. The installation of new infrastructure while Clark is simultaneously performing work in the MFH area would almost certainly interfere with their use of, or access to, the project area in violation of the lease agreement.</p>
<p>The right of way issue is difficult, but an even bigger obstacle is the fact that Clark (as the architect/engineer and construction contractor for the housing units) owns the proprietary data rights for the design/engineering drawings and specifications for the new homes being built. The government does not hold title to the data. Having these proprietary drawings/data is essential to ensure the work does not conflict with any other work, the new infrastructure is properly located, and the connections in the MFH housing units are correct. An outside contractor would be working from a "blank sheet of paper" and would have no idea where the utilities and infrastructure have been or will be installed without Clark's proprietary data. In other words, an outside contractor must have these drawings/data to perform the work.</p>
<p>This raises the question as to whether Clark would be willing to sell the drawings/data to the government and if it would be cost effective for the government to purchase them from Clark. Clark might be willing to sell to the government, but we have every reason to believe that the cost of the data would exceed the estimated $140K cost to install the security cameras. There is no incentive for Clark to give the government a discount. The cost of the proprietary data would not be recovered through competition. Further, the camera requirement is considered a onetime project, i.e., MacDill does not anticipate future, similar projects within the Military Family Housing area that would require use of the drawings/data.</p>
<p>Given the unique nature of this acquisition as described above, Clark is the only source who can reasonably install the security cameras within the required schedule with no repercussions involving the lease and at the same time allow the government to avoid extreme duplication of costs not recoverable through competition of this one-time requirement.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.</p>
<p>Clark was awarded a 50-year lease of housing area on MacDill AFB after a full and open competition in which four companies submitted/presented proposals to a source selection board. The AF Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) was contacted to see if it was possible to either modify Clark's existing lease to add the security camera work or to use one of the AFCEE's multiple award construction requirements IDIQ contracts to accomplish the work. The following are the results of those discussions with AFCEE.</p>
<p>According to the housing privatization portfolio manager, Mr. Mark Wall, modifying the current agreement is not possible. First, modifying the lease requires Air Staff and OMB approval, and secondly, the lease is not a FAR based contract and their legal has determined that it is inappropriate to add appropriated funds to the agreement. Mr. Wall's email to the 6CONS/DBO stated: "Funds cannot be transferred or given to "The Project" to complete this work. This is a Real Estate Transaction, and even though there is an LLC aspect to the project between Clark and Air Force, there is no FAR mechanism to obligate/expense the funds. The project cannot assume this work and seek compensation later, nor trade scope to offset the costs".</p>
<p>The AFCEE Heavy Engineering Repair and Construction (HERC) multiple award contracts were determined not to be a viable alternative because Clark is not one of the prime contract holders under the requirements contracts, nor are they a partner with any of the HERC contract holders. Since the AFCEE contracts are "Requirements" contracts, pursuant to FAR 52.216-21 the Government (AFCEE) shall order from the contractor all the supplies or services specified in the schedule that are required purchased by the Government activity or activities specified in the schedule.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon use of cost/price analysis and engineering technical evaluation. The basis for this determination will be from an independent government cost estimate using the R.S. Means Construction estimating guide. The estimate will be reviewed by the government's contracted engineering services contractor, Chugach Management Services, Inc. (CMSI), and a government professional engineer and the functional area chief. Technical advice may also be provided by CMSI. The contracting officer will rely on the government engineering estimate, the contractor's detailed cost breakdown, and comprehensive negotiations to ensure that final contract price will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>MacDill's construction requirements are typically done by its CE contractor. However, MFH construction was specifically excluded from their contract because new MFH construction is typically a MILCON project contracted through AFCEE or the Army Corps of Engineers. Further, MFH maintenance was deleted from their contract in 2008 when the housing privatization agreement was reached with Clark. MacDill does not anticipate future similar requirements in the MFH area. However, projects outside of the MFH compound will be accomplished and competed with the multiple award construction contract holders.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. A LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>None. This is one-time contract for separate infrastructure of security cameras.</p>
<p>XII. TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE CERTIFICATION. <br />The technical representative's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document is evidence that he/she has determined that the technical justification provided is complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(b).)</p>
<p>XIII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION.</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document is evidence that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12).)</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

VISN 18 Contracting Office
6950 E Williams Field Rd
Mesa, AZ 85212

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 18 Contracting Office.

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a cable television service for the Amarillo VA Health Care System in Amarillo, Texas.  The intent is to procure this service from Cequel Communications LLC, DBA Suddenlink.

3.	 Description of Supplies or Services:  The Amarillo VA Health Care System in Amarillo, Texas is seeking to award an Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract to provide cable television service, equipment, and labor for the facility.  The vendor is to provide all materials, supervision, personnel, equipment, and tools necessary to provide cable television service to the designated locations in the facility.

4.	 Statutory Authority:  In accordance with FAR 6.302 Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition the following statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source contract to Cequel Communications LLC, DBA Suddenlink.
Far 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency
(a)	Authority.
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2)
The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when  the agencys need for the property or services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.	

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:     Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) and FAR 6.302-2, contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) when an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justifications and approvals described in FAR 6.303 and 6.304.  Authorized or required by statute. Synopsis is not required per FAR 5.202(a)(2).  This authority is being used because a Bulk Services and Access Agreement was signed by the previous CFO of the Amarillo VA Health Care System on January 25th, 2008 commiting the Government to use the services provided by Cequel Communications LLC, DBA Suddenlink through January 31st, 2013.  In order to terminate this agreement without incurring monetary penalties, a new contract expiring on the same date will need to be issued  

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Upon expiration of the sole source contract, the Government intends to issue a solicitation for the required service using Full and Open Competition.  The Contracting Officer has validated that the contractor is registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the vendor is responsible by following the guidance found in Department of Veterans Affairs Information Letter (IL) 049-08-03 dated April 11, 2008.  Pursuant to this guidance the Contracting Officer verified that Cequel Communications LLC, DBA Suddenlink has an acceptable Supplier Risk Score as verified by Dun & Bradstreet.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $145,611.00 based on the Independent Government Estimate.  Negotiations will be entered into with vendor to ensure that the final proposed price is fair and reasonable based upon this IGE.    

8.	Other Considerations:  A review of the Bulk Services and Access Agreement mentioned in section 5 was completed by Regional Counsel, and it was determined that if the Government were to terminate the service and issue a new solicitation using Full and Open Competition, Cequel Communications LLC, DBA Suddenlink would have a significant possibility of collecting monetary damages from the Government.  The opinion provided by Regional Counsel was that the best course of action is to terminate the Bulk Services and Access Agreement and concurrently award a contract to the vendor that terminates January 31st, 2013.  The vendor is amenable to this option.   

9.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A.

10.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  Individuals at the Amarillo VA Health Care System have been advised not to sign service agreements, and that procurements of this nature need to be completing through following proper contracting procedures.  A solicitation will be issued using Full and Open Competition following the period of performance of the sole source contract.

11.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

12.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 


a.	Contracting Officer's Certification: (required)  I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This award is a continuation of the development and integration services supporting the TC-AIMS II commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supply chain solutions developed by Apptricity.  The specialized vendor patent software developed by Apptricity is a major component of the Transportation Information System (TIS).  Apptricity's COTS software offers the ability to operate within any hardware/software configuration, regardless of operating system, data source, application server or web server.  Leveraging the clustering, pooling, and load balancing technologies, Apptricity's COTS software offers the ability to support several hundred to several thousand sim  ultaneous users and offers integrated  configuration and customization capabilities to dynamically change the functionality of its solutions, including page configuration, reference data, workflow and process rules based on customer specific requirements.  Apptricity's COTS software also offers an Integration Engine to enable real-time and batch interfaces to internal and external systems. The Integration Engine accommodates object relational mapping and standard interfaces with XML, EDI, delimited and fixed format data.  Apptricity Corporation has supported the PEO TIS program for the past 5 years in its development of an Interface Engine which wraps legacy formats (CSV, XML, X12, fixed) with an XML layer to standardize interfaces.  Since November, 2004, Apptricity's proprietary software has become the baseline for continued TIS development and customization.  Maintaining continued support and operation for the system is critical to the overall DoD and Joint Services mission.
