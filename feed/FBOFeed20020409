<RESPDATE>042302
<ARCHDATE>05232002
<CONTACT>Susan Benik, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1350
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends 	to competitively award a contract to gather and synthesize information about 	explosive removals of offshore structures. Within one year of lease 	termination, the MMS requires that oil and gas structures be removed from 	the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and that structures be severed at least 15 	feet below the seafloor.  Explosives are typically used to sever structures 	below the mudline.  As a federal agency, the MMS is required to ensure that 	the oil and gas activities it regulates comply with regulations stemming 	from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Marine Mammal 	Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Outer 	Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).  Consequently, the MMS requires the 	best available information regarding the environmental impacts of underwater 	demolitions, the different technologies used for explosive structure 	removals, and the probable environmental impacts from these methodologies. 	As a first step, a comprehensive search and integration of existing 	technical information is needed.  This information search and synthesis is 	proposed to develop a rational basis for management decisions to minimize 	the potential taking of protected species while permitting the explosive 	removal of offshore structures.  The purpose of the investigation is to 	collect and synthesize historical and new information on explosive removals 	of offshore structures in aquatic environments.  The study objectives are: 	(1) provide a summary of available information by topic, (2) identify 	information and data gaps that could be filled by subsequent research 	activities, and (3) prioritize MMS information needs.  The performance 	period of this contract shall be twelve (12) months.  Cost of this study is 	estimated to be between $200,000 to $250,000.  This study consists of two 	main tasks: (1) collecting information and data concerning explosive 	removals of offshore structure and; (2) generating a synthesis report that 	characterizes the scope and depth of the information available.  HOW TO 	RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST 	demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, by 	4:00 P.M. EST, April 23, 2002, a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your 	key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing 	and/or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific expertise 	and experience; (2) your organization's experience with this type of work; 	and (3) specific references (including contract number and project 	description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification 	with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this 	nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last 	four years.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original 	and two hard copies to Susan Benik, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management 	Service, 381 Elden Street, (MS 2510), Herndon, Virginia 20170-4817. In 	addition an electronic version shall be sent to Susan.Benik@mms.gov. Eight 	(8) additional hard copies shall be submitted to Connie Landry, Procurement 	Coordinator, Minerals Management Service, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, (MS 	5431), New Orleans, LA 70123-2394.  Time of receipt of submissions will be 	determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, 	Herndon, Virginia. Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: 	(1) your key personnel skills, abilities and experience; and (2) your 	organization's experience and past performance (including number, size, and 	complexity of similar projects, adherence to schedules and budgets, 	effectiveness of program management, general compliance with the terms of 	the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.  Following review of 	all Capabilities Statements, we will establish a list of those seemed most 	qualified to perform the work. Qualified offerors will be notified and 	provided additional proposal instructions. Proposals will essentially 	consist of a written proposal, written program management plan, and written 	business (cost) proposal. Further details of proposal requirements and 	logistical considerations will be provided at a later date. The period of 	performance of the contract will be from date of award through 12 months. 	Questions should be faxed or emailed as soon as possible to: Fax (703) 	787-1009 or e-mail at susan.benik@mms.gov. With your questions, please 	include your full name, the RFP number & title, your organization, complete 	address, and phone and fax numbers.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), AZ intends to negotiate and award a contract to GEOViz.com, 6528 Greenleaf Avenue, Suite 200, Whittier, CA 90601 on an other than full and open competition basis.  In CY2000 YPG was tasked to develop a real-time 3D geospatial web development and visualization system that would provide the ability to collect, analyze and disseminate geospatial and earth science information of the desert, tropic and arctic environments.  The product used for the ongoing technology d emonstrator is GeoViz, which is a client/server software development, and collaborative environment that allows the blending of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and dynamic 3D Collaboration and Visualization. Utilizing the Internet/Intranet Browser a s a development environment and via the use of an extensible and open API, GeoViz E-Server provided extensive support for the integration and visualization of a variety of data formats and types including GIS, textual, 2D/3D/4D, imagery, digital terrain mo dels, vector, CAD, raster, temporal, environmental, track and sensor data. The resulting geospatial content was then collaborated and visualized in real-time and interacted with in 3D via standard web based documents without the need for recurring runtime or execution fees. An interface was developed to YPG’s Quantitative Visualization (QV) Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) project. That COTS interface to QV supports the following: a.	Peer-to-peer live component/sensor data collaboration b.	Online processing of multi-resolution multi-tiered spatial databases c.	Mapster support of spatial data layer representation d.	Instant messaging of newly archived test data e.	Automatic email notification to collaborators of XML based geospatial layers  f.	Launch of QV from the GeoViz Spatial Desktop g.	Advanced Multi Resolution Compression algorithms h.	Integration/comparison of synthetic environments and live video i.	Integration with Microsoft Office 2000  YPG is currently tasked and has the lead under VPG, Integrated Information Systems (IIS) Joint Database Integration project to investigate the requirements, methods and processes for linking external repositories and integrating VPG visualization tools wit h Integrated Level Hierarchy using the GeoViz software components. This is an integration/coordination effort with the other DTC test centers and the deliverable will be a web-based distribution and collaboration system.   GeoViz is the only COTS and GOTS tool that provides web-centric GeoSpatial Collaboration.  Interested parties may submit technical literature showing their capability of meeting the Government's requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for comp etitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Alternate POC for this action is Ms. Pamela Nevels who may be contacted via e-mail at Pamela.Nevels@yuma.army.mil

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations for comparison with data acquired during a ship-rotorcraft aerodynamic interaction test in a NASA Ames Wind Tunnel. An additional requirement will be to provide training to NASA personnel in the latest version of ROT3DC analysis code for analysis of the configuration tested in the Wind Tunnel. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Sukra Helitek Inc., of Ames, Iowa, under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1), based on its unique capabilities to provide viscous flow field calculations of complex geometries, such as multiple rotorcraft operating in close proximity, within the urgent time frame required by NASA Ames.  Because of reporting requirements to another governmental agency, delivery of the required grids, calculated results, assumptions in calculations, and on-site tutorial are due 45 days after award.  In addition, because Sukra Helitek has previously built grid geometries for the various vehicles being tested, it is expected that minimal modifications to the grids will be required to model the current configurations, thereby saving significant time and expense by not having to construct the grids from scratch.  Since Sukra Helitek is the developer of the ROT3DC code, it is expected that they can effectively provide the required training to NASA Ames personnel.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on April 23, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>052402
<ARCHDATE>04092003
<CONTACT>Jagdeep Shah, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Optical Code Division Multiple Access (O-CDMA) technology and systems.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  1. Enabling Hardware Technology for optical encoding and decoding, including novel detection schemes and detector optimization, 2. Coding Algorithms, including multidimensional and coherent codes that optimize O-CDMA networks, and 3. O-CDMA Network Architecture, Network Simulations and Applications.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 02-18 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The O-CDMA program will consist of a 15 month Phase I effort followed by an optional Phase II (21 months) and Phase III (12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards totaling approximately $15 million for Phase I are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2003.  Options totaling approximately $30 million may be awarded for Phase II and Phase III efforts.  Organizations wishing to participate in the Phase II and Phase III efforts should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  A website- https://www.davincinetbook.com/ocdma has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Interested parties may post on the web site the points of contact (POC), their address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail information and any non-proprietary information about their areas of expertise and interest that may help in forming the teams.  Specific information content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibilities of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination website or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This website is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts as well.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Jagdeep Shah, phone: (703) 696-2253, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: jshah@darpa.mil. GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 02-18, Optical Code Division Multiple Access, Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on the objectives of O-CDMA BAA, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, the World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original hardcopy of the proposal, 5 hardcopies and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-18, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2. The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-18) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, May 24, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-18 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in O-CDMA.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 02-18.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals, which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  The administrative addresses for this BAA are:  Fax:  (703) 696-2206 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 02-18), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-18@darpa.mil, Mail: DARPA/MTO, ATTN: BAA 02-18, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  This announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area.

<DESC>17. 	The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB FL, intends to award a sole source task order using the GSA IT Schedule to Decision Sciences Incorporated, 2112 Lewis Turner Blvd., Ft. Walton Beach, FL, 32547, (850) 864-2552 for continuation of the design, development, and implementation of a web-based enterprise solution, titled the "Warrior Support Tool" developed by Decision Sciences Incorporated.  The "Warrior Support Tool" allows decision makers at AAC to better manage the process of developing, acquiring and sustaining key weapon systems for the war fighter.  The requirements of AAC are such that new functions must be added and integrated with existing functions thus resulting in the modification and development of new software constructs that will be incorporated within the existing system.  The purpose of this effort is to improve the accuracy and estimates of current inventory, future needs, and the ability of the industrial base to provide critical war ready munitions.  The period of performance will be the base year, plus four option years as a firm-fixed price contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541511 ($18 million).  If you feel you can provide this service, please provide your qualifications and experience in this particular area and identify whether you are a large or small business based on this NAICS Code.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) plans to solicit proposals from one or more commercial laboratories to test ground beef for microbial levels and fat content.  During a one year period there will be approximately 4,000 lots of ground beef tested for fat content.  Four individual sample units will be tested from each lot for a total of approximately 16,000 ground beef samples for fat content testing.  Contractor(s) will also test separate samples of ground beef for standard plate counts, total coliforms, generic E. coli, and and coagulase positive Staphlococci levels, and for the presence of Salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7.  USDA estimates that during a one year period there may be 2,000 samples of ground beef for microbial testing for a total of approximately 12,000 individual bacteria tests.  The contractor(s) will provide results (including lot fat content average, median and range) to AMS and to individual USDA ground beef contractors.  Limited quantities of other commodities (e.g., ground pork and ground bison) may also be added for testing.

USDA may also include a requirement for microbial testing for boneless beef in the solicitation.  If included, it would require the testing of boneless beef for standard plate counts, total coliforms, generic E. coli and Salmonella.  Selected contractor(s) would analyze results from each meat supplier and provide control charts and capability reports to AMS, to boneless beef suppliers and to individual USDA ground beef contractors.  At full implementation, USDA estimates that during a one year period there may be 4,000 samples of boneless beef for microbial testing.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  South Africa Tire Recycling Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to determine the technical, economic and financial viability of a tire recycling project.

The proposed project relates to recycling 2 to 3 million used tires per year at three different locations in South Africa.  The plants will be located near major metropolitan areas in South Africa -- Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Durban.  All three areas have tire dumps and are major contributors to used tire disposal each year.  According to a 1998 survey, there are over 27 million tire carcasses stockpiled in various dumps in South Africa.  In addition to existing dumps, it is estimated that based on the number of motor vehicles on the road, twelve million tire carcasses are discarded each year and will be available for recycling.   

Firms active in the South African tire market are eager to make use of cheap and readily available discarded tires in order to reduce their own manufacturing costs and to exploit new product areas.  RBSDI is a non-profit entity established by the South African government to promote economic growth, mainly by identifying equity partners to invest in local projects.  RBSDI has been working individually with MaxiPrest, Michelin SA, and Trentyre as potential equity investors in this project.  Recently, these three tire sector companies formed SATRP for the purposes of jointly developing this mutually beneficial project. 

The major tasks that comprise the terms of reference for the feasibility study are as follows:

Part I--Recycling Environment
1.	Review of existing scrap tire management systems in South Africa
2.	Analysis of recovery technologies, shredding, grinding/crumbing, pyrolysis
3.	Survey of the markets for recovered tire products
4.	Analysis of the project's economics
5.	Development of specifications for the tire recycling facilities

Part II--Project specifications
6.	Facility siting
7.	Operational plan
8.	Refined economic analysis
9.	Financial plan
10.	 Regulatory Environment (including environmental)
11.	 Suppliers analysis
12.	 Project implementation strategy
13.	 Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $274,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., May 14, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The following is a reissue to correct typo error that occurred during electronic transmission:

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) SEFC for the development of the Southeast Federal Center (SEFC) in Washington, D.C.  The 44-acre site is located in the District of Columbia Near Southeast neighborhood, along the banks of the Anacostia River, within one mile of the United States Capitol. Under the enactment of the Southeast Federal Center Public-Private Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-407), GSA has special authority to adopt innovative, flexible approaches for working with the private sector in developing the SEFC site.  Such approaches may include leases, contracts, joint ventures, acquisitions, and/or other types of arrangements. GSA's primary goal is to enhance the value of SEFC to the United States. Achieving this goal will require that the site be developed to its fullest potential, drawing upon the ideas, capabilities, and experience of the private sector. GSA envisions an urban mixed-use waterfront development to include office, residential, retail, and a waterfront park.  This RFQ stage is the first stage in a two-stage selection process.  The objective of this RFQ stage is to identify the most highly qualified developers to continue in the selection process.  The RFQ will be followed by the issuance of one or more Requests for Proposals ("RFP Stage") to the most highly qualified developers identified from the RFQ stage.  Comprehensive and detailed development proposals will be solicited in the RFP stage of the selection process.  At the conclusion of the final step, GSA will select the preferred developer(s) with whom to enter into agreement(s) for the lease, sale, or other agreements regarding the development of the site(s), based on criteria outlined in the RFP.  The RFQ may be downloaded from the website: http://www.gsa.gov/southeastfederal center, or from http//:www.fedbizopps.gov.  Qualified developers are invited to respond to the RFQ by July 01, 2002.  There will be no bidders' list for this procurement and no hard copies will be provided.  Direct all questions to Nydia Coleman at 202-260-4462 or fax 202-401-0076 or e-mail nydia.coleman@gsa.gov.

<DESC>1.  Case Tracking System Requirement:  Maintenance and enhancement of this system requires knowledge and experience in Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook programming, including creating/modifying custom Outlook forms and VBScript and VBA programming. It also requires J2EE knowledge and experience, specifically with Java servlets, JSPs, and Javabeans. It also requires knowledge and experience in Oracle database design and maintenance.  The following tasks have been identified:  a.  Assist IT Service In Implementing Case Tracking System Help Desk:  Prepare email for FSA-wide mailing similar to the Computer Ordering module email introducing the process to FSA. Prepare user documentation for the CIO personnel who will service the requests; b.  Case Tracking System Help Desk:  The following enhancements are required for the general questions and inquiries function, referred to as the "help desk:"  
1)  Provide an administration console so that an administrator can add/change functions, employees, and assign employees to different functions;
2)  Provide a reporting capability at the manager, Deputy CIO, and CIO levels, showing how effective the staff has been in providing support; c.  Revise Case Tracking System Computer Equipment Ordering:  The procedures for ordering and receiving computer equipment will soon change. The orders will be routed directly from OCIO/IT Services to the Department for procurement on the Department's BPA, and go through a different route than is currently the case. The system will need to be modified to accommodate this change; d.  Develop Remaining Functions of the Case Tracking System:  The most important component of the Case Tracking System, ordering computer equipment and supplies, has been completed and implemented. Recently, a component to track general questions and issues was added. The following planned components still must be created:
 
1) Equipment relocations and moves
2) Email additions and changes 
3) Ordering blackberries and pagers
4) VDC resources
5) Data and voice communications
6) Telephone/voicemail additions and changes; e.  Document The Case Tracking System:

Provide technical documentation for all components of the Case Tracking System. This includes the overall system, the database, and each program component.

2.  The Citrix Website:  The Citrix web site consists of an IIS server with custom, proprietary ASP code supplied by Citrix. The Citrx code has been modified to provide capabilities not provided by Citrix, such as the ability for users to change passwords. Additional capabilities may be required in the future, and modifications to existing capabilities may be needed.

	Task 2a.:  Provide support for the Citrix website on an as-needed basis.

3.  The Extranet Website:  Requires knowledge and experience as an iPlanet system administrator.

Task 3a.:  Maintain the Extranet and its three subordinate virtual sites, the EID site, the intern web site, and the externally-accessible portion of SFANet, resolving issues such as protecting certain sections of the site from public view, maintaining effective throughput, and resolving issues with access and passwords.  
Task 3b.:  Implement automatic deployment to all webservers on this site using the standard Teamsite tool. 

Provide Technical Web Support As Required:  Provide technical consulting to the IT Services staff on web questions in general. 

Evaluation Criteria:

1.	(40%)  Demonstrated knowledge and experience with the following tool sets and databases, which are used in the Federal Student Aid (FSA) enterprise:  Interwoven, Autonomy, and Oracle.
2.	(40%)  Proven experience developing web applications to the J2EE standard.
3.	(10%)  Knowledge of the content standards used by Federal Student Loan web sites and the Department of Education common www.ed.gov web site.
4.	(10%)  Familiarity with (FSA) organization and web requirements.

For this solicitation, price will be a substantial factor in source selection; however, technical merit is significantly more important than cost or price.  The contracting officer will determine whether the difference in quality is worth the difference in price.

Interested parties should submit their proposals by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, April 10, 2002; to Roscoe H. Price, III, Contracting Officer, U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid, Union Center Plaza, 830 First Street, NE, Room 101H4, Washington, DC  20202-5405.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of a universal aircraft jack, jack tester and jack control unit for planning purposes.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an Initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of a Mobile Aircraft Jack and Equipment Kit (MAJEK).  This system should operate as a deployable aircraft jacking system capable of supporting on-equipment maintenance and testing of landing gear and doors on heavier military airlifters, refuelers and bombers (C-130, C-17, C-5, KC-135, KC-10, E-3, E-8, B-1, B-2, B-52, 747, 767) The AEFB has determined that two universal aircraft jacks, based on size and weight of aircraft, capable of quick and easy breakdown and build-up is achievable and could offer an advantage in deployment preparation and execution.  Given that capability, a substantial reduction in mobility footprint can be achieved while increasing maintenance support of aircraft jacking operations in the deployed location.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.
The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce and certify an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this Initiative includes demonstrating a system to jack the aforementioned aircraft to a height capable of operating the landing gear and doors.  Also, test the load of the jacks with a deployable tester and operate the jacks via a pressurized air source control unit that actuates a hydraulic ram (either single or multi-stage) within the jack.  This control source should be capable of single or multiple jack operation.  This should include a manually operated back up in case of air system failure.  Characteristics of the jack must meet the requirements and restrictions of all the aforementioned aircraft. (Estimated 60-ton capacity, 52? roll under height, 200? total extended height with use of leg extensions and 100-ton capacity, 100? roll under height, 223? total extended height).  The weight and dimensions of these jacks when prepared for deployment should allow four of them, along with the tester and control unit to fit within the constraints of a minimum of one or maximum of two 463L standard military cargo pallets. Usable dimensions of one 463L pallet are Length 84? X Width 104? X Height 96? with a 10,000 lbs load capacity.
Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN 25 APRIL 2002 to TSgt Ronald Newpher, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  TSgt Newpher can be reached at (208) 828-3522.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The IRS is in the process of analyzing the capabilities within the market place to provide mail services from an off-site location(s) to support 24 IRS sites located within the Washington DC-metropolitan area and currently supports an average mail volume of 10,719 incoming pieces of mail and 11,762 outgoing pieces of mail per day. The IRS has mandated the mail program to reduce the potential risks of corrupted mail by relocating the services to a contractor off-site and is standardizing mail delivery requirements for these sites.  The mailroom customers are all employees of the agency, which comprises approximately 9,000 customers.  The majority of the sites (20) would require daily support (e.g., a minimum of two delivery/ pick-up per day), while the remaining 4 sites require varying degrees of support that range from every other day to weekly service.   The IRS is interested in those contractors that have existing facilities or have experience in standing-up a facility(s) capable of performing all of the following functions:  

1.  Receive US Postal Service, ground, priority, United Parcel Service, FedEx and courier service delivery; 
2.  Conduct security screening of all incoming deliveries, including but not limited to x-ray scan, canine inspection, and hazardous material/ biological contaminant screening, and screened items so that this screening is not compromised between the contractor facility and delivery to the federal agency?s locations; 
3.  Open all incoming mail to ensure no hazard present within contents (does not require review of mail contents to determine delivery direction)
4.  Sort the incoming, opened mail for delivery to designated locations; 
5.  Work with agency?s existing customer resource center to address customer questions and problems with mail-related issues; 
6.  Research correct routing for any misdirected mail; 
7.  Deliver and pick-up mail items to and from designated location with approximately two to three deliveries per location each day.  These pick-up and delivery services include entering each building and collecting mail from designated drop-off locations within the building, as well as delivery of mail to designated mailboxes; 
8.  Provide one dedicated and bonded staff member during business hours (9am-5pm) that can conduct special messenger services for the agency, consisting of courier inter-agency priority mail between the agency?s offices within the contracted sites, collection of specialty pick-up services, such as collecting passports/visas at various embassies and consulates; and 
9.  Provide pick up to 8 Post Office Boxes within three post offices in the Washington DC area.

The contractor?s facility shall be secure, and the agency?s mail isolated and processed so that it is not commingled with any other mail which the contractor may service.  Secured vehicles for delivery and pick-up services are necessary to ensure that security of items is not compromised during transportation.  

The agency may be able to furnish the contractor with some mailroom equipment from its current facility (e.g., postage meters, scales, etc.).  The agency intends to provide the necessary equipment, including any hardware or software, to allow for integration with the necessary databases to conduct these services, such as an employee location database for routing misdirected mail, as well as the employee resource center to handle questions and issues directly from the agency?s customers.  The agency may provide the contractor with mail carts and other items necessary to conduct delivery/ pick-up services at designated locations.  Through this RFI, IRS seeks interested, experienced parties to furnish capabilities statements with information illustrating the existence and experience in these services.  In addition, response to this notice must include contractor's size status.  NAICS is 491110 and small business size standard for this code is $6M.

IRS will use the information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the feasibility of a contractor-owned and operated mailroom facility.  Based on that assessment, IRS will decide whether to issue a solicitation for the services. This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to this RFI will not be considered as proposals or offers which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Address responses to the point of contact listed below or submit your response electronically to donna.l.Andersen@irs.gov.  All final written responses to this RFI should be received by 4:00 pm on April 24, 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract for the Service Life Assessment Program for the E-6B aircraft.  The E-6 aircraft is a derivative of the Boeing 707 commercial airliner.  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing is the only designer and manufacturer of the 707 airframe and owns the historical design data, drawings, design principles/concepts, and structural strength relationships.  Boeing also owns the data from previous commercial and military derivative 707 teardowns, component strength and fatigue tests, service life extensions, and general service life experience.  Boeing has indicated that they will not share this intellectual property at any cost.  Therefore, the Government has determined that Boeing is the only firm, which possesses the necessary knowledge, experience, and technical data to provide and perform the required efforts in an efficient and reliable manner.  However, NAVAIR is still seeking all interested sources to provide verifiable capabilities and information about existing SLAP expertise and experience.  SLAP program generated data and analyses are necessary to support competition of a follow-on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to develop and implement specific service life extensions modifications into the E-6B aircraft following completion of the SLAP program.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested sources are requested to submit a Capabilities Statement demonstrating existing expertise and experience in relation to meeting the below Navy requirements set forth below: 
a. Define the operational usage and loads;
b. Develop life-critical location candidate selection criteria;
c. Select life-critical locations on the aircraft primary structure;
d. Determine the load-to-strain/stress relationships for each critical location;
e. Generate a service spectra and calculate critical location fatigue lives that 90 percent of the fleet should exceed;
f. Perform damage tolerance analysis to determine critical location inspection techniques and intervals;
g. Evaluate life enhancement potential for life-critical locations; 
h. Modify the fatigue damage algorithms to accept available individual aircraft data to calculate individual aircraft fatigue life expended (FLE) values for all critical locations;
i. Baseline individual aircraft FLE values;
j. Develop damage tolerance algorithms to accept available individual aircraft data to calculate individual aircraft crack size (growth) values for all critical locations.

The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought are requested to be five to ten (5-10) pages long, and are limited to ten (10) pages with no prescribed format.  The Capabilities Statements shall demonstrate the ability to complete the required work in a cost effective manner and in view of the unavailability of Boeing proprietary data.  The Capabilities Statements are due by close of business on Monday 22 April 2002 and should be submitted electronically to the following e-mail addresses:  faubionsm@navair.navy.mil and to arwoodgj@navair.navy.mil.  This sources sought synopsis contains the most current available information and is subject to change at any time.  Notification of any changes shall be made only on the Internet as a modification to this synopsis.  The subject contract will cover a three-year period.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated needed herein is TBD ? ?TBD?.  When calling, be prepared to state name, address, and solicitation number. See note 9.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: NAVAIR intends to use Non-Government personnel in support of this effort.  Non-Government personnel may have the need to access industry data in order to support the Government.  Therefore, before an award, it may be necessary for the solicited company to enter into non-disclosure agreements with these individual?s companies.  Once NAVAIR finalizes its requirements for the subject effort, a prerequisite for receiving a contract award will be registration in the DODs Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  For more information on the CCR, contact the CCR Assistance Center at 1-888-227-2423.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above.

We are interested in receiving white papers on compact and rugged antenna technologies for real-time fuze status transmissions during underground target penetration.  Of particular interest are preliminary designs of compact 3-D and 2-D fractal antennas in realizable, integrable geometries such as cones, hemispheres and cylinders.  These would function somewhere in the frequency regime of 50-500MHz.  Also of interest are designs of very compact RF oscillators and transmitters in excess of 100 watts.  All of these components would require operation in harsh environments to include intense shock loads.  The technical point of contact for this RFI is:  Dr. Alex Cash, 850-882-0397/0391, cash@eglin.af.mil; AFRL/MNMI, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB, FL  32542-6810.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization will host an industry day for the VA's upcoming Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) acquisition.  All small and large businesses interested in this acquisition are encouraged to attend this important event. The VISTA Industry Day will be held on Tuesday, April 30, 2002, beginning at 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time, at the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association Building, 4400 Fair Oaks Court, Fairfax, VA 22033-3899.  The Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) will host this event for VA. It is the intent of the VISTA Industry Day to bring both small and large businesses together to hear from the Contracting Officer and Senior Program Officials about the VISTA acquisition, including tentative milestones for this acquisition as well as providing firms in attendance with an opportunity for interactive discussions with program officials and to network and explore teaming and subcontracting arrangements with other potential vendors. The VISTA Acquisition will be issued as two separate solicitations.  The first solicitation will cover all requirements, excluding the imaging requirements, and will be issued using full and open competition.  Imaging requirements will be issued as under a separate solicitation as a total small business set-aside. VA's Chief Information Office introduced VISTA in 1996.  It is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities. VISTA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff.  VISTA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies. The Decision Support System (DSS) and other national databases that might be derived from locally generated data lie outside the scope of VISTA. When development began on the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) in the early 1980s, information systems were in their infancy in VA medical facilities and emphasized primarily hospital-based activities. DHCP grew rapidly and is used by many private and public health care facilities throughout the United States and the world. Although DHCP represented the total automation activity at most VA medical centers in 1985, DHCP is now only one part of the overall information resources at the local facility level.  VISTA incorporates all of the benefits of DHCP as well as including the rich array of other information resources that are becoming vital to the day-to-day operations at VA medical facilities. It represents the culmination of DHCP's evolution and metamorphosis into a new, open system, client-server based environment that takes full advantage of commercial solutions, including those provided by Internet technologies. More information can be obtained on VISTA at the following URL address:  www.va.gov/vista_monograph. Directions to AFCEA can be obtained by calling 703-631-6100.  The VISTA Industry Day will be held in AFCEA Auditorium, and participants are requested to enter the Auditorium from the entrance on the side of the building.  Parking is available at no charge. Participation is limited to three individuals per firm.  To register for the VISTA Industry Day, please contact Mr. Ramsey Alexander, Jr., or Ms. Ilene Waggoner, Senior Procurement Analysts, telephone 202-565-8133 or 202-565-8127, respectively, or toll-free from outside the Washington Metropolitan Calling Area, at 1-800-949-8387.

<SUBJECT>--SUBJECT:  High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE) Type I (heavy)
<DESC>NA DESC: The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) is seeking sources of supply to produce and field the Army's Type I (heavy) High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE).  (See explanation of the Type I (heavy) HMEE below.)  Tentatively, TACOM plans to award a Research and Development (R&D) contract in FY 2002 and a production contract in FY 2005.  The purpose of this announcement is twofold: &#61623; Provide offerors early opportunity to review the critical HMEE draft solicitation documents in draft form &#61623; Provide offerors the opportunity to give feedback to the Government concerning the draft solicitation and its requirements Please note that the schedule, technical requirements, and program strategy are subject to change. This draft solicitation is only for the acquisition of the Type I (heavy) HMEE. The Government is planning to host an Industry Day to receive feedback from industry.  This announcement will be posted on the HMEE website in the near future.  However, if you have questions and/or comments please feel free to submit them at anytime. The final solicitation will be published after a Milestone B decision by the Program Executive Officer, Combat Support & Combat Service Support. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The HMEE will be a self-deployable excavation system with attachments to execute a wide range of mobility, countermobility, survivability, and general engineering missions.  U.S. Army forces operate in the full spectrum of envir onments and need a rapid excavator to keep up with today’s maneuver forces. It is envisioned that two types of HMEE vehicles will be needed: Type I to meet medium and heavy unit requirements and Type II to meet the specialized needs of airborne and air ass ault units.  The Type II will perform similar missions but meet the transportability requirements that will allow it to be used by airborne, air assault, and light units.  Both types will have the versatility to maintain convoy speeds, rapidly perform exca vation tasks and then quickly self-deploy to the next mission site.  The HMEE will replace the Small Emplacement Excavator (SEE), currently in the Army’s inventory.  The SEE is reaching the end of its intended life cycle and was not designed to meet the re quirements of medium to heavy forces. The HMEE  will be assigned and used by Heavy, BCT (Type I) and Light (Type II) Engineer units as well as selected Ordnance and Quartermaster units.  The HMEE will support early entry operations, supporting Force XXI operations, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT ) operations which are characterized by high mobility, rapid tactical and operational movement and distributed operations.  The HMEE blends speed and mobility with loading, lifting and excavating capabilities giving it the utility needed early in deploymen ts. Therefore, the HMEE will be one of the first engineer systems in theater. Among the tasks the HMEE will perform are: preparing and filling craters on airfields, filling in pot holes, clearing/repairing drainage, lifting debris, loading aggregate required for construction or repair, digging trenches for culverts, and rapid repair  of existing roads.  The HMEE will also lift pallet loads for logistical requirements. For Force Protection and Force Sustainment, the HMEE will perform digging, lifting, loading and trenching operations. A focus of the HMEE BCT mission is to construct ind ividual and crew served weapon positions, and perform line of communications, airfield and rapid road repairs.  In support of major construction projects, the HMEE will aid construction of protective shelters/bunkers, towers and helipads, bridge site prepa ration, assist with the emplacement of LOC bridges, aid in seaport construction, logistic bases operations, and other structures and facilities.  When equipped with various attachments, the HMEE will provide combat deployed units a host of earthmoving and construction support capabilities.  There is no requirement, nor is it envisioned for the HMEE to do large area earthmoving blade work, obstacle blade reduction, or assault breaching.  TENTATIVE SCHEDULE: TACOM intends on publishing a Request For Proposal in 3QFY2002 with a two-year R&D contract award to up to three contractors in 4QFY2002.  Under the R&D contract, test vehicles will be built and then delivered for eight months of testin g starting 3QFY2003.  The purpose of this testing is to mitigate risk by proving out technical capabilities and to provide data to aid in the Phase 2 (Production) source selection process.  TACOM intends to publish an RFP for the production contract in 4QF Y2004 and award the production contract to a single contractor in 2QFY2005.  First Unit Equipped is anticipated in 3QFY2006.  We will field the HMEE with Department of the Army Technical Manuals (DATMs), Electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs), and Interactive  Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs).  We intend on supporting the vehicle with repair parts through a separate Defense Logistics Agency managed contract with the successful offeror.  This includes the use of an Electronic Data Interchange system compatib le with the Army system, and direct vendor delivery of parts directly to the user.
