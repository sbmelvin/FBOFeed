<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is engaged in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of  Limited vs Continuous Isoniazid Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy for HIV-infected Persons in Botswana. 
Within 120 days of the contract award, the vendor shall supply for the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) at the CDC, 3 batches of five hundred thousand (500,000) scored tablets of Isoniazid (INH), ?100 mg? per batch for a total of one million and five hundred thousand 1,500,000 scored tablets of Isoniazid, 100 mg packaged in large containers.  Additionally, the vendor shall supply 3 batches of five hundred thousand 500,000 scored tablets of placebo, ?100 mg? per batch for a total of 1,500,000 placebo 100 mg tablets.  The placebo tablets are to be packaged in large containers, which shall exactly match the above mentioned 100 mg scored tablets of Isoniazid.  The tablets are to be identical in look, smell, taste, texture, and have the same consistency as the actual INH tablets that were manufactured by Versapharm in August 2003.  The tablets will be delivered to the Health and Human Services (HHS) Supply Service Center by the vendor.  In order to eliminate any bias and to ensure research integrity, it was determined to be absolutely critical that the placebo tablets be identical in look, smell, taste, texture, and have the same consistency as the actual INH tablets.  These products are to be produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice, and the active drug (Isoniazid) must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The bottles of active drugs should be appropriately labeled and include an expiration date that should not be less than two (2) years from the date of manufacture of the product.  In addition, large containers of drugs are to be delivered no later than one week after manufactured and shipping cost (FOB destination) should be included in the estimates for the cost of the manufacturing of the tablets.  The CDC and the Government of Botswana are collaborating on a country-wide effort to reduce the impact of the severe HIV epidemic on its population.  Botswana is experiencing one of the world?s most severe AIDS crises that looms as a disaster of unprecedented proportions.  The global burden of HIV/AIDS in Botswana is the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 83% of the world?s AIDS deaths have occurred, and where four-fifths of all HIV-positive women live.  Despite a relative stabilization of infection rates in some countries in West Africa, the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow at an alarming rate in Southern Africa.  Like many countries in this region, Botswana has been disproportionately affected by the AIDS pandemic.  Over 20% of the population are believed to be HIV positive and the Botswana National Aids Coordinating Agency?s 2005 Sentinel Surveillance reports 33.5% HIV infection in participating pregnant women.  Botswana estimates that as many as 25 babies a day are born with HIV.  AIDS-related conditions are responsible for 10% of annual deaths, with women and adolescents particularly at risk. TB is by far the single leading cause of death among adults with AIDS in Botswana.  Based on Sentinel surveys in 2005, an estimated 15% of the total population and 24% of the economically productive age group (15-49 years old) are living with HIV infection.  The rate of TB infection in Botswana (633/100,000 in 2003) is one of the highest in the world.  Under this collaborative activity, Botswana is the first African country to have launched a nation wide TB prevention program using Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) for HIV infected individuals.  This program was initiated in 2003.   Currently, nearly 50,000 HIV infected individuals have received or are receiving IPT.  The CDC program in Botswana is a strong supporter of the IPT program and is providing technical assistance, training for health care workers, supplying educational materials, and supporting program monitoring and evaluation.  CDC?s collaboration includes support to strengthen the IPT program throughout the country through the provision of technical assistance, counseling space, equipment, and materials for program sites throughout Botswana.  As an extension of the technical collaboration with the government of Botswana on IPT and TB prevention for HIV infected individuals, CDC launched a 2000-person clinical trial to evaluate the optimal duration of IPT for the best level of protection against TB.  The clinical trial, which was fully enrolled in June 2006 will compare 6 months of treatment (Government-recommended duration) with 3 years of treatment, once completed.  The CDC has identifed the VersaPharma Incorporated, 1775 West Oak Parkway, Marietta, Georgia,  as the sole source to provide the requirement, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, responsible sources who believe they can provide the required services may submit a written capability statement, via e-mail, no later than 15 days from the published date of this announcement.  Telephone inquiries will be considered nonresponsive.  If no responses are received the award will be made to VersaPharma Incorporated.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (Department), Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), is seeking expressions of interest from qualified small businesses or small business joint ventures or teams to contract with the Department to retrieve, characterize, treat, package, and assist with the disposition of alpha-mixed low-level waste (AMLLW), mixed low-level waste (MLLW) and transuranic (TRU) wastes.  The contract will be performed at the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) located at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site in Southeast Idaho.  These activities are presently being performed by Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI). A processing facility exists and will be used to conduct most contract activities.  Maintenance and (if funds are available) possible upgrades to the AMWTP processing facility may also occur under the contract. The waste may contain both Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste constituents and radioactivity; hence it may be classified as ‚Äúmixed waste.‚Äù  Some waste may also contain Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulated materials such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos. Some TRU waste is remote-handled TRU waste. The contractor must be capable of safely performing environmental compliance, nuclear operations, criticality safety, operational support, safeguards and security, quality assurance, facility management, site transition, workforce management, administration, and project management activities at a Hazard Category 2 nuclear facility.  It is envisioned that this project will continue through 2014. The NAIC codes are 562211 and 562910.

The size, term, and complexity of job; b. Information on your role as either a prime or subcontractor; c. A point of contact (POC) at the agency or prime contractor's organization to verify information, including name, address, email address and telephone number; and d. Information on the specific tasks you performed on the project. 2. A description of your experience either managing a team or acting as a member of a team of businesses working on large complex projects.  Provide POC's (name, address, email address and telephone number) that can verify this experience. 3. A list of any companies you anticipate will be used as subcontractors or joint venture/team members and a synopsis of a proposed management strategy for the relationship. 4. A synopsis of financing arrangements available to you that would support performance under a cost reimbursement contract with an anticipated annual value of $125M and periodic reimbursement of costs after some work has been performed. 5. Any other information you believe would be pertinent to the Department‚Äôs assessment of your capabilities to successfully perform the contract. Information received in response to this notice will be treated as confidential and will not be released by the Department except where required by law. Expressions of interest will be used only for acquisition planning.  The Department will not provide individual replies to the expressions of interest it receives. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT. THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT PAY THE COST OF PREPARING AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to provide professional services related to the renovation and repair of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (JFKC).  The work for this contract will occur at the JFKC in Washington, DC.  The services to be provided are architecture, engineering, and other related specialty consulting.  It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded to multiple firms.
The Kennedy Center's capital plan focuses on infrastructure improvements in the coming years.  All work is federally funded and all contractors, including A/E services, are awarded in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The construction projects anticipated during the period of performance of this contract include the following representative activities: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system modernizations; door hardware upgrades; egress stair tower upgrades; support area renovations; office renovations; storage area reconfigurations; rehearsal room modernizations; curtain wall replacements; exterior marble cladding refurbishment; and other similar projects, typically with construction values of less than $5 million.  Consulting for technical stage system and limited theater improvements will also be required during this time frame.  However, no major theater renovation design work is planned to be awarded under this contract.  No further information on the JFKC capital plan will be made available to offerors during the qualifications submission process.
Services under this contract will consist of some combination of the following:
a)	Planning Services and Consulting Studies.  Work may include, but not be limited to, preliminary design studies, preliminary cost estimates, engineering surveys, or other specialized consulting reports.
b)	Design Services.  Work may include, but not be limited to, all traditional design activities, including production of plans and specifications, code analyses, design meetings and presentations, detailed cost estimates, and assistance with bidding phase activities.
c)	Construction-phase Services.  Work may include, but not be limited to, all traditional construction-phase activities, including shop drawing review, RFI responses, site visits, project closeout activities, and assistance with change management. 
Each offeror's statement of qualifications should outline a complete team consisting of, at a minimum, the following disciplines: architecture (including accessibility expertise), electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, plumbing engineering, fire protection engineering, structural engineering, civil/geotechnical engineering, landscape architecture, acoustics, technical stage systems, theater lighting, audiovisual systems, cost estimating, and security consulting.  The prime consultant for each team shall be an architecture firm OR a mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineering (MEP) firm OR some combination thereof.  
Submission Requirements:
Offerors must submit a completed Standard Form 330 with a brief letter of introduction.  These materials will be termed the offeror's "statement of qualifications."  No other materials may be submitted; any other documents provided will be disposed of without review.  JFKC will evaluate the submissions and select the most qualified offerors.  All SF-330 sections, both Parts I and II, must be completed in total.  Each offeror's statement of qualifications may be no more than 75 pages in total, 8.5 x 11 only, including the letter of introduction.  A specific JFKC requirement is as follows:

SF 330, Part I, Section F: Provide information on ten completed projects (i.e., 100% design or deliverable is complete).  These projects should be representative of the various disciplines of the offeror's team, but only 10 projects total may be submitted (i.e., not 10 projects per team member).  Projects may include either design services or consulting studies.  Include at least five design projects that focus on infrastructure improvements such as those listed above as anticipated Kennedy Center project efforts.  Include at least three design projects with construction values of less than $5 million.  Include a brief narrative for each project, discuss how the project is similar to the JFKC solicitation, and provide an overview of adherence to budget and schedule performance requirements.  Preference will be given to projects that occurred within the past five years and to projects that feature multiple team members (including specific individuals) from the current proposed team.  Firms with multiple offices shall indicate which branch office completed each project.  Include Owner phone numbers and points of contact for each project.
Selection Criteria:
The evaluation factors described below should be addressed in the offeror's SF 330 submission throughout the various sections of the form.
Criteria 1: Professional Qualifications.  Evaluation will be based on the offeror's overall knowledge and level of experience associated with architecture and engineering.  Primary evaluation focus will be on architecture and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineering, although all disciplines listed above will be considered.  Experience of the offeror's team's firms in working together on previous projects within the last five years will be considered.
Criteria 2: Specialized Experience.  Evaluation will be based on the offeror's specific knowledge and similar experience related to the types of projects anticipated under this contract as described above.  Offerors must demonstrate experience with infrastructure improvements and projects of construction values less than $5 million.  Methodology for cost estimating and success in achieving cost goals will be considered.  A project will be considered similar and within budget based on whether it meets the following:  the project has a construction value of $5 million or less; the project involves renovations in an occupied building; the project includes scope similar to the JFK planned projects listed above.
Criteria 3: Location.  It is mandatory that the prime firm has an established office within 50 miles of the Kennedy Center.  In addition, it is mandatory that both the architecture and MEP firm(s) have an established office within 50 miles of the Kennedy Center.  In terms of local geography, Baltimore, MD is acceptable as local, but Richmond, VA is not.  In both cases, established office is defined as established prior to January 1, 2006.  Beyond these requirements, it is desirable that other firms included as part of the offeror's team have offices in the immediate Washington, D.C. area (within 50 miles of the Kennedy Center).  
Criteria 4: Team Capacity.  Evaluation will be based on the offeror's demonstration of the team's capacity to perform work in a timely fashion on multiple projects for the duration of the contract.  Information should be given related to other similar contracts, either current or anticipated, that may affect the team's ability to dedicate resources to the Kennedy Center within 30 days of the date of contract award.
Criteria 5: Past Performance.  Evaluation will be based on demonstrable success as reflected throughout the SF-330 submission.  Past projects examples should have specific budget and schedule goals; success in meeting those goals should be demonstrated.
Contract Information:
This contract will consists of a one-year contract with four successive one-year option periods, for a total of five years.  The Government may exercise the option periods unilaterally.  The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000 per option year.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.  Each performance period will run 365 calendar days, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever comes first.  
The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  
This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation package, technical information, or offeror list will be issued.  Oral interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as the most highly qualified.  The NAICS Code is 541310.  The response date for submissions is January 19, 2006 at 5:00pm.  All submissions shall be submitted to John F.

<DESC>The Marine and Aviation Division, Code 5300, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD), is procuring a Qualisys camera tracking system. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Innovision Systems. The Qualisys camera tracking system is required to measure and record in real-time 2D, 3D and 6-degrees of freedom (6-DOF) motion at 120 Hz (i.e., roll, pitch, yaw, heave, surge and sway) of a moving platform, with the accuracy of  0.01 degrees (angular displacement) and 0.2 mm (linear displacement) at a distance of 15 ft .  The cameras will be located from the test subject at a distance of 3-ft to 18-ft to cover a volume of 18 ft x 18 ft x 2 ft (at 18 ft).   The system can be upgraded to a maximum of 32 cameras to cover a larger volume.  Active markers can be used for distance beyond 60 feet.  The operating environment can be in the dark or bight sun!  light, and at 95% humidity.  Additionally, it has to be able to acquire up to (32) analog inputs from other engineering sensors (e.g., force, carriage speed), output data in real-time to another computer via analog outputs or Ethernet link, and export data to TSV and Matlab format. The Qualisys camera tracking system was the only system meeting our requirements of tracking the model motions and other engineering data in real-time. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 03/23/07.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under the National Institute of Health intends to solicit proposals with the requisite capabilities to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The current contractor for this project is the CDM Group, Inc.  This requirement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of NICHD, conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior. One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents. Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th to 10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and options for a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students. The U.S. cross-sectional survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The international HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries. Imbedded in the U.S. national sample is a cross-sectional sample for the international HBSC survey which requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students. The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to make this information available so as to enable improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions. Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries. U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries. U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar. Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care. The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.

Description
	This activity will build on successful prior United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assistance developing market value chains in the agricultural sector to include other non-agricultural sectors such as tourism and handicrafts.  Specifically, whereas USAID has successfully supported the development of the Haitian agricultural export industry for a number of years and has  also supported the handicraft sector under a another separate initiative, its support for market value chain development will now be carried out across all sectors where there is the most potential for local, regional and export value-added.  The intent is to gain economies of scale and synergy by combining all value chain analysis and strengthening into a single market-oriented activity.

	The Performance-Based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase the numbers of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities and the income derived there from.   As a result of this activity, USAID expects to see increased incomes, increased trade and investment in selected market chains; increased sustainable livelihood options, and better management of natural resources (particularly soil) by way of increased value of environmentally friendly (non-erosive) products.  The MarChE Project is expected to work in tandem to the maximum extent feasible with other ongoing and planned USAID development activities.

<DESC>For more than 50 years Edwards Air Force Base has been distinguished by more major milestones in flight than any other place on earth. Covering nearly 301,000 acres, Edwards is located in the Mojave Desert, adjacent to Rogers Dry Lakebed. Even though remote, Edwards is home to military and their families, as well as employer to over 8,000 civilian employees. 

Every holiday season Edwards AFB hosts a free, well attended, base wide celebration in support of our military and their dependants. This event meets the needs of a broad demographic by offering holiday celebration options for everyone. Families with children of all ages can participate in holiday themed activities in the winter wonderland. For adults there is typically a buffet with live entertainment. This base wide Holiday Party is a great opportunity to raise customer awareness of your company with this exclusive military demographic.

Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Edwards AFB invites you to join in supporting the moral, welfare and recreation of our military and their dependents by becoming a commercial sponsor for the Holiday Party this season. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. 
	 
In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event. Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered. Request for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than 07 Dec 2007. All offers will be considered.

Unfortunately we will not be able to accept offers for sponsorship from any contractor, including their affiliates, subcontract arrangements, teaming partners, or join venture partners who are currently or intending to participate in any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) or who will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,00 or more. If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the government.

This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non appropriated funds instrumentality of the United States Government and does not obligate appropriated funds of the Government.

<DESC>The primary object of this SOW (called as caDSR Focus) will be to provide technical management and software development including maintenance and enhancements to the caDSR components of the caCORE system.  The caDSR is a standard based metadata repository and tool set for creating and maintaining content. (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/infrastructure/cacore_overview/cadsr). A secondary objective is to provide integration with other parts of the caCORE system such as integration of existing components to fulfill needed feature and functions. This may mean redesigning existing functionality to implement more common software architecture and simplify consumption of caDSR content by end users.  The caDSR consists of following major components:

UML Model Browser(http://umlmodelbrowser.nci.nih.gov/umlmodelbrowser/)
CDE Browser (http://cdebrowser.nci.nih.gov/CDEBrowser/)
CDE Curation Tool (http://cdecurate.nci.nih.gov/cdecurate/)
Sentinel Tool (http://cadsrsentinel.nci.nih.gov/cadsrsentinel/do/logon)
Semantic Integration Workbench (http://cadsrsiw.nci.nih.gov/)
caDSR Administration Tool (http://cadsradmin.nci.nih.gov)

In addition to these components, the caDSR provides programmatic access to the content in the caDSR repository via the caDSR APIs (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/infrastructure/cacore_overview). The caDSR APIs are developed using caCORE Software Development Kit (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/infrastructure/cacoresdk).

Since the caDSR system is part of an integrated caCORE system, in order to respond to end user needs, the contractor team may be required to support parts of caCORE components including: caBIO, EVS, CSM, CLM and caGrid. In ALL cases, the assignment of specific tasks to the resources in the caCORE system will be made by the NCICB project officer with the agreement of the contractor team. The allocated tasks will appropriately match with the individual?s skill level and experience.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other  warranties associated with the equipment and software.  2.  Interoperabilitycannotbe guaranteed..  3.  Support fro functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future  medications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.<BR><BR>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential  sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors. (7) A determination  by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government  will be fair and reasonable.  A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable.  (8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement  of the  reason market research was not conducted.  Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support  their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical  specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP MSA30 External Disk Drives.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/VCSís Data Engineering (DEG) team requires that Oracle application servers (POS) configured with a Stand-by Oracle Server (SOS) have an external disk drive for the purpose of coping redo logs to the SOS in the event that the POS crashes. During the activation of the new IVIS servers on November 9, 2006, the external disk drive from the existing IVIS server, a Dell PowerEdge 4600 was installed to the new HP ML570 server.  The initial attempt caused the IVIS POS to crash. The IVIS database was corrupted and necessitated the activation of the IVIS SOS server and a rebuild of IVIS POS server.  DEG has the following concerns about using the external drive from the old Dell server 1)     Questions of compatibility a.     Servers and external devices that are a few years apart and are from different manufacturers cause an issue of compatibility 2)    The external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm. a.     Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed As an added benefit of adding the disk array we would be able to add additional disk drives to the IVIS servers. This will result in ñ 1)    Redundancy a.     A ìhot spareî disk drive would be added to each RAID drive.  2)    Increased drive capacity. a.     Disk capacity of all ìraidedî data drives will be doubled. 3)     Spreading the database across additional drives will increase overall server performance<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. CA/CST/VCS owns and has in use HP servers, which do not have external disk drives.  During activation of the HP servers, a Dell external drive was connected resulting in a crash and the corruption of the database.  There are concerns of using these same Dell external drives, or any other manufacturerís external disk drive, due to questions of compatibility.  Other compatibility issues include fact that the external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm.  Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed.   The HP disk array is the only alterative that will meet the needs of CA/CST/VCS.  It will be outfitted with twelve 146GB drives each.  In addition, the disk array connected to the server will have a thirteenth drive.  These drives will replace the external disk drives used to store the redo logs in case of a system crash.  The additional twelve drives will be divided between the current RAID 5 drives configured on the servers.  Besides increasing disk space it will also improve the performance of the servers by spreading the database across additional spindles.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>ADDED HP BID CERTIFICATION TERM.  ALL SELLERS MUST BID HP BRAND ONLY, NO COMPATIBLES PER 'HP BID CERTIFICATION' TERM<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) is soliciting contractual support to provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the NIH has a significant program in patenting and licensing inventions with commercial potential.  The OTT currently handles patent prosecution for the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  From time to time, it will also administer technologies for other Federal agencies.  It is expected that OTT will seek to file 200-300 patent applications each year.  Our active patent prosecution docket is in excess of 1,300 cases.  As would be expected in the world?s largest biomedical research institution, the inventions claimed in our patent portfolio fall generally into the following research categories:  biological response modifiers, cancer, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, general medicine, bioinstrumentation, software, and research tools.  However, there are three categories of technology for which patent prosecution services will be required- biology, chemistry, and mechanical/electrical/software.  In addition, ancillary patent prosecution related services, related to Contested Proceedings and Licensing Consultation may encompass any of the research categories.
The period of performance of this contract shall be for one year (12 months), with options renewable for nine (9) additional 12 month periods. This is a competitive procurement using full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541110 with a size standard of $6.5 million. The Government anticipates a multiple award, IDIQ and Time and Materials type contract. One of the contracts will be set aside for a small business concern that is certified by the United States Small Business Administration.  Note:  The Government reserves the right not to award to a small business if none of the small business concerns are deemed technically acceptable.  Solicitation 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information concerning this acquisition, including the solicitation for download and any amendments to the solicitation, will be distributed solely through this website.

<DESC>This is a modified synopsis.  The original synopsis stated that the proposed contract is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns. Offers from concerns other than SBs will not be considered. All responsible SBs submitting a proposal will be considered by NSWCCD. Due to a lack of proposals from small business concerns on the previous two contracts (N65540-05-M-0312 and N65540-06-M5202) the proposed contract is now unrestricted and open to full and open competition.  This change has been made because there is no reasonable expectation that two or more small businesses will submit proposals for this proposed contract.   This synopsis modification was previously submitted under the incorrect solicitation number (N65540-07-R-006).  The correct solicitation number for this synopsis is N65540-07-R-0006.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT MODERNIZATION PROJECT
REFERENCE NUMBER:   MARKET-RESEARCH-02232007

QUESTION AND ANSWER #2


The Department of Commerce published a market research announcement on February 23, 2007 entitled, D - - Market Research Department of Commerce Financial Management Modernization Project.  The reference number is MARKET-RESEARCH-02232007.  A second question was received.  The second question and the answer are provided below:


QUESTION #2:  If a small business intends on teaming with another vendor, how should the submission be prepared? Should the responses for block 7, with parts a-u, be strictly from the capabilities of the individual small business or from a teams capabilities that the small business leads as prime? How should blocks 10 through 14 be addressed?

ANSWER #2:  As stated in the first sentence of the market research announcement, the Department of Commerce is conducting market research in order to determine the capabilities of small businesses to provide services as a prime contractor.  Interested small businesses shall complete the template so that the information reflects the experience and capabilities of the small business as an individual entity.  If the small business would like to identify a potential subcontractor, the information shall be provided in response to block 15 of the template and a separate form may be completed that represents the experience and capabilities of the subcontractor.  If the subcontractor is also a small business, the Government may consider the information as an individual and separate submission.  If the subcontractor is a large business, the information will not be utilized to make a set aside determination.  The intent here is to review the information of the small business in order to determine its capability to prime the work based on its experience and capabilities in meeting the various requirements specified in the template in Attachment 1.  If the small business does not have experience or techniques to address a specific area, it shall be clearly stated in the response to the template completed by the small business.  In addition, the small business would need to address the obvious weakness in managing, as a prime, an area of the requirement in which it lacks experience.  As a result, Attachment 1A will be posted to the market research announcement.  Attachment 1A is a revision of Attachment 1 and shall be submitted instead of Attachment 1.  The basic difference is that Attachment 1A includes a fourth area in blocks 7a through 7u which requests information as to how the small business will manage an area of the requirement which it lacks experience, tools, or methodologies.  Blocks 10 through 14 are specific to the interested small business preparing the response.  It shall not take into consideration subcontractors.  It shall reflect how the small business manages fluctuation in the needs of the Government, the small business past performance as a prime contractor, the small business earned value management system and reporting (experience, acceptance by a cognizant Federal Agency, plan to be compliant, experience in Integrated Baseline Reviews incorporating technical assessments, etc.), the small business performance measures, and the small business commercial standards. These factors are considered essential to the small business and its business operations. Please note - The Government considers a plan to team with a subcontractor solely a plan in the same manner as "we can" and "we will" statements unless there is documentation provided to the contrary.

The date for receipt of submissions is not extended as a result of this posting.  The date for receipt of submissions remains 12:00 noon (Gaithersburg, Maryland time) on March 9, 2007.

<DESC>Request for Information Manportable Power Roundtable  This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to thi s RFI. The DoD Power Sources Technology Working Group (PSTWG) and the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP), is sponsoring an industry/government roundtable on the ability of the research and development/manufacturing base to meet current and futur e needs of DoD for all forms of manportable power.  For purposes of this meeting manportable power is defined as those items that can provide power to the dismounted soldier (i.e. batteries, fuel cells, solar panels, hybrids) and the supporting             items (i.e. battery chargers, cables, adapters).  Participation is open to any representative from industry, academia, or government agency involved in the design, production, use or acquisition of manportable power items.    The goals of the roundtable are: 1.	Establish a forum to openly discuss issues of mutual concern to both the overall manufacturing base, and the various sub-sectors therein, and DoD.   1.	Identify the major industry concerns related to providing manportable power systems to DoD 2.	Create a single point of interface between the manportable power industry and DoD 3.	Establish a mechanism for obtaining industry input on forthcoming technology roadmaps  4.	Identify those members of industry with an interest in participating on the Joint Standardization Board for Power Source Systems (which has been chartered by the Defense Standardization Program Office)  5.	Present an initial draft of the Power Roadmap and request industry input on same. The roundtable is not (1) where the Government provides information on specific programs, acquisitions, etc. (2) an opportunity for a specific company/sector to promote itself, (3) aimed at a specific portion of the industrial/technology base or (4) an opp ortunity for one on one discussions between a specific company and government representatives The roundtable will convene the afternoon of 26 April 2007 beginning at 1:00, which will be at the conclusion of the Joint Service Power Expo, which is being held 24 -26 April in San Diego CA (for details on the Expo go to www.ndia.org).

<SUBJECT>13--Lightweight Baseplate Assemblies
<SOLNBR>W15QKN-07-X-0317
<RESPDATE>031607
<CONTACT>Mathew Jones, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3274
<DESC>The U.S Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  in support of the Product Manager, Mortar Systems, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for fabrication and delivery of lightweight baseplate assemblies for the M224 60mm and the M252 81mm Mortar Systems. The 60mm and 81mm mortar lightweight baseplate assemblies are to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped in accordance with Government TDPs and applicable contract requirements. This notice is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement; a solicitation is NOT available at this time. The 60mm and 81mm lightweight baseplate assemblies to be produced consist of light weight materials to reduce the carry weight of the currently fielded 60mm and 81mm Mortar Systems. The approximate size of the 81mm base plate is 22 inches diameter and 6 inches height. The approximate size of the 60mm base plate is 18 inches diameter and 6 inches height.  It is anticipated that manufacture of the light weight base plates will require the capability to forge and heat treat high strength aluminum to reduce stress and achieve the material strength requirements to meet the required physical and mechanical properties of the designs. Hard protective coat anodizing of the final product will be required.  Potential Offerors must possess prior experience in forging, machining, heat and inspecting high strength aluminum components. Potential Offerors must also have prior experience with designs of similar complexity. The Basic contract calls for production of about eight hundred (800) 81mm mortar lightweight baseplate assemblies. The first option, if fully exercised will be for production of one thousand 60mm mortar lightweight baseplate assemblies and more than five hundred (500) 81mm mortar lightweight baseplate assemblies. Monthly production deliveries will be for up to two hundred (200) total baseplate assemblies consisting of both 81mm and 60mm lightweight baseplates.  First delivery will be one hundred twenty (120) days after U.S. Government approval of the First Article.  Outyear options to procure additional 60mm and 81mm baseplate assemblies are very likely. The anticipated contract will require the successful completion of a First Article inspection.  After successful completion of all First Article requirements, lot acceptance will be invoked in accordance with applicable Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), drawings, and contract requirements. Proof Acceptance Testing (PAT) will be used to accept production run pieces per the sampling plan included in the PAT test plan. The First Article samples will be required to be submitted to the Government seven (7) to nine (9) months after contract award. Interested Offerors should provide, at no cost to the Government, a summary of their firm‚Äôs past experience, capabilities, size of business (small or large business), description of facilities, personnel, equipment, tooling, quality control of material and processes, packaging, storage facilities, subcontractors and major vendors, and any other information and areas of expertise that will demonstrate to the Government that they will be able to achieve the effort described herein. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government; information provided will not be returned.  All responsible, interested Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data and any pertinent information via email, or electronically, No LATER THAN 03/16/2007.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email. The Point of Contact for this action is Mr. Mathew Jones, Contract Specialist, AMSML-AQ-CA, (973) 724-3274. Email your questions to Mr. Mathew Jones at mjones@pica.army.mil This is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.  A formal solicitation is anticipated and a solicitation  notice will be published at a later date with more detailed technical requirements provided. Note 26 applies.

<DESC>B--Request for Quotations, W912DR-07-T-0072 for Data Validation Services for Phase III Remedial Investigation Underground Utility Lines at the Former Lake Ontario Ordinance Works (LOOW), Niagara County, New York is amended to reflect the following an swers to questions submitted by potential interested vendors. Subject:  Questions Regarding Referenced Solicitation 1. Reference Scope of Work - Section 1.0, General Project Information.  How many days from the date of award will the data packages be delivered to the contractor?   Response: The electronic data will be forwarded within a couple of days of the award, the hardcopy data in sample delivery packages will follow within a week. 2. Reference Scope of Work - Section 1.0, General Project Information.  Can electronic data packages (versus hard copy) be supplied to the contractor for data validation?  If yes, can we assume that an electronic deliverable is acceptable in return, as thi s will have an effect on cost?  Response: This question is answered by the content of Section 4.0 (Data Validation Report Deliverables) which states the following: Deliverables to the USACE will include the return of the EDDs (in Excel or MS Access) with the newly populated validated qua lifier field and return of the hard copy data packages with a summary narrative of the validation results for each analytical group within each SDG/EDD and The narrative shall also include hard copy Form I's for each analyte group reflecting edits/changes resulting from the validation.  Instead of the analytical reports being provided hard copy they can be provided on CD instead as stated in Section 1.0 of the SOW.  As part of the report narrative, hard copy of Form Is will need to be provided for each anal yte group with edits on the form resulting from the validation.  Instead of hard copy, this edited Form Is could probably be scanned as a .pdf and provided on CD. 3. Reference Scope of Work - Section 2.0, Sample Quantities and Chemical Analyses.  Are we to assume that all eight parameters are assigned to each field sample?  Response:	Yes all eight analyses, as listed in the scope, pertain to each sample. For TAL metals, two additional metals, boron and lithium, included in list.  If this is not the case, please supply a breakdown of the chemical analyses required for each sam ple.  60 SDGs (sample delivery groups) will be provided that include all sample analysis performed on sample and can range from 3 samples to 22 samples in each SDG. 4. Reference Scope of Work - Section 2.0, Sample Quantities and Chemical Analyses.  Can you please provide the number of sample delivery groups (SDGs) per analysis parameter? Response: See above. 60 SDG.   Sample Breakdown: 221 Soil Samples, 10 rinse blanks, 7 MS/MSD 65 sludge samples, 3 rinse blanks, 3 MS/MSD 111 waste water samples, 3 MS/MSD 5. 	Reference Section SF 1449 - Continuation Sheet, Delivery Information.  The delivery date is stated as 11-APR-2007.  Depending on the date of award will this date change to reflect a certain number of days to perform the work from the date of award? Response: Delivery date to USACE/EA will be 30 days from receipt of electronic data format delivery. 6. Reference Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (SEP 2006), Item (4).  Is there any preferred format or page limitation when submitting our technical proposal?   Response: No.  Please note however four aspects of evaluation of offer, will include, technical ability, price, past performance, and small business participation. 7.	Will the lab data will be submitted to the validator over a period of weeks/months or all at once at the beginning of the project?  Response: Reference Q#1 above.  Electronic data provided within a couple of days of award and hardcopy delivered within a week. 8.	When are the deliverables due?  Page 4 of the solicitation appears to indicate a due date of 11 April 2007. Response: Deliverables due withi n thirty (30) days of receipt of electronic data. 9.	Is there an interim turn-around-time for each SDG or set of SDGs or should a single deliverable be prepared at the conclusion of all data validation activities. Reponse: Single data deliverable should be prepared, to be received within 30 days of data receipt.  However, SDGs can be provided before thirty day deadline. 10.	The Presolicitation Notice says that the work will be Set Aside for Total Small Business.  However, the Technical Data Package says on SF 1449, Field 10, that the acquisition is UNRESTRICTED.   Please clarify which is correct.    Response: This requirement is set-aside for small businesses only.  Unrestricted was erroneously checked when the request for quotations was issued.  11.	 If this is restricted to Small Business, is there a limit on the dollar amount of work (or percentage) that can be subcontracted out by a small business performing work.  I understand that for 8(a) set aside work, the 8(a) company must perform at leas t 50 percent of the work.  Does this rule also apply to small business set asides?   Response: Just as the 8a set-aside, the small business set-aside would require at least 50 percent of the work to be performed by the small business.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP MSA30 External Disk Drives.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/VCSís Data Engineering (DEG) team requires that Oracle application servers (POS) configured with a Stand-by Oracle Server (SOS) have an external disk drive for the purpose of coping redo logs to the SOS in the event that the POS crashes. During the activation of the new IVIS servers on November 9, 2006, the external disk drive from the existing IVIS server, a Dell PowerEdge 4600 was installed to the new HP ML570 server.  The initial attempt caused the IVIS POS to crash. The IVIS database was corrupted and necessitated the activation of the IVIS SOS server and a rebuild of IVIS POS server.  DEG has the following concerns about using the external drive from the old Dell server 1)     Questions of compatibility a.     Servers and external devices that are a few years apart and are from different manufacturers cause an issue of compatibility 2)    The external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm. a.     Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed As an added benefit of adding the disk array we would be able to add additional disk drives to the IVIS servers. This will result in ñ 1)    Redundancy a.     A ìhot spareî disk drive would be added to each RAID drive.  2)    Increased drive capacity. a.     Disk capacity of all ìraidedî data drives will be doubled. 3)     Spreading the database across additional drives will increase overall server performance.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. CA/CST/VCS owns and has in use HP servers, which do not have external disk drives.  During activation of the HP servers, a Dell external drive was connected resulting in a crash and the corruption of the database.  There are concerns of using these same Dell external drives, or any other manufacturerís external disk drive, due to questions of compatibility.  Other compatibility issues include fact that the external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm.  Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed.   The HP disk array is the only alterative that will meet the needs of CA/CST/VCS.  It will be outfitted with twelve 146GB drives each.  In addition, the disk array connected to the server will have a thirteenth drive.  These drives will replace the external disk drives used to store the redo logs in case of a system crash.  The additional twelve drives will be divided between the current RAID 5 drives configured on the servers.  Besides increasing disk space it will also improve the performance of the servers by spreading the database across additional spindles.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>ADDED HP BID CERTIFICATION TERM.  ALL SELLERS MUST BID HP BRAND ONLY, NO COMPATIBLES PER 'HP BID CERTIFICATION' TERM<BR><BR>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/VCSís Data Engineering (DEG) team requires that Oracle application servers (POS) configured with a Stand-by Oracle Server (SOS) have an external disk drive for the purpose of coping redo logs to the SOS in the event that the POS crashes. During the activation of the new IVIS servers on November 9, 2006, the external disk drive from the existing IVIS server, a Dell PowerEdge 4600 was installed to the new HP ML570 server.  The initial attempt caused the IVIS POS to crash. The IVIS database was corrupted and necessitated the activation of the IVIS SOS server and a rebuild of IVIS POS server.  DEG has the following concerns about using the external drive from the old Dell server 1)     Questions of compatibility a.     Servers and external devices that are a few years apart and are from different manufacturers cause an issue of compatibility 2)    The external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm. a.     Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed As an added benefit of adding the disk array we would be able to add additional disk drives to the IVIS servers. This will result in ñ 1)    Redundancy a.     A ìhot spareî disk drive would be added to each RAID drive.  2)    Increased drive capacity. a.     Disk capacity of all ìraidedî data drives will be doubled. 3)     Spreading the database across additional drives will increase overall server performance. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system.<BR><BR>CA/CST/VCS owns and has in use HP servers, which do not have external disk drives.  During activation of the HP servers, a Dell external drive was connected resulting in a crash and the corruption of the database.  There are concerns of using these same Dell external drives, or any other manufacturerís external disk drive, due to questions of compatibility.  Other compatibility issues include fact that the external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm.  Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed.   The HP disk array is the only alterative that will meet the needs of CA/CST/VCS.  It will be outfitted with twelve 146GB drives each.  In addition, the disk array connected to the server will have a thirteenth drive.  These drives will replace the external disk drives used to store the redo logs in case of a system crash.  The additional twelve drives will be divided between the current RAID 5 drives configured on the servers.  Besides increasing disk space it will also improve the performance of the servers by spreading the database across additional spindles.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>ADDED HP BID CERTIFICATION TERM.

<SUBJECT>B -- Biological Survey of Trident Submarine Basin, Port Canaveral FL
<SOLNBR>FA2521-07-T-0103
<RESPDATE>030907
<ARCHDATE>04022007
<CONTACT>Cynthia Rael, Contract Specialist, Phone 853-0878, Fax null, Email cynthia.rael@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this scope of work is to offer a list of research initiatives which will combine to provide a comprehensive inventory of the marine flora and fauna inhabiting hard bottom (rock revetments and wharf structures), soft bottom and pelagic habitats of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Trident Submarine Basin, Port Canaveral FL.  Tasks listed address managed species (e.g. manatees, reef fishes) or will generate estimates of diversity and relative abundance for important groups of marine organisms.

In order to document seasonal changes in abundance for common organisms and record the presence of less common or seasonally occurring species, this biological survey will last a minimum of one year.  In certain cases, the feasibility of individual collection techniques remains unclear and will be dependent on security concerns as well as the physical conditions encountered within the Trident Basin.  Otherwise, the relative effort and sampling schedule assigned to each proposed task will be dictated by the 45th Civil Engineering Squadron (45 CES/CEV).  The contractor must possess the educational background, field expertise and analytical skills necessary to satisfactorily complete all proposed research.

The Trident Submarine Basin biological survey would employ various scientific techniques to identify, document and quantify the diversity of marine habitats and organisms found within this Department of Defense (DoD) owned portion of Port Canaveral FL.  The contractor would provide the findings of this survey in a written report, including maps, photos, tables and management recommendations, as applicable.  The survey will provide data necessary to appropriately manage the resources contained within the Trident Submarine Basin.

Proposed Tasks:
Task 1: Aerial manatee surveys within the Trident Basin
Task 2: Continuous water quality monitoring
Task 3: Video documentation of Trident Basin marine habitat types
Task 4: Quantification of fish abundance and diversity
Task 5: Data management, analyses and synthesis

Staff Qualifications:
The qualifications of the personnel conducting the survey are very important.  All personnel must be well qualified graduate marine biologists and the project manager should hold a doctoral degree in marine biology or one of the related disciplines.  Experience should include, but may not be limited to, experience conducting estuarine, coastal, surf zone, ichthyoplankton and reef fish surveys, use of ichthyocides, aerial manatee counts, sea turtle netting and water quality assessments.  Contractor should also have experience in univariate and multivariate statistical techniques, experience conducting sea turtle netting, acoustic telemetry techniques, macro algae identification and must employ a U.S. Coast Guard certified boat captain when operating watercraft within the DoD owned basin.

This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Any interested contractors please provide work capabilities and qualifications for this type of work along with CAGE code.  Submit all responses to this notice to cynthia.rael@patrick.af.mil

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY?No Solicitation is available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This announcement is for the purposes of conducting market research.  Interested parties need to identify if they fall into one of the Small Business categories: Small Business, Hub Zone Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman Owned Small Business, or Small Disadvantaged Business.  A Firm-Fixed-Price contract is contemplated to include a contract period of a base period (1 Jul 07 - 30 Sep 07) plus four option years from the date of contract award.  

The Air Force intends to purchase specialized professional engineering services, simulator systems and components, and related equipment and supplies in support of the 412 Test Wing Electronic Warfare Group (EWG) at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, CA.  The primary programs that will be supported by the contractor will include the Air Warfare Mission Simulator (AWMS), Joint Strike Fighter (F-35/JSF) Simulator, and the Test and Evaluation, Modeling and Simulation (TEMS) capabilities.  These services will require technical expertise in developing manned flight simulators through simulation engineering, capabilities integration, systems (hardware and software) engineering, testing, analysis, and technical documentation?with mission critical support for the operations, maintenance, and upgrades of the AFFTC?s Manned Flight Simulators (MFS) and related systems infrastructure.

The following is the Statement of Work that is planned to be in the subsequent award.

1.0  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
This description of supplies and services outlines the requirements for a simulation engineering and capabilities integration contract in support of the AFFTC/412 TW/EWG organization.  The tasks will be managed by the Modeling Simulation and Integration (MSI) program (412 TW/DRP) to deliver specified capabilities for the 772nd Test Squadron / EWOS, of the 412 TW/EWG--the premier Electronic Warfare (EW) ground Test & Evaluation (T&E) Squadron for DoD.

1.1  Air Warfare Mission Simulator (AWMS) Support:  It is a natural extension of the AFFTC's Test and Evaluation (T&E) expertise to provide manned weapon systems simulators in support of all phases of the acquisition process.  The 412 TW/EWG?s Avionics Test and Integration Complex (ATIC) provides real-time man-in-the-loop and non-real-time constructive simulations to support test and evaluation. Simulators are primarily used to reduce risk and increase confidence in flight testing, as well as envelope expansion, maneuver/practice definition, flight control system failures, aircrew and engineer training, pilot/vehicle interface, accident/anomaly investigation, parameter sensitivity studies, and test mission rehearsal planning/dry runs.  The Flight Simulation Modernization (FSM) project upgraded the ATIC simulator capabilities with high fidelity reconfigurable cockpits and new 360 degree visual systems.  The FSM simulators, now designated the Manned Flight Simulators (MFS), continue to be acquired and upgraded to enhance the capability of the Air Force to carry out Performance and Flying Qualities testing, Emergency Procedures Training, Pilot and Ground Team Test Mission Rehearsal development, as well as planned Mission Effectiveness support (for Full Avionics Missions, Pilot and Ground Team Test Mission Rehearsal and Training).  

1.2  Joint Strike Fighter (F-35/JSF) Simulator Support:  The purpose of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is to affordably develop the next generation strike fighter weapons system to meet an advanced threat, while improving lethality, survivability, and supportability to meet the multi-role air-to-ground and air-to-air (warfare or weapon systems) requirements of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as the British Royal Navy?and other international partners.  The AFFTC Manned Mission Simulators (AMMS) at Edwards AFB will be one of two Government facilities (and the only Air Force site) at which virtual simulation activities for the JSF will be conducted along with the Lockheed Martin Manned Tactical Simulator (MTS).  The focus of the simulation efforts at AMMS will be to assess the effectiveness of the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier variant (CV), and short takeoff-vertical landing (STOVL) variants of the JSF.  The JSF is now designated the F-35 Lightning-II.

1.3  Test and Evaluation, Modeling and Simulation (TEMS) Support:  The Test and Evaluation, Modeling and Simulation (TEMS) facility supports the AFFTC mission by planning, developing, integrating, maintaining, and executing models and simulations for Airframe, Propulsion, and Avionics (APA) testing and Electronic Warfare (EW) testing.  In order to support this mission critical capability, the contractor is required to plan, develop, integrate, maintain, and execute software models of weapon systems within a constructive (non-real-time) and virtual (real-time) simulation framework, and to develop and maintain all necessary support hardware and software required to run these models.  Also required is the integration of hardware and software components to create and sustain specific aircraft simulators.

1.4  Interrelated Requirements:  The AWMS project is developing simulation capabilities that will reside in the TEMS facility and be operated by 772nd TS / EWOS personnel.  One of the major capabilities being developed under this contract effort is the development of simulation capabilities to support the JSF flight test program.  It is imperative that all three programs, AWMS, JSF and TEMS, work closely together in the design, development, implementation, and operation of new and enhanced simulation capabilities to ensure the requirements of all three programs are met. 

1.5  The purpose of this contract is to provide for the planning, systems (hardware and software) identification, acquisition support, test, integration and installation, software development, configuration management and documentation, TEMS facility and infrastructure layouts and enhancements, technical training, technical support, etc. that must continue in order to realize the planned Modeling Simulation and Integration (MSI) program objectives, and achieve complete operational AWMS, JSF and TEMS capabilities for the 772nd TS, 412 TW/EWG.

2.0  SCOPE    
Specific attention shall be paid to the AWMS, JSF and TEMS programs to achieve initial  and future operational capabilities as defined in the respective technical requirements documentation and/or road maps.  Additionally, specific knowledge and experience, to assure meeting mission essential test & evaluation requirements, shall be applied in the areas of: MSI system concepts; MFS design enhancements/upgrades, hardware and software testing; MSI data collection and evaluation; MFS set-up, operation and reliability-availability-maintainability (RAM) data collection.  As indicated, this effort focuses on a number of aspects that will ensure the establishment of multiple mission-capable MFS?s in terms of design, construction, operational aspects, implementation and training, planning aspects, equipment installation and integration, and technical documentation.  The end result is to establish and achieve initial and future AWMS operational capabilities within a TEMS facility that is totally responsive to evolving customer mission requirements (e.g. JSF Mission Rehearsal, Mission Effectiveness).

Description 
Currently DMID has a contract that provides regulatory support services including data and document collection and compilation for regulatory filing (pre-IND, IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among other services. The intent of this initiative is to continue such services.  Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.  Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaisons with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic INDs (monoclonal), 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  In addition, it is anticipated that Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) will be required during the contract period of performance.  Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements: Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors? qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following: 1) Relevant experience in the review, preparation and submission of regulatory documents, such as Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. 2) Ability to conduct regulatory and training activities. 3) Ability to provide specialized regulatory expertise, e.g., assay development and validation, and to provide and/or oversee regulatory audits. 4) Ability to provide, maintain and operate regulatory database information systems. 5) Ability to coordinate regulatory support functions with other clinical research support contractors. 6) Capacity and facilities to perform regulatory tasks. 7) Ability to provide personnel who have the training, expertise, and experience necessary to accomplish the full scope of regulatory requirements. Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.  Past Performance:  Past performance is considered essential. In addition to demonstrating that they have met the above qualifications, interested parties must identify at least three other projects of similar size and complexity. All capable small business organizations are encouraged to submit capability statements based on this announcement.  Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.

<DESC>The U.S Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  in support of the Product Manager, Mortar  Systems, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for  fabrication and delivery of lightweight baseplate assemblies for the M224 60mm and the M252 81mm Mortar Systems. The 60mm and 81mm mortar lightweight  baseplate assemblies are to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged,  and shipped in accordance with Government TDPs and applicable contract  requirements. This notice is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement; a solicitation  is NOT available at this time. The 60mm and 81mm lightweight baseplate assemblies to be produced consist of  light weight materials to reduce the carry weight of the currently fielded  60mm and 81mm Mortar Systems. The approximate size of the 81mm base plate is 22 inches diameter and 6 inches height. The approximate size of the 60mm base plate is 18 inches diameter and 6 inches height.  It is anticipated that  manufacture of the light weight base plates will require the capability to  forge and heat treat high strength aluminum to reduce stress and achieve the material strength requirements to meet the required physical and mechanical properties of the designs. Hard protective coat anodizing of the final product will be required.  Potential Offerors must possess prior experience in  forging, machining, heat and inspecting high strength aluminum components. Potential Offerors must also have prior experience with designs of similar  complexity.	 The Basic contract calls for production of about eight hundred (800) 81mm  mortar lightweight baseplate assemblies. The first option, if fully exercised will be for production of one thousand 60mm mortar lightweight baseplate  assemblies and more than five hundred (500) 81mm mortar lightweight baseplate  assemblies. Monthly production deliveries will be for up to two hundred (200)  total baseplate assemblies consisting of both 81mm and 60mm lightweight  baseplates.  First delivery will be one hundred twenty (120) days after U.S.  Government approval of the First Article.  Outyear options to procure additional 60mm and 81mm baseplate assemblies are very likely. The anticipated contract will require the successful completion of a First  Article inspection.  After successful completion of all First Article  requirements, lot acceptance will be invoked in accordance with applicable  Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), drawings, and contract requirements.  Proof Acceptance Testing (PAT) will be used to accept production run pieces  per the sampling plan included in the PAT test plan. The First Article  samples will be required to be submitted to the Government seven (7) to nine (9) months after contract award. Interested Offerors should provide, at no cost to the Government, a summary of  their firm‚Äôs past experience, capabilities, size of business (small or large  business), description of facilities, personnel, equipment, tooling, quality  control of material and processes, packaging, storage facilities,  subcontractors and major vendors, and any other information and areas of  expertise that will demonstrate to the Government that they will be able to  achieve the effort described herein. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government;  information provided will not be returned.  All responsible, interested  Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data and  any pertinent information via email, or electronically, No LATER THAN  04/01/2007.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will  accept written questions by email.

Email your questions to Mr. Mathew Jones at mjones@pica.army.mil This is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement only and should not be  construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this  market survey.

<DESC>The United States Department of Defense (DOD) Program Manger Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP) is seeking sources capable of providing the Program Management Office (PMO) with a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) feasibility Business Case Analysis (BCA) and support recommendation for system level support of the 60K BTU Improved Environmental Control Unit (IECU).  The BCA will identify relative cost vs. benefits of alternative support strategies, the impact and value of Performance/Cost/Schedule/Sustainmen t trade-offs, and data required to support and justify the identified strategy, including recommended performance measurement metrics. The objective is to present a well documented analysis incorporating currently fielded like-system historical data, detai ling considered support alternatives, the methodology used to derive the best value support solution, and other relevant details specific to the process.   The 60K BTU IECU is a compact, rugged unit weighing approximately 500lbs. It is designed for the tactical military environment and will be able to provide supplemental heating capability. It will operate in a wide range of temperature extremes. The IECU wi ll provide dehumidified and cooled air to sensitive electronic equipment without adversely disrupting electrical power. The unit requires unique refrigeration circuits and controls to allow low-ambient cooling operation. The unit also requires protective c ircuits to prevent damage during periods of extreme conditions and to prevent damage in case of faulty conditions. The unit utilizes non-ozone depleting refrigerant. Technical questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email to MAJ Daniels  at regina.daniels@us.army.mil or Ms. Kimberly Hall at kimberly.hall@belvoir.army.mil and no telephone inquires will be honored. All responsible sources capable of providing such a service are requested to submit a capabilities statement. The capabilities statement should identify an overview of the approach to construct a PBL feasibility BCA, qualifications, and experience relevant  to this effort. Respondents are asked to limit their submission to no more than 15 pages. This notice is not a Request for Proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the  evaluation of the information they provide. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in PM-MEPs assessment of capable sources. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. Responses should be submit ted by 4:00 p.m. on March 16, 2007.

The product category includes, but is not limited to, oxygen mask s, tubing and nasal cannulae used to administer oxygen to patients. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best price possible. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the area include, but are not limited to, Madigan Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Bremerton, Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Bassett Army Community Hospital, Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, Fairchild Air Force Base Clinic, McChord Air Force Base Clinic, Eielson Air Force Base Clinic, Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Rob ert E.

This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a se parate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor  Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month o ption periods.  Anticipated award date is Aug 2007.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.     Point of Contact is: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - Patricia.Cordier@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Northwest, Southwest, and Pacific Regions (LSA-West) are seeking product line items in the category of Respiratory Therapy/Oxygen Delivery Products used to delivery and provide oxygen to hospital patients.   The estimated total volume in the three Regions for this product line is over $213K annually. At the request of the Northwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions (LSA-West) Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime ve ndor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and electronic product l iterature to the following individuals no later  than April 2, 2007: Patricia Cordier, RN, MSN:  Patricia.Cordier@amedd.army.mil  Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN:       Cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil Cheryl Janus, RN, MBA:       Cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process for each Region participating in this initiative. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Nor thwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions. They are the decision makers for this initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of the technical criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clin ical/performance evaluation.        The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors fa iling to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best v alue pricing, based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for LSA-West, for analysis. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices could be excluded from RIA award consideration.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the for a two -year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years). The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale with a 1-7 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Slightly Disagree; 4 = Undecided; 5 = Slightly Agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly Agree). The CPT has set a t hreshold of 4.1 for acceptability of products for standardization. All clinical criteria are weighted equally.  Clinical/performance results lower than 4.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The results of the clinical evaluation of the products are the most important factor to the TPRB when making a best value decision.  The TPRB considers pricing a secondary factor.  1. Technical Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: Technical Company Criteria:         1.

<SUBJECT>99--RFI  LDCM FLIGHT OPERATIONS TEAM
<DESC>LDCM FLIGHT OPERATIONS TEAM (FOT) Description This is not a notice for a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI).     The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) plans to issue a RFP in FY2007/FY2008 for the procurement of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) Flight Operations Team (FOT) services. The FOT will operate the LDCM Observatory from the LDCM Mission Operations Center (MOC) located at the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and at a geographically separate Back-up MOC (bMOC) Facility (location TBD) for contingency operations.  The primary responsibilities of the FOT will include LDCM Observatory command and control, mission planning and scheduling, trending and analysis, flight dynamics support (including analysis, planning product generation, maneuver planning and execution), health and safety monitoring functions, on-board storage management, flight software management, mission and flight simulation, and anomaly response.  Prior to LDCM launch and subsequent mission operations, the FOT will have an integral role in Observatory (bus and instrument) and ground systems integration and test; in addition, launch preparation and readiness activities.  In preparation for procurement of the FOT, the USGS seeks lessons learned and other relevant experience in satellite operations that will aid in conducting an effective FOT acquisition.  The USGS solicits all relevant information, but the following sections list topics of specific interest.  PRE-LAUNCH During the pre-launch phase, the FOT will support Spacecraft Bus I&T and Instrument I&T, Observatory I&T, Ground Systems I&T, and launch readiness activities.  These activities will take place concurrently at a variety of government and contractor facilities. 1.	The USGS seeks recommendations for how the FOT may be used effectively during the pre-launch activities.  Responses should identify specific pre-launch activities, the role of the FOT in those activities,  required skills, risks (e.g., integrating FOT personnel with a contractor team), mitigation strategies, feedback and past experiences with integration of FOT members into the spacecraft, instrument, and observatory I&T process, including on-site involvement of key flight operations sub-systems and instrument engineers in I&T procedure development and test execution, and any other information that might be relevant to crafting the most effective approach for FOT pre-launch support. 2.	Training will be provided to the FOT during the pre-launch period.  The USGS seeks recommendations on effective training for flight operations.  Responses could include training content, approaches (e.g., classroom vs. hands-on, use of simulators, etc.), syllabi, schedules, etc.  The USGS is also interested in approaches to capturing and maintaining this initial FOT training for use in training future FOT staff. FLIGHT OPERATIONS Post-launch, the FOT will operate the LDCM Observatory from the LDCM MOC at the USGS Center for EROS located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, using a suite of ground hardware and software that will be procured in parallel or after the FOT procurement. 1.	The USGS seeks innovative FOT staffing approaches that provide benefits and/or reduced cost and risk.  Candidate approaches should include key assumptions, recruitment and retention strategies, position descriptions, a candidate staffing profile, and any further information needed to evaluate the approach.  Approaches may be contrasted or compared with relevant current satellite operations as appropriate. 2.	As noted above, the LDCM MOC will be located in Sioux Falls, SD and represents the first MOC to be established at the EROS facility and in the Sioux Falls area.  The USGS seeks lessons-learned and approaches on staffing the MOC at this facility.  Responses should include ability to effectively address on-orbit anomalies, attract and retain needed expertise, and methods of addressing attrition/turnover. PROCUREMENT The following topics concern the FOT acquisition approach. 1.	For the LDCM FOT, the USGS is considering a performance-based acquisition (FAR 37.6).  USGS seeks suggestions of appropriate performance measures, metrics and performance thresholds for a FOT, as well as any lessons-learned on the use of performance-based contracts in a satellite operations environment. Information responding to this request should be received within 21 calendar days from publication of this notice.   Concise responses are encouraged and appreciated; it is not necessary to respond to all parts of this RFI.  Organizations interested in providing responses or additional information in person are requested to schedule a briefing/meeting at the USGS Center for EROS.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Parking
<DESC>The USDA, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to make a sole source award as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) for a total of 409 parking spaces at 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA.  The contract will be awarded with a base period of 4 months, 9 one year option periods, and another option period of 8 months for a total of 120 months.  JLL is the current owner of the parking garage at Park Center, and there are no other parking facilities that can accommodate this request.  The reason for this action is that the parking spaces were left out of the new lease between GSA and JLL.  These spaces were negotiated and paid for under the previous leases between GSA and any previous owners of Park Center.  Due to the location of Park Center, there is not adequate access to public transportation for the employees of FNS.  Parking remains a condition of employment that is negotiated with the National Treasury Employees Union.

<SUBJECT>D -- Maintenance and Support Contract for MSG Re-Transmission System
<DESC>The U.S. Dept of Commerce , NOAA intends to award a contract to VCS Aktiengesellschaft, Borgmannstrasse 2, 44894 Bochum, Germany under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source is available to satisfy the agency requirement for a maintenance support contract to maintain the integrity of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) U.S. Relay System.  The MSG Relay System and software was developed and installed by VCS in 2003 and NOAA has engaged their services for twenty-four/seven support since that time.  NOAA requires the continuity of the on-call expertise that only the developer of the software code can offer during system problems. This relay system provides critical world-wide data for use in environmental forecasting. If this equipment and software were not properly maintained and the transmission of this data is interrupted, there could be a serious threat to life and property.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to issue a Supplemental Agreement expanding the scope of work under Contract No. DTFR53-04-D-0004 with Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., for project work entitled, Benefit ? Cost Analysis and Implementation Plan for Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking Technology in the Railroad Industry.  The estimated cost for work performed under this action is $400,000.  The incumbent has been successfully performing under this contract since September, 2004.  The expanded Statement of work will continue the highly specialized analyses, and FRA has concluded that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or could result in the unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency requirement.  Therefore, FRA intends to contract for this work under authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance for an anticipated new task order under the expanded effort shall not exceed 2-years.  The purpose of this task order will be to verify the business benefits following ECP implementation.  The task will compare cost of operating like train sets over the same origination/destination pairs with conventional brakes versus those operating with ECP brakes.  Carriers intending to operate ECP brake outfitted trains will need regulatory relief from FRA and have the required waiver in place before commencement of operations and data collection.  It is anticipated that railroads and shippers will benefit from ECP implementation and operation but this needs confirmation.  

The Statement of Work for this effort is available 45 days from the date of this synopsis and shall be made available to qualified contractors upon their request.  Any responsible source may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested contractors should contact Natalie Burgess, Contract Specialist, phone number (202) 493 6149, email address natalie.burgess@dot.gov.  This is NOT a competitive acquisition and no competitive Request for Proposals is available.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 0002, W912DR-07-S-0002.  THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS NOT A COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED.   USACE Baltimore District  Sources Sought: NGA New Campus East Questions and Answers regarding the draft RFP for Integrated Design Bid Build (IDBB) How are National Environmental Policy Act requirements being addressed for this project?  As required by the National Environmental Po licy Act, the Army is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the BRAC 2005 actions at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. It is currently anticipated that this process will culminate in a Record of Decision (ROD) in September 2007. This procurement is based on the Armys preferred site plan as identified by the Army on July 27, 2006, which located the NGA campus at Engineer Proving Ground. However, other alternatives are being evaluated in the EIS, and the siting for this project will not be final until the ROD is completed. Under this procurement, offerors will be asked to propose based on the projects preferred si te as identified in the Request for Proposals, and proposals may be evaluated and a contract awarded on that basis. The contract may be awarded before the ROD is completed.  However, the Government will not initiate any physical construction work until the  ROD is finalized. If the site of the project identified in the ROD is different from that identified in this procurement, the Government will make the necessary modifications to the contract resulting from this procurement after contract award.  When do y ou anticipate issuing an RFP for this project, and when do you anticipate contract award? The Government currently anticipates issuing an RFP in April 2007, with subsequent award estimated in August 2007.  Will there be additional opportunities for potential offerors to obtain information about this procurement prior to the issuance of the RFP?   The Government may schedule a pre-solicitation conference in early March 2007 at which the project designer will present a draft of the schematic design for the project. If this opportunity becomes available, it will be announced via the Federal Business  Opportunities.  What will be the source selection process used for this procurement?  This procurement will follow the one-step best value trade-off process identified for negotiated procurements in FAR Part 15. Additional details on the evaluation will b e provided in the RFP.  Will stipends be provided to offerors?  The Government does not anticipate providing stipends to offerors for this procurement.  What are the bonding requirements for this procurement?  As currently envisioned, offerors will be requ ired to provide performance and payment bonds with the penal sum equal to 100% of the contract price. This is an area in which the Government is continuing to consult with industry to determine whether there are more easily achievable bonding requirements that would achieve the Governments objectives.  What type of contract will you be awarding as a result of this procurement?  This contract will be awarded as a Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract (FAR 16.403-2). The Base Bid will be Firm F ixed Price. The optional construction portion of this contract will be administered according to FAR 16.403-2. See FAR 52.216-17 for detailed procedures and instructions related to cost and price administration for the Construction option. This clause requ ires the offeror to propose an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP/Guarantee Maximum Price) for the option. It is anticipated that after the production point (approximately 100% design), the Government and the Contractor will negotiate a firm fix ed price for the entire contract.  What is the Initial Target Price?  The Initial Target Price is made up of two components, the Initial Target Cost and the Initial Target Profit. The Initial Target Price is the offerors best estimate of the true cost of the work.  What is the Ceiling Price (GMP)?  The Ceiling Price (GMP) represents the Governments maximum liability for the scope of work identified in this procurement.  What documents will be provided as a b asis for offerors to propose an Initial Target  Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP)?  The RFP will contain a schematic design for the project. This will include typical plans, elevations, and narratives. It is anticipated that most of the major building system s will be described in sufficient detail to support an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP).  Why is the Government seeking to establish an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP) based on a schematic design? The Governments goal is to contract with a constructor as early as possible, allowing the Constructor to collaborate with the design team. In order to comply with Federal procurement laws, regulations, and principles, the selection of the successful offer or must include price considerations, and the price competition must be based on the entire project requirement, not just an early phase of the project.  Will price be an evaluation factor in determining the successful offeror? Price will be an evaluation factor in determining the successful offeror for this procurement. Non-price factors (e.g., experience, qualifications, etc.), when combined, will be significantly more important than price in the evaluation. The price evaluation will be based on the firm-fixed price base bid items and on the Ceiling Price (GMP) for the option. In addition, the Government will conduct a cost realism analysis on the offerors Initial Target Cost and Initial Target Profit.  What is cost realism?  According to FAR 2.101, Cost realism means that the costs in an offerors proposal (1) Are realistic for the work to be performed; (2) Reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and (3) Are consistent with the various elements o f the offerors technical proposal.  The draft RFP issued in the Sources Sought indicated the offeror must maintain Cost Accounting Standards in accordance with the applicable Contract Clauses  what does this mean?  This provision of the selection criteri a has been revised. The requirement is for the offeror to have an approved accounting system. The approval will be from DCAA, or other cognizant Federal agency. The process is similar to what occurs in a standard Federal agency contract audit, where part of the review is to establish that the offeror has an adequate cost accounting system that allocates costs in a consistent manner meeting requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and good accounting  practice.  Will this contract require use of an Earned Value Management System?  Yes, because this is an incentive contract over $50 M, DOD policy requires the contract include requirements for the contractor to use a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in accordance with DFARS 252.242-7001, DFARS 252.242-7002, and the Guidelines for an EVMS contained in ANSI/EIA-748.  Will you include an economic price adjustment clause in the proposed procurement?  Given the flexible nature of t he IDBB contract vehicle, the Government does not currently plan to use an economic price adjustment clause in this procurement.  The draft RFP indicated that the IDBB contractor would be responsible for the cost impact of all Designers of Record errors an d omissions. Please clarify what responsibility the IDBB contractor has with respect to errors and omissions?  The language on this issue in the RFP has been removed. The Designer of Record retains responsibility for errors and omissions.  However, as part  of the Construction Integration Phase services, the IDBB contractor will be expected to review and evaluate the design documents to help the project team identify and resolve errors.  How will the Government ensure that all team members (i.e., both design er and constructor) work toward t he same goals?  After award of the IDBB contract, the Government intends to modify the designers contract to align the design budget with the Initial Target Price established by the successful offeror for the IDBB contract. The Designers contract will in clude a contractual obligation to design a project within this funding limitation.  In evaluating past performance, what criteria will the Government establish?  The Government is revising its evaluation criteria for this procurement based on industry feed back. Experience will be evaluated in the following categories: (1) comparable size (square feet); (2) comparable complexity; (3) local experience; (4) experience in a CM/GMP environment; (5) experience with fast-track construction.  Will the Government co nsider lowering the $500 million threshold for past performance?  This dollar limitation has been removed from the RFP.  Will USACE develop a master site logistics plan and strategy for the EPG construction site?  Yes, this will be addressed in the RFP.  H ow will Small Business Utilization be evaluated?  The evaluation will be two-fold: past performance, and the proposed subcontracting plan for this project. The Proposal Submission Instructions will identify the small business goals.  How will fast-track co nstruction be accommodated?  The Government anticipates fast-tracking the construction for this project. It is anticipated that discrete 100% design packages representing a portion of the overall project will be issued to the contractor. Within 45 days aft er receipt of each final construction package the contractor shall submit an estimated cost for that work and an estimated cost to complete the project. The purpose of this is to assure the Government that the project is on budget. Once this requirement is  completed to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer, a notice to proceed for that package will be issued. The contract will be administered according to FAR 16.403-2. See FAR 52.216-17 for detailed procedures and instructions related to cost and price administration for each of the fast-track construction packages up until the time that the contractor and the Government negotiate a Firm Fixed Price for the entire contract (after the production point or 100% design completion). However, the Governments maximum obligation under the contract shall not exceed the offerors Ceiling Price.  All interested offerors  will have the opportunity to respond to solicitation announcements at a later time.  This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No response is requ ired.  NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All offerors are encouraged to visit the Baltimore District's public website, Current Acquisition Opportunities http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/ebs.htm or the Federal Business Opportunities web pag e http://www.fedbizopps.gov (USE THE BALTIMORE DISTRICT ACRONYM W912DR IN THE SEARCH FEATURE) to view other Baltimore District business opportunities.  It is imperative that all Small Disadvantaged businesses contact their cognizant Small Business Administ ration  Office to obtain Small Disadvantaged Business Certification.  Without SBA SDB certification, a prime contractor nor a federal agency can receive SDB credit when utilizing non-certified SDB contractors/subcontractors.
