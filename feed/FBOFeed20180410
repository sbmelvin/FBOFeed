<p>FDsys/govinfo background</p>
<p>Govinfo (formerly referred to as GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys)) is a content management system, preservation repository, and public website that manages, preserves, and provides free online access to current and historical information from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the United States Federal Government today and into the future. Please refer to the System Architecture document at https://www.govinfo.gov/sites/default/files/media/FDsys_Architecture_v5.pdf for additional technical information and the govinfo about pages at https://www.govinfo.gov/about for a user-focused description of the public access website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission of the FDsys/govinfo Program ("Program") is to provide the knowledge, tools, and processes to manage, preserve, and provide access to electronic Federal Government publications. The vision of the Program is to operate an efficient and effective software development program that delivers results and delights users through the use of innovative open technologies. Program values include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Agility - Rapidly and efficiently adapting to external changes.</li>
<li>Flexibility - Recognizing when something is not working and adjusting to deliver results. </li>
<li>Creativity - Generating original thoughts and ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></li>
<li>Innovation - Implementing new solutions that have a positive impact.</li>
<li>Collaboration - Bringing our unique knowledge, skills, and abilities together.</li>
<li>Teamwork - Working together to achieve our shared goals.</li>
<li>Dependability - Competently and consistently taking care of business.</li>
<li>Reliability - Assisting and supporting stakeholders in their time of need.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to operational support tasks, key efforts for each strategic goal are undertaken based upon identified stakeholder need and agency priority. A few examples that demonstrate the breadth of historical key efforts include developing the govinfo beta website, replacing the legacy FDsys search engine with SOLR, upgrading Documentum Content Server and WebTop, migrating to Jenkins, providing access to Bill Status XML Bulk Data, performing a hardware refresh at the Production and Continuity of Operations instances, providing public access to the Digitized Bound Congressional Record, performing bug fixes and enhancements, and implementing HTTPS on the public website.</p>
<p>To implement key efforts, the Program release cycle includes four planned quarterly releases each fiscal year. Each release includes planning, development, integration, and testing activities that are performed within two week sprints in the Integration, Quality Assurance, and Stage environments followed by one week of activities to deploy to the Production and Continuity of Operations environments. Operational support tasks to monitor the system and provide corrective and adaptive maintenance are performed each day throughout the release cycle.</p>
<p>The Program is currently comprised of multiple onsite, collocated teams that perform specific development and support activities; and teams generally employ either agile Scrum or Kanban practices based on the scope of work to be performed by each team. Generally and as applicable for each team, the roles of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are performed by GPO personnel and rest of the team is comprised of contracted development and support team members.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is expected to be a base one (1) year with four (4) one year options.</p>

<p><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Point of Contact: Ashley M. VanDenTop, Contracting Officer, Phone (315)-330-4457, Email: <a href="mailto:Ashley.VanDenTop@us.af.mil">Ashley.VanDenTop@us.af.mil</a><br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate, Rome NY (AFRL/RI), has a requirement to perform research, development, prototyping, integration, testing, demonstration, deployment and maintenance of innovative technologies and concepts in support for Global Application Research, Development, Engineering and Maintenance (GARDEM) software baselines. GARDEM provides Air Force, Department of Defense, Intelligence Community (IC) and other Federal Agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity, and association information, report generation, incident reporting, workflow, and query/search. Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System (WebTAS) Enterprise (WE), Combined Information Data Network Exchange (CIDNE), International Distributed Uniform Reporting Environment (INDURE) and Runway make up the primary software applications in the GARDEM toolset. The flexible toolset architecture provides access to multiple data sources, data mining, information fusion, and collaboration tools that facilitate trend, link, pattern, and distributed analysis to support activity prediction and customer unique capabilities. This effort will perform research and development, design, analysis, studies, engineering, integration, test, evaluation and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the GARDEM software toolset. Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation. The enhancements will extend GARDEM toolset functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users. Due to real world events, rapid software releases are required to maximize our technological capabilities at current and future deployed sites worldwide. Installation support will be needed to install the GARDEM toolset software and hardware, and train users at multiple sites throughout the world. For example, sites such as United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), which involve contingency operations and quick response to warfighter needs will require this installation support. Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system maintenance to current customer sites and to the new sites after system installation. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide. Anticipated deliverables include software, hardware, and technical documentation.<br /><br />For the aforementioned requirements, the Government anticipates award of a multiple-award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Completion (CPFF/C), Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Term (CPFF/T) and Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders. Anticipated ordering period for basic IDIQ is 60 months. Taking into consideration the real world events currently unfolding, the Government presently contemplates the maximum ordering amount to be approximately $427,000,000 for this 60 month ordering period. <br /><br />Foreign Allied Participation at the prime contractor level shall NOT be permitted for this effort.<br /><br />A technical library relating to the subject area of this acquisition will be made available via Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E). In order to gain access to DI2E and the read library, interested vendors will first need to request access through AFRL/RI personnel. Full instructions and contact information will be provided at a later date, via FedBizOpps. For planning purposes, interested vendors who wish to gain access to the source code will be required to sign a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) pertaining to source code as well as furnish a copy of their company's DD Form 2345 - Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. Upon the Request for Proposal (RFP) closing date, those companies having access to the source code will be required to completely and entirely remove it from their systems and provide evidence of such to AFRL/RI personnel.<br /><br />Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Request For Information (RFI) announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside could not be established. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511, with the small business standard being average annual receipts totaling &lt; $27.5M. <br /><br />A Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort is anticipated to be released during the 4th quarter of CY 2018. Potential offerors will be encouraged to review and comment on the Draft Request for Proposal, including Section L and M. A more specific date for Draft Request for Proposal release has not yet been determined. Continue to monitor the FedBizOpps link for this opportunity for updates in this regard.<br /><br />THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES (FEDBIZOPPS) WEB SITE AT <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/">http://www.fedbizopps.gov/</a>. The FedBizOpps offers a registration service that will send an e-mail notification when a change is made to this announcement.

Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Lisette LeDuc, Building 15, Room 225, 1864 4th Street, Wright Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130; COM (937) 904-4407.

Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br /><strong>Point of Contact<br /></strong>Ashley VanDenTop at (315) 330-4457, Contracting Officer, Email: <a href="mailto:Ashley.VanDenTop@us.af.mil">Ashley.VanDenTop@us.af.mil</a> <br /><br /><br /><strong><em>The Request for Information (RFI), Industry Day Announcement, Industry Day Q&amp;A, and List of Interested Parties from Industry Day for the GARDEM effort were posted on FedBizOpps under Solicitation Number FA8750-18-R-0001.

<RESPDATE>041718
<CONTACT>Kelly Berdar, Phone 5182664604, Email kelly.a.berdar.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br />FOR
<p>Maintenance Agreement for the DMG MORI CNC Production Machines</p>
<p>AT</p>
<p>Watervliet Arsenal</p>
<p>DMG MORI REPAIR SERVICES AND PARTS<br />PURPOSE: The purpose of this Scope of Work (SOW) is to define machine repair services, other materials costs for DMG MORI machine tools purchased by the Army and located at the Watervliet Arsenal. Since predicting specific machine failure details for this equipment is impossible at this time, this purchase description will generally describe criteria/circumstances when this service contract applies, which in turn will require the contractor to provide timely response, successfully performing repairs and provide parts on specific equipment addressed by this document.<br />EQUIPMENT: Repair services, materials, parts and costs required by this purchase description shall be applicable to 8 DMG MORI CNC machine tools located at Waterliet Arsenal to include: DMG MORI HORIZONTAL MILL (3)NHX5000, AND MULTI-TASKING LATHES (2)NT3200, (2)NT4250 AND (1)NT4200.<br />PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Period of performance for this contract shall be one base year from the date of contract award. Upon successful completion of each service call or parts purchase, the contractor shall invoice as soon as possible for each service call.<br />DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS: This SOW is a performance-based specification. The objective of this project is to perform repair services and supply parts for DMG MORI CNC Production Machines located at Watervliet Arsenal. Work shall be performed on an "as-needed_ basis. Below are detailed specifications pertaining to the work included by this project.<br />GENERAL: The contractor shall be responsible for performing all repair services and supply parts required for the DMG MORI Production Machines (subject to the financial limitations of this contract). The work required may include (but is not limited to) machine disassembly, equipment repair, calibration, mechanical component overhaul/machining, minor or major component replacement, industrial control repair, replacement or upgrades, electrical system replacement and repair, axis alignment, etc. The work allowed by this contract shall be above and beyond the warranty covered services and materials. Repair services and parts shall be required on an as needed basis, and performed during normal business hours (Monday through Friday, 0700-1630 hrs.), unless otherwise authorized and agreed to. This primarily addresses repair, or machine failure corrective action services. For the purposes of the cost proposal, the contractor will only address repair activities, and the labor categories to perform this type of effort.<br />POINTS OF CONTACT AND NOTIFICATION: Prior to contract award, the contractor shall identify a notification Point of Contact (POC) for repair notification purposes. Watervliet Arsenal Technical POC shall notify the contractor's Repair Notification POC of the repair requirement, and communicate information as to the symptoms of the machine failure. The contractor shall be required to provide quotes within 24 hours and schedule service within 48 hours of telephonic, email, or written notification of repair. Service must be initiated within five (5) working days of the above notification unless the POC approves or requests an extension thereof. Service must be completed within four (4) working days after initiating work. Parts will be shipped within a timely manner based on urgency. If the performance period needs to be adjusted when delays occur the contract specialist must be notified in writing immediately so that a modification can be processed and authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />ONSITE WORK VERSUS SHIPPING EQUIPMENT/MACHINE COMPONENTS TO DMG MORI FOR REPAIR: Due to the nature of the machine failure, it's anticipated that a majority of this repair contract will be performed by DMG MORI representatives visiting WVA onsite. However, it may be possible that machine components may be shipped to the contractor facility to be repaired, instead. Where a machine failure can be isolated to a specific machine component, and shipping that component to the contractor is economically advantageous compared to the alternative (having a contractor visit WVA). WVA may ship a machine component to the authorized DMG MORI repair center. Under these circumstances, the contractor shall repair the component, and ship the repaired component back to WVA.<br />INITIAL CONDITION REPORT: If the cause of a particular machine failure is unknown at the time of notification, the designated COR may require the contract to provide a machine corrective diagnosis, and repair cost estimate. In this report, the contractor shall provide a report of the condition of each machine before remedial repair, corrections and/or adjustments are made. The contractor will evaluate the machine's condition and provide corrective recommendation, estimating man-hours and materials required to perform repair effort. Machine diagnosis shall define the cause for machine functional failure. The report shall be hand delivered to the designate COR within 1 day of machine failure diagnosis. Report shall be legible, have servicing technicians name printed and signed. Concurrence of the corrective measure by Watervliet Arsenal designated COR shall be received before repairs are initiated by the contractor.<br />REPAIR INITIATION AND WARRANTY: After the WVA COR endorses the contractor proposed repair or parts quote, the Contractor will initiate the repair of purchase request for parts, providing all parts and labor to correct the machine failure. Repair parts and installation shall carry the manufacturers' standard commercial warranty. Contractor shall warrant that services performed and/or parts utilized are in accordance with original equipment specifications.<br />QUALIFICATIONS: All work performed under this contract shall be accomplished by a DMG MORI (factory trained) certified technician, repairman or engineer. The technician, repairman or engineer shall have been formally trained to perform repairs on the equipment requested in the initial designated COR notification.<br />WVA ASSISTANCE: Contractor shall furnish all labor, parts and tools required to perform repair efforts. Watervliet personnel shall assist when possible, however, the contractor should not depend on this assistance.<br />ADDITIONAL REPAIR: The COR shall be notified immediately of any service requirements or parts, when are identified as extraordinary repairs. This would include all parts and services not considered covered in this purchase order. The Contractor shall provide a service report at the completion of each service call. This report shall contain detailed itemization of all parts and labor. Report to be legible, either hand written or electronic (preferred) in a Microsoft Word or Excel format.

<DESC>The Government anticipates release of RFP on or before 04/25/2018.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP) to support National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This will be a follow-on requirement to a previous ten-year contract 200-2018-28045 entitled, "The CDC Influenza Reagent Resource (CDC-IRR)", which was awarded to American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), on September 26, 2008. It is anticipated that the resultant contract, renamed the "The CDC International Reagent Resource (CDC-IRR), will be cost-plus-fixed-fee and will have a period of performance of one hundred twenty (120) months. The applicable NAICS code is 541990. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about April 25, 2018. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>The contractor will produce or otherwise acquire, characterize, store and distribute CDC-furnished NCIRD pathogens and other reagents, including ancillary reagents critical to the performance of CDC-developed assays, and associated with influenza, non-influenza respiratory viruses and bacteria, and other vaccine preventable bacterial diseases as described in SOW. This includes live and inactivated viruses, bacteria, nucleic acids, antisera, proteins, cell lines, hybridomas, monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>The purpose of IRR reagents is to assist in characterization of viral and bacterial pathogens as part of CDC surveillance and emergency response activities to aid in the development, evaluation, validation and testing of diagnostic products, to support vaccine development, and to support other research activities that increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of the public health issues related to these pathogens. The IRR inventory of viruses, bacteria and other reagents will be regularly updated during contract performance to ensure that the catalog reflects current circulating or novel pathogen strains relevant to the ongoing surveillance and research activities of CDC and its partner laboratories. The contractor will ensure that these reagents are available to the CDC, its public health laboratory partners, and researchers and developers for characterization of circulating and novel viruses and bacteria and ensure the ability to ramp up acquisition, production, and distribution activities to surge levels as may be needed to meet the needs of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>All reagents produced by the contractor or its subcontractors shall be in accordance with the format and quality specifications as described in SOW. These reagents will be added to the IRR's existing inventory of over 200,000 vials of viruses, antigens, antisera, cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, plasmids, and other genetic materials, and over 4,000 RT-PCR typing kits and panels. All IRR reagents will be manufactured according to a recognized national or international quality standard such as ISO 9001, US current good manufacturing practices, or comparable standards. Manufacturing batch records documenting all production processes and quality control testing for every lot shall be maintained by the contractor and available for CDC review upon request.</p>
<p>Upon approval from CDC, IRR reagents that have met all required quality specifications will be made available to registered persons and institutions through an electronic "storefront" website, www.internationalreagentresource.org to be provided by the government and maintained by the contractor. The contractor will receive and process reagent order requests from the IRR website via their internal ERP system and manage all shipping logistics to recipient laboratories. In fiscal year 2016, the IRR shipped around 13,000 reagents in 1,675 shipments, 88 percent of which were to domestic states and territories.</p>

VA Privacy Training for Personnel without Access to VA Computer Systems 
or Direct Access or Use to VA Sensitive Information



The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA must comply with all applicable privacy and confidentiality statutes and regulations.  One of the requirements in VA is to have all personnel trained annually on privacy requirements.   Privacy  represents what must be protected by VA in the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information whether the medium is electronic, paper or verbal.

This document satisfies the  basic  privacy training requirement for a contractor, volunteer, or other personnel only if the individual does not use or have access to any VA computer system such as Time and Attendance, PAID, CPRS, VistA Web,  VA sensitive information or protected health information (PHI), whether paper or electronic.  You will find this training outlines your roles and responsibility for protecting VA sensitive information (medical, financial, or educational) that you may incidentally or accidentally see or overhear. 

If you have direct access to protected health information or access to a VA computer system where there is protected health information such as CPRS, VistA Web, you must take  Privacy and HIPAA Focused Training  (TMS 10203).   VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior  (TMS 10176) is always required in order to use or gain access to a VA computer systems or VA sensitive information, whether or not protected health information is included.  Both trainings are located within the VA Talent Management System (TMS):  https://www.tms.va.gov

What is VA Sensitive Information/Data?
All Department information and/or data on any storage media or in any form or format, which requires protection due to the risk of harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information. The term includes not only information that identifies an individual but also other information whose improper use or disclosure could adversely affect the ability of an agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, and records about individuals requiring protection under applicable confidentiality provisions.

What is Protected Health Information? 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines protected health information as Individually Identifiable Health Information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity, such as VHA.  
What is an  Incidental  Disclosure?
An incidental disclosure is one where an individual s information may be disclosed incidentally even though appropriate safeguards are in place. Due to the nature of VA communications and practices, as well as the various environments in which Veterans receive healthcare or other services from VA, the potential exists for a Veteran s protected health information or VA sensitive information to be disclosed incidentally.  
For example:
You overhear a healthcare provider s conversation with another provider or patient even when the conversation is taken place appropriately. 
You may see limited Veteran information on sign-in sheets or white boards within a treating area of the facility.
Hearing a Veteran s name being called out for an appointment or when the Veteran is being transported/escorted to and from an appointment.

Safeguards You Must Follow To Secure VA Sensitive Information:
Secure any VA sensitive information found in unsecured public areas (parking lot, trash can, or vacated area) until information can be given to your supervisor or Privacy Officer.  You must report such incidents to your Privacy Officer timely.
Don t take VA sensitive information off facilities grounds without VA permission unless the VA information is general public information, i.e., brochures/pamphlets.
Don t take pictures using a personal camera without the permission from the Medical Center Director. 
Any protected health information overheard or seen in VA should not be discussed or shared with anyone who does not have a need to know the information in the performance of their official job duties, this includes spouses, employers or colleagues. 
Do not share VA access cards, keys, or codes to enter the facility. 
Immediately report lost or stolen Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHIC), any VA keys or keypad lock codes to your supervisor or VA police. 
Do not use a VA computer using another VA employee s access and password. 
Do not ask another VA employee to access your own protected health information.  You must request this information in writing from the Release of Information section at your facility.

What are the Six Privacy Laws and Statutes Governing VA?
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) compels disclosure of reasonably described VA records or a reasonably segregated portion of the records to any person upon written request unless one or more of the nine exemptions apply.
Privacy Act of 1974 provides for the confidentiality of personal information about a living individual who is a United States citizen or an alien lawfully admitted to U.S. and whose information is retrieved by the individual s name or other unique identifier, e.g. Social Security Number.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides for the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of health care systems by encouraging the development of health information systems through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission, privacy, and security of certain health information. 
38 U.S.C. 5701 provides for the confidentiality of all VA patient and claimant information, with special protection for their names and home addresses.
38 U.S.C. 7332 provides for the confidentiality of drug abuse, alcoholism and alcohol abuse, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sickle cell anemia medical records and health information.
38 U.S.C. 5705 provides for the confidentiality of designated medical-quality assurance documents.

What are the Privacy Rules Concerning Use and Disclosure? 
You are not authorized to use or disclose protected health information.  In general, VHA personnel may only use information for purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations when they have a need-to-know in the course of their official job duties.  VHA may only disclose protected health information upon written request by the individual who is the subject of the information or as authorized by law. 

How is Privacy Enforced? 
There are both civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties that may be imposed if a privacy violation has taken place.  Any willful negligent or intentional violation of an individual s privacy by VA personnel, contract staff, volunteers, or others may result in such corrective action as deemed appropriate by VA including the potential loss of employment, contract, or volunteer status. 

Know your VA/VHA Privacy Officer and Information Security Officer.  These are the individuals to whom you can report any potential violation of protected health information or VA sensitive information, or any other concerns regarding privacy of VA sensitive information.  


YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF OUR VETERANS

<p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The discovery and development of an AIDS vaccine remains among the highest research priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and is a principal mission of NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS). To support this mission, NIAID has provided high-quality, novel, and targeted reagents, assays and services for investigators engaged in AIDS vaccine-related research, including NIAID-funded grantees and contractors, other NIH-funded researchers, and investigators supported through various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These services are provided through this contract by investigator request and NIAID staff approval. The current contract for this work is entitled " Reagent Resource Support Program for AIDS Vaccine Development" and the incumbent contractor is Quality Biological Inc., contract number HHSN272201100023C.</p>
<p>Description <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to produce, procure, store, ship, and maintain an up-to-date inventory of high-quality reagents and assays in support of preclinical and clinical AIDS vaccine research.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: 1) procure, purify, and test reagents, including, for example: viral proteins and peptides, virus stocks, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, vaccine vectors, vaccine adjuvants and cytokines, and any additional reagents deemed necessary for the NIAID DAIDS Vaccine Research Program; 2) perform genetic cloning and sequencing; 3) acquire the needed reagents, assays, and/or services used to evaluate AIDS vaccine safety and immunogenicity; 4) analyze all reagents for purity and integrity, and provide for their quality control and assurance; and 5) provide for receipt and inventory tracking, storage, maintenance, and distribution of all reagents.</p>

The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about January 7, 2018. The requirement will be for the delivery of 2.00 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the above functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, Options for additional level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work. These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Option 1 - 6: Extend the Term of the Contract: The Government may exercise options to extend the term of the contract beyond the Base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years of the performance. The total period of performance resulting from the base period plus all potential Term Options is 7 years. Assume that the scope and types of activities as outlined for the Base Period (Year 1 of the contract) would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period.</p>
<p>Options 7-20 Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Up to Two (2) Options per year may be exercised during years 1 through 7 of contract performance. Should the Government elect to exercise these Options, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.0 FTE for each option exercised. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the base year or the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

(MBA) of Higher Denham, United Kingdom for Lot 34-38 production of Navy Aircrew Common Ejection Seats (NACES) and associated Production Support Services in support of U.S. Navy F/A-18 and E/A-18G production and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) aircraft.&nbsp;<br /><br /> This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As the sole designer, developer, manufacturer, and supplier of NACES, only MBA has the requisite knowledge, technical expertise, required technical data, production tooling, facilities, and experience necessary to support engineering, manufacturing, testing, and logistics tasks associated with the ejection seat. Ejection seats are critical to aircrew safety and survivability in the event of a mishap. Another contractor could not produce and qualify an ejections eat without resulting in significant duplication of cost to the USN and unreasonable delays to schedule and deliveries. It is estimated that it would take, at a minimum, three years to perform the efforts necessary to qualify another source, thereby unacceptably delaying aircraft delivery to the Fleet.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Expressions of interest in subcontracting should contact Derek Lewis at dlewis@martin-baker.co.uk. Any responses to this synopsis must be via e-mail to the Contract Specialist at Antoinette.Daniels@navy.mil. No telephonic responses will be accepted. <br /></span></span></span></p>

ACQUISITION INFORMATION:

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES. Small Businesses must be registered in SAM.GOV. This acquisition is conducted in accordance with FAR Part 36 & 15, Request for Proposal.
The Coatesville VA Medical Center is soliciting proposals under Solicitation No. 36C24418R0071 for the following: Replace Steam and Condensate Mains, Oval 2 and Outlying Branches, Project No. 542-10-101. This project replaces the steam system condensate return mains and portions of the steam distribution mains at drip stations in all of Oval 2, which includes Buildings 38, 39, 57, 139, 58 and 59 and the connecting tunnels. This project replaces steam-to-water heat exchangers, pressure reducing stations in the service rooms, steam main isolation valves and condensate main piping and all insulation. It also converts the heating systems in Buildings 36 and 40 from steam heat to gas-fired heat. Piping replacements mainly occur in the below-floor crawl spaces. Some of the replacements occur in Building 59 basement level support spaces.  Some reconfiguration of service room equipment is required to accomplish the work, including the addition of equipment platforms.

The work includes all associated architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and control work. It also includes temporary/portable steam generator service, temporary piping connections and any associated site restoration. The buildings must remain fully operational while the work is being completed.

The Contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, tools, equipment, transportation, permits testing, reports and supervision as necessary to accomplish the work and in accordance with federal, state and local codes and regulations. All work shall be performed in accordance with the contract, specifications and drawings.

The steam system is a vital infrastructure. Steam must be maintained at all times during the contract to meet the facility needs, except for short-term shutdowns (usually less than 8-hour duration) scheduled in advance with the VAMC.
The contractor must provide temporary steam to meet all requirements during each phase of the work. During warm weather, when heating is not required, the temporary steam would only need to meet domestic hot water requirements.
The portions of the work requiring temporary steam must be done one building at a time unless otherwise approved by the COR.
The contractor must coordinate its schedule with the VAMC and schedule the work accordingly. The work must be scheduled in cooperation with the VAMC to ensure continuity of VAMC functions and allowance for special events such as The Joint Commission visit or special veterans events.
A new natural gas meter must be provided by Pennsylvania Electric Company (PECO) in coordination with the VAMC and the contractor for the work in buildings 36 and 40, which will include the installation of natural gas-fired unit heaters.
There will be no government furnished property.
Temporary Utilities: Limited use of electricity for 115V tools will be available with no charge to the contractor for performance of the contract. The contractor shall provide its own sources for larger loads, such as welding equipment. Domestic water will be available at no charge to the contractor, but the contractor shall be responsible for all temporary connections. The contractor shall provide reduced pressure backflow preventers for all locations of connection to the CVAMC system, and must maintain the temporary connections to prevent leakage.
Adequate space for staging of materials will be in coordination with the VAMC in accordance with the specifications.

The solicitation documents and drawings will be available for download from the website https://www.fbo.gov on or about April 25, 2018. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and updates.
