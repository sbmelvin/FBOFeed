<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR PROTECTED SOFTWARE ADOPTION AND SUSTAINMENT RESEARCH.  The Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) are determined to be more proactive in protecting DoD weapon systems and information systems that are critical enablers of U.S. military combat power.  Due to known threat scenarios, critical national security software must be protected from inception through operational execution.  Tools, technologies, and techniques must be developed to provide robust protection of software code during its entire life cycle: development and test; distribution to operational sites, and deployment in weapon systems and/or information systems.  Development of such tools, technologies and techniques demands specialized and detailed knowledge, skills, and expertise in select high-target national security codes; currently deployed anti-tamper techniques and programs; and high-assurance system security principles, policies, and procedures.  In addition to protecting critical DoD software, the AT-SPI office has a responsibility to study the impact that software protection has on system administrators, end users, distributors, and all parties who are in contact with that software.  Two important components of the overall impact of software protection on the DoD are adoption and sustainment impacts.  The AT-SPI office has protected several codes for the DoD, including the electromagnetic simulation code, Xpatch.  Xpatch has an established user base, and is used at 165 DoD and contractor sites across the country, with more than 1000 licenses issued.  Due to its wide use, Xpatch represents the primary source of data as the AT-SPI office studies these impacts.  The objective of this effort is to study impact that software protection has on the adoption and sustainment of selected software applications.  The parameters to be studied include, but are not limited to, time and effort, cost (both hard cost and labor cost), training requirements, documentation production, integration testing, and logistical issues.  Through this effort, Science Applications International Corporation will develop metrics and schemes for their collection and measurement.  Through the distribution of the Xpatch suite and other applications protected by the Software Protection Center, empirical data will be collected and distilled into adoption and sustainment data.  From this data, Science Applications International Corporation will develop a framework, model or tool for predicting parameters, such as cost, associated with adoption and sustainment of software applications utilizing the Software Protection Center’s software protection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SNT) intends to award on the basis of less than full-and-open competition a contract to Science Applications International Corporation, Champaign, IL, a large business.  Vendors capable of providing the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

DESCRIPTION: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Pacific Wave Industries, Inc., 129 Sheldon Street, El Segundo, CA, 90245 for the purchase of four (4) Four Grams of CX2 EO Polymer Materials.  CX2 is an electro-optic polymer material.  CX2 is a one-of-a-kind patented electro-optic polymer used in the fabrication of RF polymer modulators.  It is the state-of-the-art electro-optic material for modular development.  This polymer is an integral part of an established polymer modulator fabrication process.  Substitution of this electro-optic polymer is unacceptable due to the negative impact on process development for modulator fabrication both in terms of cost and schedule.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received (quote with product specifications) will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is set aside 100% small business. The NAICS code is 325211. This procurement shall be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer, 732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs.  Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in quest ion, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment.  Depending upon respondents capabilities a nd the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment / repair-overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair pro grams that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with i nformation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CC S-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. This synopsis is for informational purposes only and not an offer for proposal. For more information, conta ct Michael E. Harris (732) 532-2453. The deadline for response to this notice is 16 March 2006.

These upgrades were single-system installations and were therefore not integrated with existing systems or capable of utilizing the new equipment’s design capabilities.  Furthermore, the installations were not uniform among the vessels or area commands, and in many cases the systems are not from the same makers.

MSC intends to upgrade the entire bridge, which will require the removal of some systems, relocation of others, and installation of new or up to date systems.  A contractor will design the bridge upgrade at some point in the future.  

Before the design effort begins, MSC wants to capture what’s presently on the T-AO 187 Class Vessels and an overview of how the new systems will be integrated – that’s the purpose of this requirement.

<DESC>“This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.” The Government intends to procure, under full and open competition, a commercially available, non-developmental item (NDI), or near NDI, Improved Crew Served Weapons Mount (ICSWM) for use by the United States Special Operations Command.  The ICSWM must be capable of mounting the General Dynamics Armaments & Technical Products Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL) MK47 MOD 0 40mm machine gun.  The ICSWM is envisioned as a non-stabilized mount using soft mount technology.  This technology should provide for improved slew and firing capability to fire from moving platforms (vehicles and watercraft) and achieve improved hit performance when firing on the move.  Critical characteristics of the ICSWM are 1) must not degrade the reliable firing performance of the MK47 ALGL.  2) The mount must have a Quick Slewing capability providing for both major shifts in azimuth and elevation in a free gun mode and quickly lock for firing.  3) The mount must provide for sufficient mounti!  ng surfaces to incorporate common interface brackets (MIL-STD-1913, etc) for fire-control devices.  4) The mount must provide for recoil buffers for MK47 weapon to isolate sights or other gear affixed to the cradle.  5) The mount must provide common control surfaces (grips, trigger, azimuth, and elevation controls) and allow the operator to trigger the weapon by using controls on the grips.  6) The mount must include a trigger linkage to interface the weapon and mount in such a way as to allow for removal and installation of MK47 weapon in the mount by the gun crew in a field environment without tools.  The following Key Performance Parameters must be met: 7) Weight - The heaviest component will not exceed 39 pounds.  8) Ammunition/Function - The MK47 integrated with the ICSWM will fire all current stocks of ammunition type classified by the US and NATO that are currently fired by the MK19 MOD3 (e.g. M430/M430A1/M383/M918/M385A1/MK281).  9) Mounting - Be capable of being fi!  red from the MK195 MOD0 vehicle adapter in ring and pedestal mounts fo r mounted operation (i.e., M1025 Tactical Vehicle/Desert Mobility).  10) Movement Control - The operator must be able to safely control the weapon while firing on the move on level terrain and ICSWM will not present any uncontrollable safety or health hazards to personnel.   11) Ballistic Shielding - ICSWM will have ballistic shielding that provides the gunner frontal ballistic protection against 7.62 X 51 (M80) ball ammunition.  12) Traverse and Elevation Control - The mount will have a quick, simple and easy traverse and elevation control that meets current range of motion of MK93 (15 degrees below horizontal to 60 degrees above horizontal when vehicle mounted in MK195; a greater range of elevation is an objective).  13) Operability - The ICSWM must be operable by personnel wearing protective equipment required for (NBC) environments and cold weather operations.  14) Ammo Bracket Assembly - ICSWM will have a bracket to fit standard ammunition containers PA120, M549 and PA70.  Ammo bracket must not cause ammo belt twisting leading to gun stoppage within full range of motion.  The contract type will be a Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or to awa!  rd multiple delivery order contracts for the same or similar supplies to two or more sources under this solicitation.  The minimum quantity is 1/EA ICSWM with a maximum quantity of 547/EA, which may be ordered over the five-year life of the contract.  All items shall be delivered F.O.B. Destination to: RECEIVING OFFICER, BLDG 2521, CODE 4081, NAVSURFWARCENDIV, CRANE, IN  47522 5001.  For the minimum quantity, delivery of 1/EA is required 90 days after the effective date of the delivery order.  Any subsequent delivery orders will order between 1/EA and 100/EA with a maximum monthly delivery rate of 20/EA commencing 90 days after the effective date of the delivery order.  The solicitation will require delivery of a single product sample to NAVSURFWARCENDIV, CRANE, IN 47522-5001 by the closing date and time of the solicitation for government evaluation.  All interested parties will be required to provide operational support personnel with their respective product samples.  All!   parties that will be submitting a proposal (including the required pr oduct sample) shall inform the Contracting Officer listed in this announcement, via email, of their intent no later than 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

The product sample shall be delivered at no expense to the Government and will be returned to the offeror, upon written request to the Contracting Officer, after contract award.  The Government shall not be responsible for the condition of the samples due to the evaluation process.  The solicitation will be evaluated on a best value basis and the Government will reserve the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror and other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The product samples must meet the minimum requirements specified in the solicitation to be given further consideration for award.  The technical proposal shall address any dif!  ferences between the product samples and the production units.

<DESC>NAR060061, GOOD QUALITY HAY FOR THE FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA HOLDING FACILITY, FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH TWO 12-MONTH OPTIONS.  Solicitation number NAR060062 applies and will be issued on or about February 29, 2006 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement: The Bureau of Land Management's Elm Creek, NE Holding Facility has a requirement for good quality hay to be delivered on a monthly basis from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, with an option for 2 more 12-month periods. The Elm Creek Wild Horse and Burro Facility is located at 5050 100th Road, Elm Creek, Nebraska.  Offerors shall provide a firm fixed monthly unit price for the base year, option year 1 and option year 2. BACKGROUND - This contract is intended to procure quality hay products for the feeding of wild horses and burros at the National Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek in Elm Creek, NE. The National Wild Horse and Burro program is an integral part of the management of federal lands in the western United States. Every year wild horses that are determined to be excess on the public lands are removed and placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program. This program places wild horses and burros into private homes around the country. The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek (EC) is charged with taking care of these animals on their journey to private adopted homes. A good feeding program is an integral part to the care the animals receive while on the facility. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - The purchase of good quality alfalfa hay helps ensure the good care of wild horses on the facility. The contract will ensure the procurement of good quality hay for the feeding of 400-500 wild horses and burros per day throughout the year. This will require the delivery of hay to feed up to 6.5 tons of hay per day or 195 tons per month (which includes an estimated 700 small square bales, per month) throughout the year. The Hay Contractor shall coordinate all deliveries with the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and the EC Feeding contractor. The Hay Contractor will unload all the small square bales into the BLM hay shed and the EC Feeding Contractor will unload the loads of round bales with the feeding contractor's provided on-site tractor. This is why the hay contractor must coordinate round bale load deliveries with the COR and EC Feeding Contractor. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - The primary, large volume feeding of alfalfa hay is through the use of large round bales. This will be the largest amount of hay needed to be supplied by the hay contractor. EC also feeds animals in the smaller load pens and sick pens using small square bales. It is estimated that BLM will need approximately 700 small square bales on a monthly basis. However, this quantity may vary from month to month depending on the number of animals being maintained in sick pens and the number of animals being unloaded at the facility. Large Alfalfa Round-Bale Requirements: Protein level 16% or higher; Relative Feed Value 125 or higher; Weed level less than 5%; Grass level less than 5%; Moisture content of less than 18%; Hay test available upon request within 10 days of delivery; Weigh ticket for each load to verify weight delivered. Small Alfalfa Square Bale Requirements: Protein level 16% or higher; Relative Feed Value 125 or higher; Weed level less than 5%; Grass level less than 5%; Moisture content of less than 18%; A bale should weigh between 65 pounds and 85 pounds; Hay test available upon request within 10 days of delivery; Weigh ticket for each load to verify weight delivered; Delivered/unloaded as directed by the COR. All hay delivered will be free of dust, mold and heating.  All deliveries will be inspected by the on-site COR/PI, and will be subject to their approval and acceptance, or rejection in the event of shipment of non-compliant hay before unloading. Deliveries will be during normal business hours, Monday-Friday 8 a.m-4 p.m., and coordinated with the COR and EC Feeding contractor. Weekend deliveries will only be allowed after approval by the COR and coordinated with the EC Feeding Contractor. Weigh tickets will be provided to the COR when the loads are delivered to the EC facility. The estimated yearly amount of hay to be fed on the facility will be approximately 2,400 tons in a 12 month period. Approximate delivery schedule for the hay will be once a month but could be more frequent if the quantity of hay being consumed is greater or the numbers of animals being housed increases. Hay deliveries will be required in a timely manner and not drawn out except for extenuating circumstances which will require the prior approval by the on-site COR. Deliveries will need to be approximately on average 30 tons per day or within 5-7 working days. Approximately 700 small square bales will be required per month and can be stored in the shed provided by the BLM on-site. The remainder of the hay to be shipped and unloaded shall be the large round bales, as described above. Special circumstances - Inclement weather in Nebraska is a common occurrence. It is the goal of the EC facility to maintain from month to month a backup supply of large round bales of hay to allow for periods of weather in the form of snow or muddy conditions which may conflict with a Hay Contractor's ability to get hay out of a field for delivery to the EC facility. It is the goal of the EC facility to have 30-50 large round bales on-site at all times to maintain a 3-5 day feeding supply on-hand in cases of severe snow or mud conditions which would impact a contractors ability to retrieve hay from a field to deliver to the EC facility. Thus, it is anticipated that deliveries should begin as the supply of hay on the EC facility is at or about 30-50 large round bales. This will insure the facility has a backup supply of hay at all times in the case of delivery problems such as snow and mud conditions or any other unforeseen conflicts occur. This is not a complete list of the specifications and should be used only as a basis to decide whether or not to review the solicitation. Proposals are due March 29, 2006 by 2:00 PM Mountain Time. Send proposals by U.S. Mail to: Department of the Interior; BLM, BC-663; Attention: Steve Santoro; BLDG 50, DFC, PO Box 25047; Denver, CO  80225-0047. By express or hand delivery:  Department of the Interior; BLM, BC-663; Attention: Steve Santoro; Mail Room, Entrance S-2; BLDG 50, Denver Federal Center; Denver, CO  80225; By facsimile to (303) 236-9421. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Offerors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award of a contract.

Solicitation number NAR060062 applies and will be issued on or about February 29, 2006 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement:  The Bureau of Land Management's Elm Creek, NE Holding Facility has a requirement for feeding services 7 days per week for 12 months, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, with an option for 2 more 12-month periods. The Elm Creek Wild Horse and Burro Facility is located at 5050 100th Road, Elm Creek, Nebraska. Offerors shall provide a firm fixed monthly unit price for the base year, option year 1 and option year 2. BACKGROUND - Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 US. 1331-1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in facilities for preparation to be placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program. The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek (EC) is the primary holding facility for wild horses and burros making there way to private homes across the United States through the Adopt-A- Horse program.  Routinely, EC receives animals from western facilities and conversely ships them to adoption locations around the midwest, southern, and eastern United States. The facility maintains throughout the year 400-500 animals on a daily basis. OBJECTIVE - The objective of this contract is to procure services for the feeding of these animals as they arrive from the western facilities and await transport to adoption locations around the country. EC is a permanent year-round holding facility requiring daily feeding of the animals residing on the facility. GENERAL SERVICES - The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel and equipment to assure the daily feeding on average of 400-500 animals 365 days a year, to include all unloading of large round bale hay shipments that arrive at EC from the hay contractor, which is expected to be about once a month. Shipments may occur more than once a month, depending on the number of animals being maintained at the facility, animal, and weather conditions. Approximately, 195 tons of hay will be shipped per month, and shipments will include large round bales and small square bales. Contractor Furnished Equipment Required: As a minimum, the contractor will provide a tractor or loader with a round-bale grapple loader capable of transporting round bales to the necessary feeders on the facility.  The tractor will be required to have front assist capability because of the steep grades and slippery conditions during wet times. Conditions at the facility can become very slippery and this requirement is necessary for the safety of the contract employees, as well as, the facility fences and ability to get hay to the animals. The contractor provided tractor will remain on the facility 7 days a week to ensure that in the case of bad weather the tractor will be available to the facility to feed horses and not need to be transported to the facility in poor weather conditions. On occasion, with the approval of the COR, the tractor may leave the premises for maintenance or fueling. Optional Contractor Furnished Equipment: A pickup truck to deliver small square bales to the required feeders is optional but recommended due to the ease of driving next to the feeders and delivering the small square bales to the feeders. The facility consists of 9 large outside pens and 21 smaller pens. The outside pens are used to house the majority of the animals and can house 50-80 animals per pen. The outside pens have movable, large round-bale feeders. The smaller inside pens consist of 10 pens used for animals being ready for shipment or adoption events. Five of the smaller pens are used for BLM saddle horses or animals requiring special attention. The smaller pens have hanging feeders requiring the use of small square bales and several have round-bale feeders which can be used. There are also 6 isolation pens used to house sick or injured animals and have permanent feeders requiring the feeding of small square bales. It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel, one to operate the front-end loader tractor and one to operate the pickup on a daily basis, and a second person to open and close gates. The contract personnel will be required to unload all shipments of the large round bales of hay that arrive at the facility, and to haul the large round-bales using the contractor-provided tractor/loader to the large outside pens from a central holding area. In addition, the contractors will need to haul small square bales from a central storage area to the small pens using the contractor provided pickup truck or tractor/loader. It is anticipated that one contractor employee would drive the vehicles and the other would open gates and off-load the small square bales into the feeders. As for the unloading of the shipments of the round bales of hay delivered by the hay contractor, it is anticipated that the contractor will need to provide a tractor operator for the contractor provided tractor. The feeding contractor, the hay contractor, and the BLM COR shall coordinate all delivery times to ensure that hay is delivered and unloaded in a timely and efficient manner. The safety and well-being of the Contractor's personnel performing these feeding services shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. The behavior/conduct of the Contractor's personnel shall be the full responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall be held accountable for any employee's misconduct, negligence, and/or failure to perform. The Contractor's personnel shall have a working knowledge of feeding large numbers of animals in a feedlot environment. In the event that any one or more contractor personnel are observed performing the required duties in an unsafe manner to the animals, themselves, Government personnel, or endangering the Government Furnished equipment/supplies, the contractor shall be so notified by the COR or PI and the contractor shall provide an immediate replacement person at the facility within two hours of being notified. In as much as the facility is open to the public, the Contractor's employees will perform their duties in a manner that will not bring discredit on the BLM or the contractor.  Further, operation of equipment will take into consideration that members of the public may be in the area and utmost caution will be taken. The Contractor and personnel are responsible for any malicious damage or accidental damage of the Government furnished equipment. On a daily basis, prior to operating any item of equipment, the contractor's personnel will perform an inspection of the vehicles/equipment to include but not be limited to fluid levels, operation of safety equipment, etc. This is not a complete list of the specifications and should be used only as a basis to decide whether or not to review the solicitation. Proposals are due March 29, 2006 by 2:00 PM Mountain Time.  Send proposals by U.S. Mail to:  Department of the Interior; BLM, BC-663; Attention: Steve Santoro; BLDG 50, DFC, PO Box 25047; Denver, CO  80225-0047.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for one (1) job with an estimated total of forty (40) flight hours over a three week period, weather permitting for Airborne Science Support for an A-200 turbo prop aircraft to fly a remote sensing mission carrying the Raman Airborne Spectroscopic Lidar (RASL) instrument.  The integration and flights are scheduled for late June through August 2006. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the service from Dynamic Aviation Group Inc., of Bridgewater, VA.  Market research was conducted and it was determined that Dynamic Aviation is the only known commercial vendor with the required port modifications for the mounting of the payload and the desired aircraft class.  The mounting requirements for the mission instrumentation are a single open port measuring 23 x 26 inches.  The payload for this mission requires at least 300 amps @ 28 VDC and capable of carrying in excess of 1400 pounds of payload.  Although it would be possible to modify another aircraft to meet this need, it would not be possible to accomplish it within the time needed to coincide with the Aura satellite validation efforts, which is a critical requirement of this mission.  THE AUTHORITY FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IS FOUND IN 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2). The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 1, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the renewal of a software license from ABAQUS South Central, Inc. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ABAQUS South Central, Inc. on a sole source basis due to their product being proprietary, and not available from any other source. ABAQUS possessess the unique qualifications to provide the software and support.  According to technical experts no other software has the extensive capabilities ABAQUS has for performing highly nonlinear finite element analyses necessary to support the structural analysis of flight hardware.  ABAQUS Software is presently being used onsite at Marshall Space Flight Center, therefore compatibility is essential. Market Research determined that ABAQUS Software is the only software that can meet the required specifications.  The ABAQUS Software Lease renewal is necessary and urgent to support Space Shuttle Return to Flight efforts.  Specifically the efforts to study the External Tank Thermal Protection System and to minimize the schedule impact to programs at the Marshall Space Flight Center.  The current lease expires February 28, 2006 and failure to expediently renew this lease will be very detrimental to analysis capabilities and result in cost impacts and schedule delays for structural analysis. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact, Sheila Kirkland at sheila.kirkland@nasa.gov, no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Feb. 25, 2006 CST.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with I. Levy & Associates., 645 Maryville Centre Drive, suite 200, St. Louis, MO 63141-5815 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development and implementation of the Electronic Folder Interface (EFI)/Document Management Architecture (DMA) software into 30 Levy supported DDSs.  The period of performance for this award will begin on 3/22/06 and continue through 9/21/06.  Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs. These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs. I. Levy & Associates (ILA) developed and implemented the DDSs Disability Determination Case Processing System which is the legacy system used by each ILA supported state to process disability claims. ILA is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state. ILA has supported 30 DDSs for up to 20 years. ILA has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs. ILA owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve. The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objec!ives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder. The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases. To support the next and subsequent releases, modifications will be needed to the EFI/DMA and its supporting processes to enhance additional case processing. Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and JAVA applications utilizing the AS400 platform, process WebSphere Messaging Queues transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframe. The software must be 100% compatible with SSA’s current infrastructure. The Electronic Folder Interface (EFI) software must have the following conspicuous characteristics: The software must minimize modifications to the Electronic folder interface as well as the DDS legacy system application code when SSA changes the Electronic Folder’s data elements/requirements. The software must ensure user interfaces and screen presentations that exist in the DDS systems are preserved to the greatest extent possible when interfacing with eDib.  In addition, I. Levy & Associates will be required to provide for continued transition to a new electronic disability process to improve the efficiency, timeliness, accuracy and integrity of our disability determination process for the improved disability decision making.  Based on proposed amendments to our administrative review process for Social Security Administration claims based on disability, SSA requires the flexibility to provide for changes necessary.  Vendors authorized and capable of continuing SSA’s EFI development and implementation must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of business on March 1, 2006 and refer to DDS-ILEVY-EXTENSION.  Oral communication is not acceptable.  All submissions of information should be made to: Angie Landis, Contract Specialist/SSA, at the email address or mailing address accompanying this notice.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with Versa Management Systems, Inc., 110 North Kenilworth Avenue-7A, Oak Park, Illinois 60304 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “ Only one responsible source and no other source will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development and implementation of the Electronic Folder (EF) generic interface and Document Management Architecture (DMA) interface for a disability system operating in a DDS using licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems, Inc (Versa) into 17 supported Versa DDSs.  The period of performance for this award will begin on 3/23/06 and continue through 9/22/06.  Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs. These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs. SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program. Versa developed and implemented the DDSs Case Processing System changes by utilizing COBOL, JAVA and XML languages on an AS/400 platform. In addition Versa has worked with the current SSA infrastructure, which consists of IWS/LAN, WebSphere Messaging Queues, IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes. Versa is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state. Versa has provided some form of DDS support for 18 years and has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs. Versa owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve.  The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise. One of the major objec!ives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder. The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases. To support the next and any subsequent releases of eDib, modifications will be needed to the Versa EFI/DMA interface software and its supporting processes. The modifications will allow the DDS software systems to receive additional data elements from SSA’s Electronic Folder. The new data from SSA will provide additional case processing and update capabilities required to process disability cases after initial establishment. These modifications must be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional Versa states. The modifications must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems. Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and JAVA applications utilizing the AS400 platform, process WebSphere Messaging Queues transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframes.  In addition, Versa will be required to provide for continued transition to a new electronic disability process to improve the efficiency, timeliness, accuracy and integrity of our disability determination process for the improved disability decision making.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Division of Marine Fisheries, for services to continue conducting an industry based survey of Atlantic cod distribution for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The statutory authority for this proposed contract action is 41. U.S.C 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is uniquely qualified to continue performance based on their research protocols and personnel expertise.  The Commonwealth has been charged with the management of marine resources within the coastal waters in the Gulf of Maine and Southern New England and has been performing industry based survey services for two years under a pilot program established in the year 2003.  This pilot program was established based on Congressional interest and funding for the development and implementation of partnerships in cooperative research with the commercial fishing industry, conservation organizations and state Marine Fisheries agencies.  The goals of the survey are to (1) provide data that describes cod distribution and demographics in the Gulf of Maine; and (2) to assess the performance of rolling closure used as a management measure in the Northeast region.  The data collected are used by NMFS to develop evolving Groundfish Fisheries Management Plans (FMP).  This proposed acquisition is for the third and final year of the pilot survey.  Surveys conducted under this proposed contract action will continue the monitoring of the fine-scale distribution and population demographics of Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).  The scope of work includes standardized fish sampling protocol during p to five (5) survey cruises.  Each survey consists of ten (10) day cruises, using four commercial fishing vessels.  Each vessel performs 30 minute sampling tows at predetermined  sampling stations, for an average of five tows per day.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide written evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by March 1, 2006.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract action is based upon written responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered note 22 applies.

         Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board in Phase 1will be 
         issued a  formal solicitation (RFP) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  
 The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation.  Due to this time constraint it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design/build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design/build award will be paid $10,000 for each responsive technically acceptable project proposal and which is determined as being with the competitive range submitted in Phase Two.

PRIOR PRE-QUAILFICATION

Firms that submitted a Pre-qualification package for design/build projects of similar scope and value during FY 2005 or FY 2006 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit their pre-qualification package under this announcement. 


If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest prior to the closure date of this solicitation. However, if any changes have occurred in a company's structure, size status, or the Design/Build Team since the submission of the original design/build pre-qualification package the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. 

The government will determine if such changes are acceptable. Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is.

<DESC>TITLE REPORT SERVICES

IRS requires certified title reports for private and commercial real property (e.g., Lot Book, Chain of Title, Grant Deeds, etc.) as recorded, in the fifty-eight California Counties.  IRS does not require and is prohibited from the purchase of Title Insurance, but will require certification that the data and history provided on any report(s) ordered is complete and accurate.  

Individual reports will be ordered as required, for delivery of the report specified to the IRS within 10 days.  IRS currently orders 600-800 reports annually from Title Insurance providers within California.  A Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Award will be made to the small business contractor, or contractors, who demonstrate their ability to provide the required reports, at prices deemed to offer the best overall value to the Government.   Administratively, IRS desires the minimum number of small business providers that ensure coverage for all California counties; therefore multiple best-value awards may result, if a single contractor cannot provide full coverage at prices evaluated to offer the best overall value.

This is a restricted procurement, set aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code is 541191.     All responsible small business concerns are encouraged to submit a proposal(s).   Interested small business providers should contact the Contracting Officer for a copy of the request for quotation, which will be available on or after March 2, 2006.  NO telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.   Requests may be faxed to 415-848-4711 or e-mailed to jim.gensler@irs.gov.   Requests should include the name of the company, address, point of contact: name, telephone number and e-mail address, and the DUNS number.  NOTE:   Awards can only be issued to a contractor with an active registration in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov.     This registration must be active no later than the due date of the quotes to be eligible for award.     For registration assistance, please call 1-888-227-2423.  See Numbered Notes 1 and 25.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required.

<RESPDATE>051506
<ARCHDATE>07142006
<CONTACT>debra a matthews, 919-549-4385
<DESC>The U.S. Army has made a significant investment in basic research in High Performance Computing (HPC) and its application as well as the infrastructure to support such research.  This was underscored by the establishment, in 1989, and the continued s ustainment thereafter of the Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC), hereinafter called the Center.  Armys investments in HPC have resulted in the increasing utilization of computer based modeling and simulation by the Army scientific an d engineering community.  These investments have also created a steady source of well-trained scientists and engineers in this critical area.  The establishment of the Center and the continuation of the AHPCRC Program was and shall continue to be the embod iment of the Army's support of the broader national effort to maintain U.S. leadership in computing technology and its application to issues critical to U.S. national security. While other HPC related initiatives funded by other agencies exist (i.e. the Na tional Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy, and other U.S. Department of Defense organizations), this Center is committed to insuring that the needs relevant to Army problems, in particular, are properly developed in predictable directions, witho ut waiting for initiatives which may be primarily driven by commercial or other federal or Defense needs.  Through the AHPCRC Program, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) helps to stimulate and support the public purpose of furthering science in HPC an d also helps fulfill the research and development goals of the Department of Army.  More information about the current Center and AHPCRC Program can be found at http://www.ahpcrc.org. A key to the success of the AHPCRC Program is the collaborative research environment established between Government, Academia, and Industry.  Under this collaborative research environment, basic research is conducted in computational sciences and engineeri ng.  The research covers research areas related to computational sciences and engineering, to include interdisciplinary computational research (i.e. research involving more than one scientific discipline); Scalable Algorithms and Software Technology; and E nabling Technologies. The objective of the basic research efforts include conducting innovative computational research in collaboration with Army scientists to accelerate the infusion of new technologies in support of Army Transformation; provide for the m utual exchange of researchers between the Army and the AHPCRC to facilitate the execution of joint research projects including the exploitation of high performance computing; and provide on- and off-site symposia and educational programs to increase awaren ess of this partnership program, to foster scientific interchange, and to facilitate transition of new technologies emerging as a result of this program to Army laboratories and development centers.  Early access HPC systems are acquired, maintained and ex ploited for computational sciences research.  This involves installing, integrating, operating and maintaining presently owned Government Furnished Property (GFP) at several sites and identifying, acquiring, installing, integrating and operating new and/or  emerging HPC resources.  All of these support efforts must be conducted in coordination with the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO) concerning HPC systems.   The availability and use of these HPC resources is both integral and cri tical to support the research being performed under the AHPCRC Program.     The U. S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is hereby announcing its intention to issue a Program Announcement (PA) to solicit proposals to continue the AHPCRC Program.  Award will be made on the basis of the best value to the Government.  The Government anti cipates awarding one Cooperative Agreement (31 U.S.C. 6305) for the AHPCRC Program under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358 to fulfill the needs of the  AHPCRC Program.  In accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) that govern the use of Cooperative Agreements, Profit or Fee will be prohibited for the research efforts, i.e. all efforts that are substantive to performance of the AHP CRC program.  However, certain aspects of the support of the HPC resources described above may be considered goods and services needed to carry out the AHPCRC program; and thus the Recipient may be eligible to receive a profit or fee for those goods or ser vices.  The award is expected to provide for a basic performance period of five (5) years with one (1) optional five (5) year extension period, bringing the total performance period to a potential maximum of ten (10) years.  Interested Parties will be requ ired to form a Consortium in order to respond to the Program Announcement. While the Consortium can be incorporated as a legal entity, there is no requirement for the Consortium to do so.  The Consortium will be required to draft Articles of Collaboration that will address various internal operational aspects of the Consortium.  Proposals that do not include Articles of Collaboration signed by duly authorized representatives of each Consortium member will be considered non-responsive and the proposal will r eceive no further consideration for award. The Consortium must be capable of providing a research program over a five-year period with an option for an additional five-year period.  Minimum Consortium Membership requirements include a (1) a University Lead for Research; (2) a Lead for Support and Administration; and (3) a Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) Member. Other members (both educational an d industrial) may be added as necessary to meet the goals of the AHPCRC Program.   The University Lead for Research must be an accredited advanced degree (Ph. D.) granting U.S. educational institution noted for world-class research in interdisciplinary com putational sciences, algorithms and software development, and enabling technologies.  The University Lead for Research is responsible for leading all of the research efforts of the Consortium, and managing transition, outreach and educational opportunities .  It is envisioned (but not required) that the Lead for Support and Administration be an industrial concern.   The Lead for Support and Administration is responsible for acquiring, installing, operating, and managing HPC systems and housing a significant amount of the existing HPC resources.  They may also be involved in outreach and educational opportunities, as well as transitioning of the research results to Army scientists, and thus, the Lead for Support and Administration will be required to have Secr et facility clearance.  Further, the Lead for Support and Administration will be responsible for distributing the funding to the Consortium members based on the currently approved Program Plan of effort to be conducted under the cooperative agreement betwe en the Army and the Consortium.  In addition, Lead for Support and Administration will be responsible for monitoring and processing disbursements through the Army.   Funding levels for the resultant Cooperative Agreement are subject to the availability of funds.  Three types of funding are expected to be provided for under the Cooperative Agreement, i.e. funding for basic research efforts, funding for technology transi tion, educational opportunities, outreach and support of the HPC systems described above; and funding for the acquisition of new HPC resources.  Two levels of funding are identified for this program, based on current budget submissions and supplemental fun ding that historically has been received for this program.  Based on budget submissions, research efforts would be funded at estimated value of $2,000,000.00 per year, and efforts to operate and support the existing HPC resources of the program would be fu nded at an estimated value of $1,000,000.00 per year, over the  potential ten year period of performance, with no budgeted Army procurement funding.  However, based on supplemental funding that has been historically received for the program, funding above the budget submission values described above is possible.  Addi tional funding for support of the HPC resources, technology transition, educational and outreach efforts, and management of the research program and the research partners is estimated at $15,000,000.00 per year, over the potential ten year period of perfor mance.  With respect to supplemental funding that historically has been received for acquiring new HPC resources, the estimated total value is $30,0000,000.00 for the basic period of performance of five years, and $30,000,000.00 for the optional additional  five-year period of performance.  Proposals submitted in response to the PA are expected to be provided at both funding levels listed above.   The Government expects the funding levels to fluctuate over the period of performance and envisions adjusting th e program goals to coincide with these fluctuations.  The Government will assess the progress of the research effort yearly. Exercise of the five-year option will be based on a comprehensive review of technical performance, the availability of funds and Ar my needs.   The complete PA will be posted on the ARL web site http://www.arl.army.mil/main/Main/default.cfm?Action=6&Page=8 on or about 15 March 2006.   A Pre-Proposal Conference is expected to be held in early April 2006, at the current AHPCRC facility in Minneapolis, MN.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide an opportunity to potential Offerors to interchange with the Government concerning the AH PCRC Program, and also provide potential Offerors with an opportunity to view the existing HPC resources.  Details concerning the date, time and location of this Conference will be published in a subsequent announcement.

Part I.		DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK
	Statement of Work
Life-Cycle Management of Iraqi Security Forces Communications Project
DRAFT
1.	GENERAL: 

1.1.	 Introduction: A robust, reliable, interconnected telecommunications infrastructure is essential to Iraq’s ongoing national economic recovery and development. The U.S. Government (USG), in association with Coalition Force (CF) partners, the Government of Iraq (GOI), and other non-government organizations, has committed funds for several projects to improve telecommunications infrastructure within specific geographic regions (e.g., Baghdad) and within certain functional areas (e.g., Iraqi security forces).  With immediacy often being the most pressing criteria for these varied projects, particularly as it applies to enabling a stronger security posture in Iraq, interconnectivity was often overlooked, resulting in a series of stovepipes that, if linked by a common architecture, could likely offer more capacity than the sum of their parts.  In order to prioritize future efforts and maximize availability of current capability, a study of the telecommunications infrastructure within Iraq is necessary, with particular focus on its ability to support command and control (C2) of Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).  The project has three distinct components: 1) Determine the status of the telecommunications infrastructure within Iraq (referred to as the “As-Is Systems View” [ASV]); 2) document/depict the means by which the GOI leverages the present and planned telecommunications infrastructure to provide C2 of ISF within an Iraqi concept of operations (CONOPS), and;  3) Analyze ISF C2 telecommunications networks, specifically addressing how these networks can take advantage of the infrastructure in its current state and proposing measures that can enhance overall telecommunications services that accommodate ISF C2.  As stated, the primary focus of all three components is to identify the means to improve C2 of ISF, with recognition that in order to do so, situational awareness of all available infrastructure will be necessary.

1.2.	Problem Statement: To achieve congruence in ongoing efforts to establish robust, reliable, interconnected telecommunications services for government, industry, and citizenry, with an immediate eye toward establishing a documented ISF C2 network, all stakeholders need to be aware of the present state of Iraq’s telecommunications infrastructure.  This project will yield: current status of the Iraqi telecommunications infrastructure, to include fiber optic cable and all interconnecting media; documentation of the present and planned telecommunications means by which the GOI executes C2 of ISF; and analysis with recommendations to enhance existing telecommunication infrastructure and the ISF C2 networks and services that rely upon it. 

1.3.	Definition:  Iraqi Security Forces include all police personnel under the command and control of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and all military personnel under the command and control of the Ministry of Defense (MOD), to include Iraqi military forces which presently remain under operational and/or tactical control of Coalition Forces prior to battlespace transition.  It is important for the contractor to be aware that effective C2 of ISF will require connectivity to entities outside both MOI and MOD, to include but not limited to the Prime Minister’s Situation Room, National Joint Operations Center, Provincial Joint Coordination Centers, and emergency service providers, e.g., fire departments and ambulance services.

2.	SCOPE:  This SOW will encompass the entire country of Iraq.    

2.1.	Qualifications:  The contractor shall provide resumes highlighting the skill levels of contractor team members, to include subcontractors and vendors.  Resumes will outline experience in telecommunications and regulatory environments.  The contractor will also provide references and examples of demonstrated performance in telecommunications survey and enterprise network architecture analysis and optimization, specifically highlighting any experience in national telecommunication development and reconstruction efforts.  Upon award of contract, the USG will retain the authority to approve/refuse any changes to the contractor team, to include subcontractors and vendors.     

2.2.	Methodology:  The contractor will propose a strategy (or strategies) for providing interim deliverables, to be approved by the USG, tied to the proposed project phasing of work..  Examples are (1) geographically by province (i.e., infrastructure within Babil, Diyala, etc.); (2) operationally by function (portions that support core services, etc.); (3) geographically by key locations (from major cities out to less populated areas, from Forward Operating Bases out, etc.).  Since the likely final disposition of all deliverables will be with the GOI (as released by the USG), all final products will be produced in both English and Arabic and usable on  automated data processing equipment and software available or compatible to both nations.  All products will be delivered directly to the USG without exception.  

2.2.1.	Telecommunications Infrastructure As-Is Systems View (ASV):  The contractor must obtain and present detailed records for portions of the ASV that may become a source for portions of the final product at the discretion of the USG.  The contractor will perform on-site surveys, to include path walks, for undocumented infrastructure paths/sites, and for paths/sites for which obtained records are deemed unsatisfactory by the USG.  The contractor will re-visit sites/paths as required if status is suspected of changing during the course of the study.  In all cases above, the contractor will document the nature of any capability gaps or service outages..  

2.2.2.	ISF C2 Communications CONOPs:  The contractor will propose a means to develop a depiction/description of the means by which the GOI leverages the present and planned telecommunications infrastructure to provide C2 of ISF, with understanding that the intent is to include input from GOI and Coalition Force staff.   The contractor will also propose the format by which this CONOPS will be produced.  

2.2.3.	Analysis of/Recommendations for Life-cycle Management Processes for ISF C2 Networks:  The contractor will propose a means by which prioritized recommendations for enhancement of the national telecommunications infrastructure will be developed, with particular emphasis on ISF C2 networks.  The contractor will also propose the format by which this analysis will be produced.

3.	DELIVERABLES:  The contractor shall provide the following, none of which will be copy protected, all of which will be produced in English and Arabic, and all of which will become property of the USG:

3.1.	Telecommunications Infrastructure ASV:  a comprehensive survey to include map(s) and underlying data describing existing and planned telecommunications infrastructure within Iraq in a data format compatible with common industry standards.  Map(s) will incorporate: all fiber and interconnecting media with color coding to indicate manufacturer, specifications (to include strand count), capacity, operational status (lit, dark, level of activity), description of type and status of conduit where deployed, identification of areas where conduit is not deployed, distances between key landmarks, and ownership; identification of manhole/hand-hole locations and other key transport landmarks and capacity (i.e., exchanges, microwave or satellite dishes); and, for purposes of reference, major roadways, cities; national landmarks; and other national infrastructure reliant upon the telecommunications infrastructure, to include but not limited to the electrical grid.  Key locations (manholes/handholes, cable plant, power plant, equipment rooms, junctions of connecting media other than fiber, major faults) will be photographed and identified by GPS coordinates.  The adequacy of data will be determined by the USG.

3.2.	ISF C2 Communications CONOPs:  documents to assist GOI with employment of planned and delivered communications capabilities for C2 of ISF, to include an information management capability for use by GOI for storing, coordinating, and updating the documents.  

3.3.	Analysis/Recommendations:  analysis and recommendations for enhancing existing telecommunications infrastructure and national telecommunications networks, particularly ISF C2 networks,, specifically addressing how these networks can take advantage of the infrastructure in its current state and proposed measures that will provide for enhanced services.  The contractor will specifically examine public telephone switching networks, internet service provider networks, wireless broadband networks, government private networks, “last-mile” access networks, and global system for mobile communications (GSM) networks.  Proposal will identify capability shortfalls and gaps and propose a way-ahead in order of priority.

3.4.	Reports/ Plans: The contractor will provide a proposal for periodicity and format for reports on status of deliverables.  The contractor will provide written and oral status reports to the USG and stakeholders (to be determined by the USG) on a schedule of no less than once a week, or as deemed necessary by the USG.  Out-briefs will conclude each proposed work phase of the project to ensure agreement that the intent of the phase is met to the USG’s satisfaction.  At the conclusion of the project, the contractor will provide a comprehensive report which contains all deliverables.  All reports, plans, and correspondence (meeting minutes, etc.), will be made available in both English and Arabic.  The contractor will also provide an Arabic translator for all meetings and presentations at which non-English speaking GOI personnel are present.

Part II.	STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
	Statement of Objectives --  Life-Cycle Management of Iraqi Security Forces Communications Project 

Overarching Objective and Desired Outcomes

1.0  Several communications capabilities have been, and are being, delivered and fielded to the Iraqis to support Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).  In keeping with continued focus on Iraqi self-sufficiency and the steady building of capacity, this effort will focus on those enduring elements central to Iraqi long-term operations, ownership and life-cycle planning for their delivered and operational communications capabilities.   The three enduring, interconnected elements for this effort are:  1) an integrated picture of KEY communications capabilities;  2)  documenting and evolving the concepts of operations (CONOPs) for employing these capabilities, and;  3)  developing a priority-setting framework for life-cycle management of communications capabilities – to evolve the integrated communications picture in the context of documented/evolving CONOPs.

	1.1  This effort will focus on the products (deliverables) and the processes necessary to shape and evolve communications ownership and planning for the ISF – from an operations perspective.  As such, this effort will be executed in partnership with the ISF leadership (Ministries of Defense and Interior (MoD, MoI); Joint Headquarters (JHQ); Iraqi Ground Forces Command (IGFC)) from the very start.  Key USG players are MNF-I CIS (overall MNF lead), MNC-I, MNSTC-I, and American Embassy (Baghdad).

Specific Objectives & Deliverables (all deliverables and work products will be in Arabic & English)

2.0   Building an integrated picture of planned/delivered communications capabilities.  The deliverable should document and describe the “as is” communications systems, networks and infrastructure.  
2.1  The deliverable (referred to as the “as-is systems view” or ASV) should be in a computer-based format that can be delivered to, and easily managed by, the Iraqis.   
2.2  While the ASV is focused on Security Forces communications capabilities, it must also document and portray all other communications capabilities related to, and/or relied upon by, ISF communications capabilities.
2.3  Using the ASV, identify gaps and potential improvement areas (training, support, upgrades, etc) and relate these recommendations to documented/established ISF CONOPs for employing communications capabilities.

3.0	Documenting CONOPs for ISF Use of Delivered Communications Capabilities.  The
deliverable(s) will be all the ISF CONOPs for employing planned and delivered communications capabilities
	3.1  Facilitate the coordination and writing of CONOPs documents, by ISF staffs, for ISF communications capabilities. 
	3.2  Develop and deliver an info management capability, for use by the Iraqis, for storing, coordinating, and updating documented ISF CONOPs.

4.0   Life-cycle Management Processes for Delivered Communications Capabilities.  This effort will focus on the process for setting priorities related to ISF communications capabilities.  The deliverable will be the implementation of a priority setting framework (deliverables as well as meetings & coordination processes) based on the ASV (para 2.0 above) AND as influenced by changes stemming from the CONOPs documentation process (para 3.0 above).

4.1  Place initial emphasis on those capabilities priorities that DIRECTLY support ISF transition and operational success.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. National Marine Fisheries Service, (NMFS) located in Juneau, Ak.

The period of performance for this contract is from March 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007


The objective of the Sablefish Logbook Program is to collect catch and effort information from sablefish longline fishery vessels.  This request is for a contract to provide services to the Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL) for dockside logbook collection, data entry and verification, database maintenance and database output and reports.

The stock assessment of Alaska sablefish is closely scrutinized because of the high value of the fishery, ex vessel value over $ 100 million, and because IFQ management gives some quasi-property value to fishermen.  The current sablefish stock assessment is based on fisheries-independent data collected from annual longline surveys since 1979, fisheries data collected by observers since 1990, voluntary logbooks since 1997, and required logbooks since 1999.  Detailed fishery data are collected so that the sablefish stock assessment is based on observational data rather than assumptions about fishery characteristics. The observer data covers about 15% of the catch by weight.  The logbook program broadens coverage to about 30% of the catch.  

The Sablefish Logbook Program was instigated by sablefish fishermen's desire for NMFS to consider more fishery based information in the sablefish stock assessment.  Incorporation of more fishery data into the sablefish assessment also has been promoted by the Scientific and Statistical Committee of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The sablefish stock assessment will be more credible if these data are collected and analyzed by NMFS in assessing sablefish abundance. If these data are not collected and analyzed, the fishing industry likely will increase pressure on quota recommendations, possibly to the long term detriment of the sablefish population.

Since 1999, the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) has had a contract with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL) to collect sablefish log sheets from skippers with vessels 60 feet and over, landing in the ports where IPHC samplers are located. Prior to IPHC involvement, there was a voluntary program funded by the fleet to provide CPUE data to the ABL sablefish scientists. The current project was initiated at the request of sablefish skippers, who worked with both agencies on the implementation. The initial agreement had IPHC samplers collecting the IFQ distribution log sheets from the NMFS Catcher Vessel DFL Groundfish/IFQ longline and pot gear logbooks for sablefish landings. If sablefish was the only species sold, the signed green (IFQ distribution) sheets were forwarded.  If there were halibut and sablefish landed, photocopies of the signed sheets were forwarded to ABL. All log sheets sent to NMFS ABL had a skipper's signature acknowledging and agreeing to the following: 'IPHC will forward to Sablefish Assessment, Auke Bay Lab'

Logbook Collection

The IPHC will collect detailed fishery information on sablefish catch and fishing effort from NMFS logbooks required by quota share vessels and encountered by IPHC port samplers.  Additionally, when available, IPHC will collect sablefish information from vessels with available sablefish catch in voluntary logbooks. These logs will be collected by IPHC port samplers at the landing location from the following ports:


Bellingham, WA	
Petersburg, AK	
St. Paul, AK

Sitka, AK	
Seward, AK	
Homer, AK

Kodiak, AK	
Dutch Harbor, AK (May 16 - Nov 15)	
Juneau, AK
In both cases, port samplers will collect data and interview skippers to complete any missing information, review the data, and ensure gear information is accurate. Additionally, port samplers will copy IFQ landed weights of sablefish onto the logs from processing plant information.

Data Entry and Verification

Log sheets collected by the port samplers shall be submitted for data entry and verification each year.  The estimated number of required logbook sets per year is 3800 based on 2004. The estimated number of voluntary logs is between 100-200 per year representing about 1,000 sets, based on 2002-2003. 

All information necessary to determine CPUE by set contained in the logbooks must be keyed and verified.  This includes all gear data, fishing information by set if sablefish is caught or targeted (fishing date, location, depth, skate information, sablefish numbers or weight, target species as noted on log), landed weight of sablefish. The Contractor will use internal verification procedures to ensure an accurate electronic record of the logbook data.  The logbook data shall be double-keyed, accounting for any differences.  The 
standard is 100% match between the paper logbook record and the electronic database.

IFQ landing information will be matched to the logbooks. The IPHC will match the trip recorded in the logbook to the trip recorded in the IFQ landing reports. Additionally, IFQ landing information will be collected by IPHC port samplers and will be recorded on the logbook when logbooks are collected. At the end of the fishing season, all IFQ landing reports will be checked to verify that no matches of IFQ landing reports to logbooks were missed. 

Database Confidentiality

The IPHC shall do the following to ensure that the data remains confidential:

1)	The IPHC will provide ABL scientists sablefish data from log sheets that include the captain's signature acknowledging that the information would be provided to ABL.

2)	The log data will be provided with a unique vessel identifier to protect the confidentiality of the vessel. The vessel identifier will be consistent for all landings by a given vessel so that a given vessel may be tracked over time.  The data provided will be set specific and include target species as identified by skipper, fishing location (latitude/longitude), date, and effort information from sets involving any sablefish retention or target.  The landing site or date will not be provided.

3)	The IPHC will provide NMFS ABL staff using the data with a confidentiality agreement that will be signed by both parties.  Under this agreement NMFS ABL staff will agree not to release individual vessel log book data to the public, agencies, Councils, or anyone outside the ABL.  Any published or released data will be summarized by larger geographic regions and for three or more vessels, so that confidentiality of voluntary information is not sacrificed.

<DESC>MATERIAL SYSTEMS FOR AUTONOMOUS STRUCTURAL TAILORING (MAST) SOL BAA 06-19, Addendum 1, DUE:  05/15/06.  TECHNICAL POC:  Dr. Donald J. Leo, DARPA/DSO, Ph:  (571) 218-4939, Email:  baa06-19@darpa.mil; URL:  www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/

Description

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) seeks innovative concept proposals for the development of material systems that utilize circulation to enable autonomous change in intrinsic properties. For our purposes circulation is defined as controlled transport of fluid or gas within the structural material. The properties of transport medium could be varied (e.g., with external stimuli) to modify the properties of the material system. The goal is to demonstrate either 1) material systems that exhibit a change of an order of magnitude or more in mechanical, electromagnetic, or thermal properties through circulation, or 2) material systems that utilize circulation to exhibit properties not currently possible in structural material systems, such as surface regeneration, self-repair, or completely reconfigurable electrical or thermal properties. The key elements of the technical effort are 1) demonstrating the ability to incorporate a circulatory network into a structural material without severely compromising structural integrity, 2) demonstrating the ability to reversibly control electrical, thermal, or mechanical properties, and 3) quantifying the magnitude of the property change and response time of the property change in a representative structural material. 

This request is for proposals of not more than nine months in length that are focused exclusively on the elements described above. It is expected that the total funding will be at the level of one to two million and a total of three to six awards will be made. The success of these individual efforts will be a major factor in determining whether a DARPA program in this area is initiated. The government reserves the right to fund no proposals under this BAA addendum. 
 
Background

One of the ultimate goals of research in smart material systems is to create a material system that mimics the properties of biological systems. Biological systems exhibit an amazing capacity for extreme changes in material properties through adaptation, regeneration, self-repair, and stimulus responsive behavior. The development of structural material systems with the properties of adaptation, regeneration, and self-repair would certainly have tremendous impact on military systems, particularly for a new generation of unmanned and autonomous systems that require long persistence and multi-mission capability. 

In the past ten to fifteen years there have been important advances in the development of biologically-inspired systems that combine adaptive, or smart, materials for sensing and actuation with processing electronics for real-time control. Transducer materials such as piezoelectric ceramics and polymers, shape memory materials, and fiber optics have been integrated into structural materials for the purpose of providing the nerves and muscles of the system, while advances in microprocessors and digital signal processing have enabled the incorporation of the brains of the system. Material systems that utilize this paradigm for biological-inspiration have advanced the fields of noise control, vibration suppression, and motion control, resulting in large-scale tests for control of flight surfaces and the reduction of noise and vibration in aircraft.

Unfortunately the paradigm of combining transducer materials with control electronics has provided only limited success in developing structural material systems with the adaptation, regeneration, and self-repair functions that mimic biological systems. For example, there has been success in the development of composite materials that change their mechanical properties in response to an applied field, but the changes are limited by the coupling properties of the transducer material integrated within the composite. Larger variations are possible with materials such as polymer materials, but the range of elastic properties achievable with polymer materials often precludes their use in load-bearing structures. Similar situations have occurred for material systems that change other constitutive properties such as dielectric permittivity, conductivity, or permeability. 

The premise of this call for proposals is that circulation is a key component to achieving biologically-inspired functionality and that component is missing from the current paradigm for the development of biologically-inspired structural material systems. It is well known that all multi-cellular organisms incorporate a circulatory system whose primary function is to carry nutrients to cells and waste away from cells. In addition to these primary functions, circulation in biological systems plays a key role in wound healing, metabolic control, and thermal management. All of these functions are enabled by the transport of fluid and the existence of localized chemical activity, and many of the functions enabled by circulation are truly autonomous since the control is triggered by localized chemical changes. 

The goal of this program is to develop structural material systems that incorporate circulation as a means of autonomous control of intrinsic properties. DARPA seeks to investigate means of using circulation to induce extreme changes in system properties or to use circulation as a means of introducing revolutionary new capabilities into structural material systems. Examples of extreme changes in material properties include, but are not limited to, order of magnitude changes in elastic modulus in ranges that are useful for load-bearing structures, order of magnitude changes in relative dielectric permittivity, conductivity, or magnetic permeability in ranges that are useful for tailoring the structural surface properties, and order of magnitude changes in thermal conductivity; examples of revolutionary new capabilities include, but are not limited to, regeneration of protective coatings for combating structural erosion, self-repair of structural materials to eliminate catastrophic defects, and conductive pathways that are completely configurable for the purpose of changing the electrical properties of surfaces.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While is it understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Amendment 0001 to synopsis N00178-06-R-4000  is issued to replace the previous synopsis.  Below is the complete amended synopsis in its entirety.   The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Navy Virtual SYSCOM (partners NAVSUP, NAVAIR, SPAWAR and NAVFAC) and other Navy activities, is conducting a rolling admission per the terms and conditions of the SeaPort Enhanced (Seaport e) Multiple Award Contracts.  The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (I!  D/IQ) prime contracts.  Existing prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for awards in those zones.  The NAICS size standard for Small Business is $25 Million. Current Seaport e contracts have the following characteristics: (1) Award was made on a Best Value Evaluation, (2) ID/IQ contracts with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee(CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), and Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Task Orders.  No T&M orders are allowed.  (3) Requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices. (4) Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders.  (5) Goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors. (6) Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.  (7) One award as a Prime Contractor is allowed to individual companies; however a contr!  actor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes. (8) There are seven g eographic zones – Northeast; National Capital; Mid-Atlantic; Gulf Coast; Midwest; Pacific Northwest; and Southwest. (9) Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principal place of performance.  (10) Limits on pass-through, maximum fees, annual escalation, and cost savings are required.  Awards made during the rolling admissions process will have the same or similar characteristics. Oral proposals are not contemplated.  Awards are intended to be made on initial offer without discussions.  The Government desires an increase in small business, hubzone, WOSB, SDVOSB, and 8(a) participation.  Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.  Prospective offerors are advised that firms certified under small business sub-categories that are competing for inclusion within the Seaport e Program via Rolling Admissions will be competing only against other prospective offerors certified within their respective small business sub-category. Information con!  cerning this rolling admission is available on the Seaport homepage at www.seaport.navy.mil.  Copies of the original solicitation (N00178-04-R-4000), the previous Rolling Admissions solicitation (N00178-05-R-4000), the original Rolling Admissions Industry Brief (dated November 2004), and the questions and answers to the previous solicitations can currently be found on the homepage.  The solicitation number is N00178-06-R-4000.  The anticipated release date for the solicitation is 24 February 2006.  The target date for the Rolling Admissions awards is June 2006.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Seaport site for the release of the solicitation, amendments, and supporting information.

<DESC>************ PLEASE NOTE:   This is a modification to Space Warfare Center (SWC) "Open" Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01.   “Call" SWC BAA 04-04 makes minor changes to existing focus areas and other clerical changes but does not create additional focus areas.  Calls may be issued against SWC BAA 04-01 for a period of no more than five years from the date of its initial announcement and will be executed an an annual basis.  White papers for SWC BAA 04-04 may be submitted from the date of this announcement through 20 Feb 07.  All terms and conditions of the previous announcement for SWC BAA 04-03 remain valid.  A complete description of SWC BAA 04-04 is identified in the attached document.  The SWC may contract for activities covered in the focus areas detailed within this document.  The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SWC to meet current and future Air Force warfighter space needs.  The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for the warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner.  White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities for potential 3600 R&D acquisitions or leverage off existing capabilities for 3400 O&M acquisitions.  Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.  After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  However, should potential white papers be accepted from those institutions, and adequate funding become available, proposals will be requested from them.  Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at (719) 567-3565 or Ms. Brenda Lewis at (719) 567-3440.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.     Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Mr. Dennis Love, AAC/XP, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-0312.     Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N02-CP-61006-49
<RESPDATE>022806
<ARCHDATE>03152006
<CONTACT>Sharon Miller, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-3783, Fax (301) 480-0241, Email sm103r@nih.gov
<DESC>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, is conducting market research to determine the availability of health research organizations able to provide comprehensive, detailed, and systematic computerized data on pediatric computerized tomography (CT) examinations that can be linked to population-based cancer registries so that a large study can be conducted to examine potential risks for cancer.  This announcement is for informational purposes only to determine if competition is feasible.  

Since the introduction of CT scans in medicine in the early 1970s, their use has increased rapidly in Western societies. With increasing use of this indispensable, sometimes life-saving technology, the relatively high radiation doses received by patients has focused attention on the potential risk for developing radiation-related cancers. Children are of particular concern because they are more sensitive to the deleterious effects of radiation, generally receive higher effective doses, often undergo repeat or unnecessary scans, sometimes with sub-optimal machine settings, and have a longer expected lifetime to express risk for radiation-induced cancers. 

Due to the relatively recent widespread introduction of CT scans into common clinical practice, the considerable latency period between radiation exposure and the development of cancers, and the large number of exposed patients required, the potential adverse health effects of CT scan exposure have not yet been studied directly. Therefore, the DCEG is planning to conduct large cohort and nested case-control studies to directly quantify the cancer risks associated with exposure to CT scans at a young age.

The offeror is expected to be a part of a health research organization that has extensive experience in large-scale epidemiologic studies, preferably in the areas of cancer etiology and radiation effects.  The offeror must be able to:

1) Collect accurate, systematic, and comprehensive computerized patient data of at least 200,000 children (under age 15 years) who received CT scans between 1985 and 2000. It is anticipated that patient data include all of the following: name, unique identifying number that allows computer linkage with other patient and health registries, age (or weight) at examination, gender, type of CT scan (e.g., axial or helical, pitch), body location of scan (e.g. brain or abdomen), the type of CT scanner used, exposure setting used (i.e. milliamp-second setting), scanner voltage used (kVp), and referring clinical department or medical indication for the scan.  

2) Computer link the patient database to nation-wide population registries so that vital status can be determined for study subjects from 1985-2006.

3) Computer link the patient database to high-quality population-based regional or nation-wide cancer registries for the period 1985-2006.  The registries must provide full coverage of the geographic areas from which the study patients were identified. 

4) Collect data in a country or region with a health system that provides equal access to care and where CT scans are almost always performed in large hospital radiology departments and are highly unlikely to have been performed in small private practices or clinics.

5) Obtain patient data, computer linkage, and analyses within a period of four years. Therefore, preference will be given to offerors who can show evidence of their ability to provide data in a timely fashion. 

Sources possessing the experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements must provide pertinent information in sufficient detail to reflect their ability to successfully accomplish the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed five (5) pages, and must also include previous or similar projects performed to allow NCI the ability to perform proper evaluation of the offeror’s capabilities.   

Interested offerors should furnish four (4) copies of the capability information addressing the requirements described above to the attention of Sharon Miller, Contracting Officer, NCI Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS/6112, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7196.  If a hand delivery/courier is used the address is the same except for the city and zip code (Rockville, MD 20852).  Capability information can also be faxed to #301/480-0241, or emailed to Sharon Miller at sm103r@nih.gov.  Electronic documents must be submitted either in Word Perfect or Word.  Questions can be directed to Sharon by email or by telephone at 301/435-3783, or to the Contract Specialist George Kennedy at 301/435-3779.    Proprietary information must be marked as such.  Information submitted will be held in a confidential manner.  This announcement is part of market research by the Agency to determine if a sole source award is justifiable.  Capability information must be received by 2:00 PM EST, February 28, 2006.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for a Mars Aerial Platform Scout Mission (Mars) - NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from all U.S. industries, academia, non-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and other government agencies to participate in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives for a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Mars Scout 2006 and Mission of Opportunity. Mars Scout missions are envisioned to be focused investigations of Martian biological, chemical and physical phenomena and processes. The Mars Scout mission opportunity was established to provide for innovative, rapid-response investigations. Mars Scout investigations are led by a Principal Investigator supported by Co-Investigators and an implementation team. These teams will pursue missions of high scientific value by utilizing observation platforms of their choice and design. The observation platform selected for use by the LaRC team is an aerial platform.   The Mars Scout AO is expected to be released in April 2006 with the step-1 proposal due 90 days later. Multiple complete mission proposals will be selected to proceed to step-2 (Phase A), with a single mission selected for implementation. A launch date in 2011 is planned.   This synopsis solicits science team partners (Co-Investigators) in the following four areas: (1) The geology of Mars with particular emphasis on surface evolution and surface features modified by wind, water, volcanism and impact processes; requires experience and expertise in analysis and interpretation of Mars geological data and in Mars mission planning and operations. (2) The geology of Mars with particular emphasis on the long-term evolution of surface and interior of Mars, including evidence of possible evidence of glaciation and surface liquid water; requires experience and expertise in analysis and interpretation of Mars geological data and in Mars mission planning and operations. (3) The geology of Mars with particular emphasis on high spatial resolution imagery of geological and terrain features and its interpretation in terms of regional-scale measurements; requires experience and expertise in analysis and interpretation of geological Mars data and in Mars mission planning and operations. (4) The chemistry of the atmosphere of Mars with particular emphasis on water-driven photochemical and chemical processes and surface-atmospheric coupling: requires knowledge, experience, expertise and application of photochemical models of the Mars atmosphere. It is noted that two previous teaming opportunities for the Mars Aerial Platform Scout Mission were issued on March 29, 2005 (SS-NNL05MARS) and January 18, 2006 (SS-NNL06MARSAerial), seeking partners in other mission areas. Both of these opportunities are closed. Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC. If selected through this synopsis, each partner is expected to become a full member of the science team and proposal development team. LaRC will require each selected partner to provide a letter of commitment in the submitted proposal.  Partners will be expected to participate in future science team meetings, develop strategic science objectives and evaluate mission science data.  LaRC anticipates issuing contracts, other agreements or grants to the selected science team members, provided the mission concept is selected for implementation.  Interested parties may propose as a partner for any, all, or any combination of the areas sought. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant science experience and past performance in similar activities and mission science teams.	Provide a description of relevant Mars planetary science experience including a summary of significant achievements and key publications. Each offeror shall specifically discuss the relevance of their experience in reference to the science areas described above.    (2) Cost and schedule control:	This criterion evaluates the offeror’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Technical Capability and Personnel: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s technical capability to perform the science duties, and the availability of the offeror to perform the duties.  The offeror shall describe the technical capability, availability and adequacy of key personnel for the proposal and the mission. NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  It is expected that the teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal process and that selection of the proposal for mission implementation would result in contracts, other agreements or grants for the selected partner(s). This teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contract, agreement or grant nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), science consultation, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA Scout guidelines as described in the AO.  Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages for each science area of interest (i. e., Offerors responding to one or more of the four areas may submit up to 5 pages per area). Responses shall address each of the aforementioned evaluation criteria. A cover page that clearly identifies the area of interest addressed by the response does not count towards the total allocated page count.  All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on March 2, 2006 to: Brian D. Killough at Email: Brian.D.Killough@larc.nasa.gov Science and Programmatic questions should be directed to: Dr. Joel S. Levine at (757)864-5692 or  e-mail: Joel.S.Levine@nasa.gov

<DESC>SEND RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE PM POC, JOE SCOTT, AT E-MAIL ADDRESS: SCOTTJOE@TACOM.ARMY.MIL AND BOB SCHULKINS AT E-MAIL ADDRESS: SCHULKIR@TACOM.ARMY.MIL.  REPLIES TO THIS QUESTIONNAIRE MUST BE RECEIVED BY 14 MAR 2006.    PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE LIGHTWEIGHT WATER PURIFIER (LWP) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Lightweight Water Purifier (LWP). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Produ ct Support Provider for the LWP. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness ; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance  (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of LWP systems.  Operator and maintenance training, (New Equipment Training (NET)) will be the prime (Original E quipment Manufacturer (OEM)) contractors responsibility.  The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, including recommendation and implementation of  configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 15 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the LWP System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance /repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the Army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: "	Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: "	Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: "	Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (Optempo) if available .  See Appendix B for a profile of the LWP System. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE LIGHTWEIGHT WATER PURIFIER (LWP) Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: 1.  Describe your companys experience, if any, in providing PBL support to Army vehicles or systems. 2.

If so, on which vehicles or systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating that with the current organic system? 5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipated within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, and providing relief from conducting sustainment training?  What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance? 8. How would your company manage a sustainment training program and reduce the Armys training burden?  9. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support under a long-term contract?    10. Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime vs. peacetime situations. 11. Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined above are attainable? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Keep in mind that this is a continuous improvement and learning exercise for the government and industry. We do not have all the answers nor do we even know all the right questions.  Please take time to relate to us any ideas/suggestions you may have in im proving our questionnaire or any other areas where you may have insight. Send responses to this market research survey questionnaire to the PM POCs by email: Joe Scott e-mail address: scottjoe@tacom.Army.mil and Bob Schulkins e-mail address: schulkir@tacom.army.mil.  Your organization may provide response to all or part of this  questionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 14 March 06.   The response can be marked as confidential.  Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietary if appropriate.  All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for re sponding to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, et c. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE LWP System:  Lightweight Water Purifier (LWP) 	Model Designators:  Model M101 System Description:  The Lightweight Water Purifier, NSN 4610-01-495-0046, is made up of six modules.  Each module is designed to meet the Armys four man lift requirement and weigh around 200 pounds.  Each module houses a part of the system which when lin ked together, either with hoses or electrical connectors, makes up an entire operational LWP System.  There is also a 3KW, 60 HZ, Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG), NSN 6115-01-285-3012, used to supply electric power to the LWP System.  The TQG is powered wit h a diesel engine that can run on JP-8 or JP-4 aviation fuel or No. 2 Diesel Oil.  All the modules combined weigh less than 1650 lbs.  A 15 foot by 20 foot relatively flat area is needed to set up the LWP for operation.  There is additional support materie l furnished with the LWP System. When the weight of the support materiel is added to the modules the entire system weight is around 2000 pounds.  The LWP System along with all the support materiel is packed into a TRICON, NSN 8145-01-389-9184 in order to a llow using modular container material handling equipment to load and unload it from various transportation platforms.  The TRICON also offers better protection of the system during long term storage.   The purpose of the system is to purify any water source to make it potable so that it can be used for human consumption.  It accomplishes this by pumping the source water through an ultra-filter system then pumping the filtered water through a Reverse Osmo sis (RO) element.  A high pressure, 1200 psi, pump is required to pump the filtered water through the RO element.  The potable water produced is pumped into a 1000 gallon fabric storage tank.  The storage tank is about 6 foot in diameter and when full stan ds about 5 feet off of the ground.  When purifying fresh or brackish water, the LWP can produce 125 U.S. gallons of potable water every hour.  When purifying salt or sea water, the LWP can produce 75 U.S. gallons of potable water every hour.  The LWP can m aintain these production rates for water that contains up to 60,000 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).  A chemical injection pump is used to add chlorine into the product water for storage.   Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  The LWP will be used to purify raw water from a broad range of water sources for human consumption.  The governing parameters are the number of personnel for which support is required and the cli matic conditions in which it will be employed.  The system will be easily transported, compatible with ground, amphibious, air assault, and airborne units.  The system will be stored, transported, and operated in basic and hot (-28 to 160 degrees F) climat es (see AR 70-38).  Operations in temperatures below 32 degrees F will require a heated shelter provided by the using unit. b.  Wartime.  The LWP will be employed throughout the theater of operations as a Unit or Direct Support asset.  Units will use the LWP to provide sufficient quantities of water to small, mobile forces that cannot be re-supplied by standard supply point dis tribution or unit distribution support concepts.  Medical task forces will use the LWP when operating independently and at remote locations during low intensity conflict and when feasibility during initial and/or early entry to an undeveloped theater of op erations.  Special Forces Groups will employ the LWP throughout the operational area at locations where acceptable water supplies exist.  The LWP will be used to produce water that will be distributed at the point of production, line-hauled to forward supp ly points, and/or line-hauled to major consumers (e.g. local indigenous forces).  The anticipated duration for wartime missions is three months to one year.  The MP will generally consist of 75% operation under the conditions described for Situation 1 and 25% operation under conditions described for Situation 2 (see Tables 3 and 4). Table  1.  Threat Matrix for LWP Threat	Indirect Strike	Direct Strike Artillery	X	 Rockets	X	 Bombs		X Nuclear	X	 Biological	X	X Chemical	X	X Sabotage		X Raids	X	 Other theater area attack weapons	X	 c.  Peacetime.  The LWP will be deployed for support of foreign internal defense; unconventional warfare, civil affairs, special activities, and CONUS/OCONUS field training exercises.  It will be operated in the same manner as prescribed in the operational  concept and wartime OMS.  Additionally, the LWP will be used to support disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, and peacekeeping missions using the operational concept tailored to the situation.  The anticipated duration for peacetime mission is two wee ks (e.g., field training exercises) and up to one year for other peace operations.  Table 2 provides a distribution of peace operations for the LWP.  The mission profile will generally consist of 95% operation under the conditions described for Situation 1  (see Tables 3 and 4) and 5% operation under conditions described for situation 2 (see Tables 3 and 4).  The remainder of the peacetime operations will generally follow mission requirements. 			Table 2.

Fleet Assessment.  The LWP is a new system currently in Full Rate Production.  Currently there are 26 systems fielded to units.  An additional 331 LWP are on order and it is estimated th at 85 of these systems will be delivered in FY06.  Thereafter, a total of 35 additional systems will be procured FY07-FY08. Reliability  Mean Time Between Essential Function Failure (MTBEFF):  Estimated at 300 hrs MTBEFF Depot Capability  Current Workload:  None Current Organic Support:   1.  Supply and Logistics Support: Support objectives for initial operational capability is full organic support and compatible with the current structure in place Supply support requirements were generated from a detailed analysis of maintenance tasks that identified all resources required for system support.  Provisioning Technical Documentation was used for the identification, selection, determination of initial r equirements, and cataloging of support items to be procured through the provisioning process.  The LWP IPT reviewed and approved the Spare Parts List and the Long Lead Time Item List.  The Provisioning Data permits NSN assignment, as required, and the proc urement and stockage of high-demand items. Initial spares (Authorized Stockage List [ASL] is provided to gaining units and funded by PM PAWS.  Replenishment spares will be stocked according to demand, funded and requisitioned by the using activity. 2.  Maintenance Concepts:  The system utilizes organic logistical support for the maintenance and servicing of the LWP and conforms to the requirements and guidance IAW AR 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and DA PAM 738-750 (Functional Users Manual  for The Army Maintenance Management System [TAMMS]). Maintenance will correspond to the Two-Level Maintenance System concept (Field and Sustainment).  It is the Program Managers intent to transition to the two level maintenance concepts in FY07.  Current manuals will transition from four-level maintenance to  support two-level maintenance at the field and sustainment levels. Field includes operator preventative maintenance (C), unit maintenance (O) and some direct support maintenance (F).  Sustainment will also include some direct support maintenance as well a s all general support maintenance (H).  Field and Sustainment maintenance will be preformed using standard tools, test, measurement and diagnostic equipment.  No depot support is envisioned for the LWP.  A Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS ) and a Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) are included in the system technical manual. The LWP has an operational reliability of 300 hours mean time between essential function failure (MTBEFF), a mean time to repair (MTTR) no greater than one hour for all unscheduled maintenance demands (UMD), and a maximum time to repair (MaxTTR) no greater  than two hours for 90 percent of all essential unscheduled maintenance demands (EUMD).   3. Training and Training Devices:  The Materiel Developer will provide a complete training package that will support all phases of training for the LWP.  The Training Support Package (TSP) was developed to support New Equipment (NET), Institutional and Sus tainment Training.  The system TSP is designed and developed IAW U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-70 within the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database.  The LWP system TSP includes electronic technical manuals  (ETM), program of instruction, lesson plans, student and instructor guides and an instructional Distributive Training Vehicle (DTV) Web-based interactive multimedia package on the operation and maintenance of the LWP.  The DTV will be provided for use in sustainment training and to facilitate distance learning.    Instructor and key personnel training (I&KPT) was provided for the initial transfer of information and training methods from the materiel developer to the trainer.  Distance learning is also bein g considered as a method of providing NET. The first production LWP was provided to the Quartermaster and Ordnance Maintenance Mechanical Schools for use in institutional training.

<CONTACT>Michael Rowan, 508-233-4965
<DESC>Description: Special Operations Command is requesting information from industry regarding an improved Back pack suite to replace the current issued SPEAR BALCS Pack. The BALCS Pack consists of the Butt pack, the Patrol pack and the Rucksack. The Butt  pack volume is 350-450 ci, the Patrol pack is 2000 ci and the Rucksack is 7000 ci with a total system weight of 21.25 lbs. Of great interest is information regarding the reduction of weight and packed volume while maintaining other operational capabilitie s of the pack system. Desired characteristics:  The new pack suite will consist of four packs instead of three to better meet the mission requirements of the Force. The shoulder/courier style pack (700-1000 ci, 2 lb threshold, 1 lb objective), the Assault pack (2800-3000 ci, 5 lb threshold, 4lb objective), the Patrol pack (4000-4500 ci, 8 lb threshold, 5 lb objective) and the Recce pack (6000-6500 ci, 11 lb threshold, 7 lb objective). Consideration is given to the lighter weight greater capacity pack. The p ack suite may consist of internal, external and hybrid or modular framesets. Ideally the Patrol and Recce pack backs would be interchangeable on one modular frameset to reduce overall system weight and bulk.  Note: F2153-01 Standard Test Method for Measurement of backpack volume will be used as the baseline Volumes required is un-extended backpack capacity, main compartment + lid. Pockets and additions will be measured separately. Salient characteristics for all packs: The frame and/or its supporting elements shall be ergonomically efficient and sized to optimize compartment and equipment placement (Minimum number of sizes with minimum number of adjustments).  Provide adjustments (straps, cords, or other mechanism) to al low the shifting of the load from the shoulders to hips and vice versa to minimize local discomfort/muscle strain in those areas while wearing the system.  The majority of the weight should be placed on the hips.  The shoulder straps will provide a clean s urface to the front which will not interfere with shouldering and firing the weapon. The External frame and Hybrid frame must be ALICE pack bag compatible. The ALICE pack bag is the old Vietnam era Army ruck sack found in any Army / Navy store. Provide for well padded and easily adjustable (in the opinion of the SOF operator) hip belt, lumbar support and shoulder straps to allow for changes in waist size and back and shoulder lengths. Environmental conditions cannot degrade the system to the extent that it cannot be used for its intended mission: 	1. Must withstand the effects of the full range of operational environments 	2. Must be rot, mildew, POL, chlorine, UV light and salt water resistant 	3. Must have a shelf life of not less than three years. Color choices should be consistent with Load Carriage Systems, Ranger green and Khaki, Coyote. Are these colors available in the marketplace? Will provide for an internal radio pocket positioned high against the pack frame with tie down straps capable of holding a suite of SOF radios to include the  AN/PRC 117E (3.2H x 10.5W x 13.5D). Utilizing a minimum amount of MOLLE webbing provide for the attachment of external items with minimal interference to the SOF operators movement Will provide a means for hydration and communications pass thrus. 1. The Recce pack requirements also include the following: a. Have a top flap and 2 pleated pockets on the exterior sides of the rucksack that are easily accessible in the opinion of the SOF operator.  The pockets will be capable of holding one of the following (for sizing purposes): At least 1 x M18Al Claymore mine complete An MRE Wet weather gear (top and bottom) Poncho Poncho liner Map case Spotting scope Tent poles (16 inches) b. The pockets will be tunneled to allow elongated equipment such as skis, poles, ice axes etc to be stowed vertically without affecting the load capacity of either the pocket or main compartment . c. Have a lower compartment that is separate from the main compartment by means of a reach through divider. This second compartment accessed via an external zipper will be large enough to place the sleeping bag, extreme cold into it. Berry Amendment.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

FOR

MOD/JHQ/IAF PERSONNEL DATABSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1. BACKGROUND:  The Ministry of Defense and Iraqi Armed Forces (IAF) require a personnel database management system to properly manage military, police, and civilian personnel resources throughout the personnel life cycle of accession, training, distribution/assignment, sustainment separation/retirement and accommodate organizational structure changes and development.

2. GENERAL SCOPE. Web based access to an open architecture centrally managed personnel database system for the Ministry of Defense Headquarters (DG Personnel and DG Budget); 10 geographically separated Base Support Units; the Joint Headquarters M1/M8 staff; The Iraqi Army Headquarters M1 staff; 10 Army Division HQ G-1 staffs;, 35 Army Brigade HQ S-1 staffs;, HQ Iraqi Air Force M1 staff;, Iraqi Navy Headquarters and HQ Iraq Special Ops forces.  The system should emulate Army Knowledge on-line, Marine Corps Total Force System, or IBM 3270.  The infrastructure is supported by Iraq Support network (IDN).  This IDN network deployment is phased and the database implementation plan needs to take these phases into account.  The system must be 95% operable based on a 30-day period.  Operability is defined as application level connections.

3. PHASES AND REQUIREMENTS:  This is a two phased project.

a. PHASE 1:  The anticipated Phase 1 duration is no longer than 90-days.   This time frame does not include required in-processing and transportation to and from Iraq.  In phase one the contractor will conduct a requirements analysis which will include consultation with members of the Iraqi Joint Headquarters M1/M8 and MOD DG Personnel and DG Budget Staffs, and MNSTC-I J6/J1/J8.  The contractor will submit a written proposal to MNSTC-I J1 that details all equipment, software licenses for 3 years, and service fees associated with this project.  The written proposal must also include the following requirements.

i. Design an open architecture personnel management database solution system capable of servicing 175,000 employees (soldiers, sailors, airmen, policemen and civilians) of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  It must have the capability to expand in increments of 5,000 or 10,000 to a maximum of 300,000 personnel. It should be centrally managed with web based data input capability at lower levels.  The database must be able to track current recruits, retirees, and recently separated personnel.  

ii. The database management interface must be in the Arabic language and include:

1. Position Control – A position control module will be the foundation of the personnel database management system.  Positions will be budgeted for, approved and assigned to specific organizational units.  Vacant positions will be identified for recruitment.  Filled positions will be reported against and compared to budget.  Budget vs. Actuals may be reported at a summary level, organizational unit level or down to the position level. There needs to be “position flexibility” in the sense that there are times when units are temporarily overmanned for operational reasons or to cover programmed losses due to retirement/separation etc. 
2. Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSA’s) – A database of KSA’s will help integrate requirements across positions, potential recruits, employees, training, performance evaluation and succession planning.  A list of required KSA’s will be assigned to each position.  Potential recruits can be evaluated based on the KSA’s they possess as compared to the required KSA’s of the vacant position.  A database of KSA’s can be maintained for each employee allowing for quick answers to questions like, “Do we have any soldiers with telecommunication skills who are fluent in Kurdish in this set of battalions?”  Training courses can be categorized by relevant KSA’s and employees can be targeted for training based on gaps between KSA’s they possess vs. the KSA’s required of their current or anticipated future positions.  Similarly, KSA’s can form the basis for performance evaluations and succession planning.
3. Flexibility – The requirements of the personnel database management system will change, sometimes rapidly, as the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior evolve over the near and long terms.  
4. Audit Trails – The personnel database management system will have a built-in audit feature that can track which system user made what change at what time and indicate the old and new data values. 
5. Hierarchal Permission Structure to limit changes from lower levels in the organization.  For example, a battalion should only have access to view and make changes to personnel assigned to that specific battalion.  A brigade should only have access to every person assigned to that brigade etc.
 
iii. The proposed solution must provide for the following key areas associated with Personnel life cycle management.  
1. Force Management
a. Manpower Requirements Management
b. Recruiting
c. Accessions
d. Accountability
e. Casualty/Martyr/Survivor Benefits
f. Assignments
g. Promotions (promotion eligibility/indicator codes)
h. Leave
i. Performance Evaluation
j. Disciplinary Actions
k. Reenlistments
l. Testing
m. Pay
n. Combat Readiness
o. Records Management
p. Separations
q. Retirements
r. Duty Status (AWOL, Present for Duty, Leave etc)
s. Awards
t. Military Education/Civilian Education
u. Medical (date of last physical)
v. Physical Fitness 
w. Emergency Data (DD form 93)
x. Language/Specialty Identifier Codes
y.  Basic Active Service Date
z. Separation Date
aa. Separation Codes

2. Force Development
a. Vetting
b. Training
c. Senior Leader Development
d. Occupational Specialty Management
3. Budgeting
4. Long Range Personnel Planning
5. Demographic data – including age, tribe, religion (Muslim, Christian, etc.) and sect (Sunni, Shi’ite, Kurd etc.), ethnicity, marital status, education level, gender

<ARCHDATE>10072006
<CONTACT>Tara Obenstine, 410-278-0863
<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information and is not an Invitation to Bid or a Request for Proposals.  There is currently no funding for this effort.     In support of the Department of Defense (DOD) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy and its objectives for the implementation of passive RFID within the DOD supply chain, Project Manager Soldier Equipment (PM-SEQ) has a requirement to integrate passive RFID technology into the current business operations of the PM-SEQ Staging/New Equipment Training (NET) Facility at Haymarket, VA.     The PM-SEQ Staging/NET Facility at Haymarket, VA currently employs a proprietary SQL based Inventory Management System (IMS) providing the following main supply management process steps:            Inventory            Receiving            Shipping            Issuing     The IMS utilizes handheld computer units (Falcon 4420) with integrated laser scanners and wireless communication for bi-directional communications with the IMS.      The handheld computer units constitute the core interface between the operator and the IMS, allowing for data entry and process related information display, as well as through its menu-driven display assisting operators in the execution of the supply c hain processes identified above. Required Capability     PM-SEQ requires the following capabilities in a passive RFID system.  All proposed systems shall meet current DOD standards.    1- Asset Visibility for Receiving and Shipping. PM-SEQ requires the capability to read passive RFID tags at access and exit pinch points (e.g. facility dock doors) on all shipments tagged with passive RFID labels.  Data will be automatically read, collected and transferred to the IMS, thus minimizing th e need for manual data entry.  Examples of this would include capturing data necessary to increase or decrease inventory levels.  There are currently four pinch points in the PM-SEQ facility.   2- Asset Visibility for Issuing. PM-SEQ requires the ability to write passive RFID tags in support of the issuing process.  The requirement includes writing tags at the case level and consolidating the case level information to a pallet level tag.  Passive RFID labeled shipments shall be read at the pinch points with data collected and transferred to the IMS.   3- Asset Visibility for Advance Shipping Notification (ASN). PM-SEQ requires the ability to provide ASN to customers.  The proposed system shall incorporate the ability to support ASN through the use of standard (e.g. web or EDI-based) ASN transactions.     4- Ability to Read Passive RFID Tags/RFID-Enabled Labels. Any proposed system must include the ability to read EPC global or DOD-construct compliant RFID tags/RFID-enabled labels on incoming DLA or Direct Vendor shipments, and then transfer this information to the IMS.   5- Ability to Print and Verify Passive RFID Tags. Any proposed system shall print and verify EPCglobal or DOD-construct compliant RFID-enabled Military Shipping Labels (MSL) according to DD Form 1387 for outgoing shipments. The RFID-enabled labels would be printed for Cases (Exterior Container or Shipping  Container) and Pallets (as defined by MIL-STD-129) and would be based on issuing information received from the IMS.   6- Ability to Provide Inventory Transaction Data (incoming/outgoing) to IMS. Any proposed system shall interface with the IMS to provide event data about RFID-enabled shipments received or sent (when read at dock doors), and to receive shipment data required to print RFID-enabled DD Form 1387 MSL for any outgoing shipments.   7- Ability to Generate and Send ASN Based on DODIC 856S or 856A to DOD receiver. Any proposed system shall generate a Standard Ship Notice/Manifest Transaction Set (EDI 856) through electronic transmission methods (XML, EDI) for all outgoing shipments for which RFID-enabled DD Form 1387 MSL have been printed.   8- Dock Door RFID Portals. PM-SEQ requires passive RFID Reader Portals at fo ur (4) facility dock doors. These reader portals will provide incoming or outgoing shipment pinch-point read capability.   9- Expansion capabilities. Any proposed system shall provide for future expansion capabilities.  These capabilities shall include the ability for expansion of capabilities at the Haymarket VA location, and at PM-SEQ facilities at other geographical locations.   10- System Interface.  Any proposed systems must interface with the current IMS and other DOD information systems such as DAAS (for ASN transactions). Installation and Integration Services PM-SEQ requires the following installation and integration services:  1- IMS Integration. The service provider shall provide all necessary engineering services required to integrate the proposed system with the pre-existing IMS system; services will include set-up and configuration of bi-directional communications through TCP/IP over Ethernet i n support of the following.   1.1 Read Data Integration. The service provider shall provide all necessary engineering services to integrate data read from passive RFID pinch-points (Dock doors) to enable IMS to update inventory and/or shipment status information.   1.2 Issue Data Integration. The service provider shall provide all necessary engineering services to integrate data generated by the existing IMS required to print passive RFID labels for outgoing shipments.   1.3 ASN Transmission Integration. The service provider shall provide all necessary engineering services required to interface the proposed system with DOD IT systems configured to receive Advance Shipping Information.  Services will include set-up and configuration of single-directional co mmunications from the proposed system to DOD IT system. .   1.4 Installation. The system provider will provide all necessary installation services required to set up, install and configure the proposed system components provided under this proposal.   1.5 Training.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Composite Munitions Fabrication Request for Information
<DESC>ADDITIONAL GENERAL INFORMATION This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs. GENERAL INTENT The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) has recently ground-tested the first 250lb class low collateral damage composite-cased munitions for application in urban warfare and close air support.  The composite case disintegrates into non-lethal fibers upon detonation reducing collateral damage significantly in comparison to conventional steel-cased munitions.  The composite case is mated to a steel nose for urban structure penetration and contains an aft steel coupler ring for integration with conventional fuzes.  An internal strong-back is used for lug integration.  The lightweight composite case is filled with a ballasted explosive to control mass, center of gravity and inertial moments consistent with the Miniature Munitions Technology Demonstrator configuration developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory.  The 250lb class low collateral damage munition was subjected to concrete penetration tests and static detonation tests.  The concrete penetration tests demonstrated the composite munitions ability to survive gun-launch and concrete penetration at operational impact velocities through reinforced conventional strength concrete with moderate obliquity.  The static detonation tests demonstrated low collateral potential and allowed blast characterization of the composite munitions for lethality analyses.  The intent of this request is to identify potential composite munitions vendors with demonstrated experience in the design, fabrication and testing of ½-scale and full-scale 250lb class composite penetrators.  This RFI provides interested contractors an opportunity to present to the government their capability and experience in composite munitions design, fabrication and test. The Government will not respond to those submitting to this RFI except in the case a clarification of the information provided is required by the Government review team. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals, and will not result in a Government contract. SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION Responses to this request must be received by the Government no later than close of business 27 FEB 2006. Responders shall provide one electronic copy (Microsoft Word or .pdf formats ) and one paper copy of their documentation (five pages or less). Information packages containing more than five pages will be returned, unread, to the sender. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper with information on it. Minimum print size is 10 point type, or 12 pitch. If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then those pages should be marked accordingly. Documentation shall be delivered to the contract specialist at the following address: AFRL/MNK ATTN: Brenda M. Soler 101 W Eglin Blvd STE 337 Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810 Telephone: (850) 883-2680 Email: brenda.soler@eglin.af.mil ADDITIONAL INFORMATION For technical questions contact Mr. Don Cunard, (850) 882-7994, donald.cunard@eglin.af.mil. All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered by the Government Evaluation Team, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed above.

Announcement of New Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification (CBSV) Service by the Social Security Administration (SSA)

SSA is planning to offer a new service to any interested parties.  As long as the party first obtains the required written consent of the number holder, we will, for a fee, verify a name and Social Security number combination as being correct (or incorrect) for any party registered to use the service.  There also will be a substantial fee to register to use the service because Social Security Trust Fund monies cannot be used to develop this service.  This new service is contingent on OMB approval.  Currently, we anticipate a May or June 2006 start date for the service.  There will be a limited time for parties to enroll in this service.  Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3- year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

Please see Federal Register Notice Social Security Administration:  Agency Information Collection Activities:  Proposed Request, dated December 30, 2005, for more information about this service and to request documents such as the User Agreement that the party would sign with SSA and the consent form that must be completed by the Social Security number holder prior to you being permitted to send a request for Social Security number verification to SSA for processing.

Attachment 1

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB
						
FROM:  AWC/DF

SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request #F2XHC36033A100
(General Michael P. C. Carns)

1.  The Air War College, Department of International Security Studies (AWC/DFI), requests that General Carns (USAF, retired) provide consultant services to Air War College students and faculty during  the Oceania Regional Studies (RS) course for the period of 24 February-10 March 2006.  The requirements of this position include: attend all class activities on days scheduled by the Trip Director or Academic Instructor; accompany the RS delegation on international travel; assist the Academic Instructor in leading the discussion during the two-hour session following the trip; advise students on an informal basis in order to derive maximum benefit during the regional studies trips; and, attend any recommended meetings or briefings with AWC officials.  The total estimated cost is $xxxxx.

2.  General (ret) Carns is uniquely qualified for this position.a.  He is a retired general with significant strategic-level experience.  He served as the Vice Chief of Staff for the Air Force, as Director Operations for Central Command, and as the Director of the Joint Staff.  General (ret) Carns is a Senior Mentor in the JCS Chairman's CAPSTONE program, an intensive six-week course that the Goldwaters-Nichols DoD Reorganization Act of 1986 requires all newly-selected flag officers to attend.  Retired four-star flag officers are attached to each CAPSTONE class as Senior Fellows to provide advice and guidance.  This role continues to give him routine access to foreign senior military leaders in the region.  These services require extensive experience in senior leadership specific to the region to be visited which only Gen (ret) Carns can provide.  Failure to contract Gen (ret) Carns for his services could result in significant negative impact on AU and AWC.  The combination of his active duty experience, academic credentials, his post-active duty leadership, and vast network of contacts, expertise, and subject area experience makes him an invaluable resource for the Oceania Regional Studies Course.  Gen (ret) Carns’ experience is unique and unmatched; no other contractor holds or can acquire his expertise or experiences.  

3.  A sources sought synopsis for acquisition of similar services was posted on Fedbizopps 19 Oct 05 for a with only one response outside the suggested source.  Col (ret) Robert L. Klein, US Army, expressed written interest in the acquisition in response to the sources sought.  Col (ret) Klein does not meet the requirement of MAJCOM/CC experience, which is a 4-Star billet.  To allow for competition of this acquisition would not be feasible because Gen (ret) Carns’ experience is unique.  No other consultant would provide the same benefit to the Oceania Regional Studies Trip and the AWC, AU mission.  A notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Gen (ret) Michael Carns will be posted on Fedbizopps with a contract start date of  24 Feb 06.

4.	This information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.  No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions.  Upon a change in the AWC and AU curriculum, another contractor may be able to fulfill this requirement negating the need for future sole source.

5.  Colonel Stephen Schwalbe, Director of AWC Regional Studies Course, is our point of contact and can be reached at 953-xxxx.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>ANSWERS to SITE VISIT QUESTIONS & PROPOSAL EXTENSION ################### The receipt of offers has been extended from 12:00 Noon, Eastern Standard Time, 17 Feb 06, to 12:00 Noon, Eastern Standard Time, 23 Feb 06.  ################### Memorandum for Site Visit held, 10 Feb 06 at 10:00 AM, regarding ASFI announcement, AMSRDT-AR-0-3206, for Technical Information Search Services and Library & Bibliographical Support   At the session the following questions were addressed:   Question 1. Will TACOM (customer is not TACOM but is TARDEC, the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center which is part of RDECOM) only require two contractors?   Answer 1.   The facility can house two contractors at any given time; however the appropriate number and type of personnel is to be determined by the contractor in order to provide the services. This is fixed price contract.   Questions 2. Are there written job descriptions for each of the contractors required?    Answer 2.  No.  This is not a T&M contract, but is to be firm fixed price.   Question 3.  Will proof of ORCA registration replace provision 52-212-3?   Answer 3 Yes.  ORCA registration will suffice.   Question 4.  Is this a new requirement?   Answer 4.   No   Question 5. Are there contractors currently performing the functions described in the Synopsis?   Answer 5. Yes   Question 6.  What is the OPSEC Process?   Answer 6.   Operations Security (OPSEC) is an integral element of Information Operations and Force Protection and an integral part of this requirements Statement of Work. The purpose of the OPSEC review is to help ensure the protection of information wh ich may be considered sensitive or critical. OPSEC reviews are required for all publications prior to distribution to the public domain. The general rule is: ALL PUBLICATIONS THAT ARE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC MUST COMPLETE AN OPSEC REVIEW.  The TIC is the registration/archival site for technical, popular and academic publications. Note that technical documents include journal articles, refereed papers, technical reports, conference proceedings, and papers written for professional societies. P opular publications consist of work published in a magazine or newspaper. Theses and dissertations are considered academic documents. It is important to note that publications/materials that are not required to be registered with the TIC such as website pu blications, videos, briefing notes, and slide presentations must also complete an OPSEC review prior to distribution to the public.  Question 7.  What are the total number of labor hours per year that should be used?  Answer 7.  It is up to the contractor to develop the appropriate staffing as part of their proposal for this firm fixed price contract.  The previous contract was T&M and used 1920 hours per year, but the SOW has changed.  Question 8. What would be the government pay grade level for these positions?  Answer 8.  Depends on the qualifications the contractors identify on their proposals and needed to perform the fixed price services.  Question 9. What are the minimum benefits required for these positions?  Answer 9. Again a fixed price contract leaves this to the determination of the contractors within the requirements for government contract (FICA, etc).  If unknown, contact Small Business Office.   Question 10. Would TACOM--(TARDEC RDECOM) be willing to place these people on GSA contract?  Answer 10.  It is up to the contractor to seek a GSA contract or propose GSA rates if they already have a GSA contract.  This competition is full and open for small businesses and not limited to GSA contractors.  Question 11. How many companies were notified of this Synopsis?  Answer 11.  This was posted publicly on ASFI/FedBizOpps.  Question 12. Should we include escalations in the price or will they be automatically added?  Answer 12. Include escalations in your option year pricing.  The pr ice of all option years will be evaluated.   Question 13. What Software are the databases comprised of (e.g. access, excel) that contractors will be asked to maintain?    Answer 13. Microsoft office and Government modified.  We do not wish to develop a new software package under this contract. These questions were received but not addressed in the meeting: 1.  Question 1.  Is this request for an extension to an existing contract with an incumbent supplier or is this a new requirement?   Answer  1.  Existing contract is with Praxis Communications,  DAAE07-03-P-L752  Question 2.  What is the current staffing level for the current volumes of data requirements?   Answer2.  1920 contractor hours per year  Question 3.  Is the secret clearance for existing employees a prerequisite in order to proceed or would the hiring of a project manager with a clearance serve the need?  Answer 3. All employees of the contractor must have a secret clearance before the services can be provided and before duties begin. Question 4. Is the staffing requirements for 100% on-site personnel or would a combination of on-site and remote personnel be a workable solution?   Answer 4.  All work must be done on-site to meet security requirements.  Question5.  For references are commercial reference acceptable or must they be all government references.   Answer 5.  References of like-services will be the most beneficial --commercial is acceptable if it documents past performances of like-services.  General Clarification Discussion:   Resumes of staff who will do the work not required but would improve decision process.   A contract is expected to be awarded early in March.

This solicitation will be issued as A TOTALLY SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS negotiated procurement with Source Selection procedures.  The selection of contractors will be pursuant to the best value concept.  All proposals received under this Request for Proposals will individually be ranked based on technical and price proposals submitted in comparison to the evaluation criteria listed below.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of technical capability and price.  (For this procurement, demonstrated technical capability is more important than price).  AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.

The evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.  FAILURE TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED EVIDENCE AND / OR RELATED INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY GSA WILL RESULT IN A FINDING OF NON-RESPONSIBILITY AS DEFINED BY FAR PART 9.    

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

Factor A: Experience and Qualifications - Past performance and experience on similar projects:  

Offerors are requested to demonstrate their construction experience in fully occupied office facilities by providing a list of five successful projects completed within the past five years, similar in dollar value, similar in nature, and similar working conditions as those anticipated in this contract. (The range of construction costs of the five projects should be between $2,000 and $25,000).  The list shall not exceed five pages.  

At least three of the five projects must be between $10,000 and $15,000, and one of the projects must be over $20,000.  Discuss the firm’s experience in handling such projects simultaneously.  Experience with managing multiple, simultaneous projects is considered an asset.  Offerors are required to provide the following information for each project submitted  (limit each project to one page).  

For the evaluation of this criterion, the firm is required to provide the following (limited to a maximum of five pages):
 
~  Name and location of the project
~  A description of the project 
~  Award amount and the final cost at construction completion 
~  Actual work the firm performed 
~  Owner’s name, telephone number, address, and person to contact
~  For each project listed, provide the number of other projects, dollar values, and a brief description of the projects which were performed concurrently with that project 

Board members will evaluate past performance by contacting references provided and discussing the offerors performance on the listed projects, addressing workmanship, timeliness, cost control, and technical success of the project.  The Board may also choose additional methods to evaluate past performance, such as visiting the site of the completed projects, Contractor Performance System (CPS), etc.  

Factor B:  Key Personnel Qualifications:  

Identify key personnel for the project team for orders to be placed under this contract and list their responsibilities, qualifications, and positions for the proposed projects.  Complete resumes for key personnel shall be provided for each member proposed to work on this contract and should list their education, training, qualifications, and experience relative to the tasks they will be performing (limited to four pages).  Include professional qualifications, specialized experience in this type of work and the technical competence of the staff on similar projects.  The government desires that key personnel have five or more years of construction renovation experience in occupied facilities.  Demonstrate that the project team has the ability to provide mechanical, architectural, electrical, and plumbing renovations in occupied buildings.  Offerors are required to discuss previous experience that the proposed key personnel may have in working together on past projects.  

Factor C:  Technical and Organizational Approach: 

1.  Offerors are required to present the resource allocation for handling construction orders simultaneously.  Discuss the firm’s technical and organizational abilities for performing projects in fully occupied facilities for projects costing between $2,000 and $25,000.  The discussions should include the team’s proposed organizational approach in addressing the management of construction projects simultaneously.  Describe how project phasing is managed.  In addition, describe how the construction performed under this will be managed and what methods will be employed to ensure timely and satisfactory completion of projects.  Use examples where appropriate.  Include a discussion of how the work will be accomplished regarding subcontractors and in-house staff.  Contractor’s employing an in-house staff is considered an asset.  

2.  If subcontracting is anticipated, include a list of proposed subcontractors and discuss their construction project experience.  Established, ongoing subcontractor relationship is considered to be an asset.  

PRICE PROPOSALS:

Past performance, personnel qualifications and technical qualifications are deemed to be the most important elements since GSA is seeking firms who will complete projects successfully and with the best workmanship.  The price is considered to be of importance, but not as important as the other three factors, since the overall goal is to acquire firms possessing technical expertise with sound professional backgrounds.  Source Selection Procedures require price to be a related factor, and award will be based on a combination of all four factors (Price becomes more important when the difference in technical scores is insignificant.)

Each offeror must submit unit prices for all items listed on Attachment A to the Standard Form 1442 for work to be performed during normal working hours for the base year of the contract.  The contractor shall also propose a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour Work for the Base Year; multiplier percentage factor for each of the four Option Years; a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour work for each of the four Option Years; and a multiplier percentage factor for travel.  

A multiplier percentage factor may be reflected as a plus, a minus, or "net".  For example, a percentage factor of plus 10 percent should be reflected as (+10%); a percentage factor of minus 10 percent should be reflected as (-10%).  Submitting the word "net" means the proposer will accept all line item prices as they are stated without any percent change.

NOTE: This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. The Bidder / Offeror must submit the attached DOCUMENT SECURITY FORM signed by the bidder / offeror. The document requires a copy of the business license, a DUNS Number and a IRS TAX ID Number. Request for Construction Documents Exhibit _______________ Attachment _______________ Solicitation _______________ DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. REASONABLE CARE: 1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below: Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: (a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and (b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.
