<DESC>NA This is a synopsis for a noncommercial cost plus fixed fee research effort entitled: Aviation Diagnostic and Engine Prognostic Technology (ADEPT), T55 Engine.  The program objective is to perform a test cell demonstration of the ADEPT software on a T55-GA- 714A engine.  Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) proposes to implement on a sole-source basis program to conduct initial testing of the existing ADEPT software into the T55-GA-714A engine.  The ADEPT software contains engine-specific algorithms  that reside on the engine to perform diagnostics of components with links to technical manuals, event detection, prognostics, and engine health management at the aircraft and fleet levels.  The T55-GA-714A is the production engine for the CH-47 aircraft.  The Contractor is Honeywell, International, Inc., Phoenix, AZ.  This program will update the existing ADEPT software to incorporate the latest performance curves, demonstrate the technology on an engine in a test cell and prepare a software implementation  road map for airworthiness qualification.  The ADEPT software is the only package available that contains the numerous algorithms necessary for embedded diagnostics, prognostics, and engine health management for the T55-GA-714A engine.  The algorithms and  ADEPT software are property of Honeywell, and the Government does not own the rights to the algorithms.  This requirement will be conducted pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source, a nd no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Alpha contract negotiations will be limited to Honeywell International, Inc.  Honeywell, as manufacturer of the T55-GA-714A engine, is deemed the only responsible source uniquely qualified  to perform this program.  Specifications, plans or drawings or software relating to this procurement are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The period of performance for this program is approximately six (6) months.  The North Ameri can Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  The size standard is 1000.  The Government anticipates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract, which will be developed jointly between the Government and Honeywell Internationa l, Inc., Phoenix, AZ consistent with alpha contracting procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses, and provisions in accordance with the FAR.  No options are included in this acquisition.  While the government does not anticipate competition, any r esponsible source may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSAM-RD-AA-C (John H. Barbie), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Contracting Officer is Sharon M. Horton who can be reached at 757-878-0086 or shorton@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address (facsimile 757-878-0008 or jbarbie@aatd.eustis.army.mil.)  Proposals are due by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, June 3, 2003.  Award under this announcement is anticipated to be no later than June 27, 2003.  FBO Numbered Notes: 8, 22 and 26.

PROJECT INFORMATION:   The Lower Fox River and Green Bay Site includes an approximately 39-mile s tretch of the Lower Fox River as well as the bay of Green Bay.  The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have issued  a final Superfund Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study report as wel l as supporting documents for the site.  In addition, DNR and EPA also issued a Superfund Record of Decision (ROD), Responsiveness Summary (RS), and numerous (17) white papers for the Site’s first two operable units.  The plan in the ROD calls for cleaning  up PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contaminated sediments from certain portions of the Lower Fox River.  The ROD was issued in December 2002 and will cover Operable Unit 1 (Little Lake Butte des Morts) and Operable Unit-2 (from the Appleton Dam to the Litt le Rapids Dam).  The general project information that follows is not all inclusive of the ROD.   PCB's were discharged into the Fox River by paper mills during the manufacturing and recycling of carbonless copy paper, primarily between 1954 and 1971. This ROD represents the final decision of the WDNR and EPA on the remedial plan for sediment cleanup of these two sections of the Lower Fox River. The ROD addresses some of the human health and ecological risks posed to people and ecological receptors associated with PCB’s that have been released to the Site.  These reaches comprise approximately 26 of the 39 miles of the river that flows north from Lake Winnebago to the mouth of the river at Green Bay. This ROD calls for the removal of all contaminated sediment from OU 1 with a concentration of greater than 1 part per million or approximately 784,000 cubic yards of material. It is anticipated that the dredged material  will be mechanically dewatered and then placed into a landfill for permanent disposal.  Another remedy may utilize vitrification of dredged contaminated sediment as an alternative to off-site disposal. DNR and EPA have selected a monitored natural recover y approach for OU 2. This cleanup relies on natural processes to break down, dilute, or bury the PCBs; and on a program designed to monitor the levels of PCBs in the sediment fish tissue and in the water. The current estimated average surface PCB concentra tion in OU-2 is 0.61 ppm.  With the ROD for OU-1 and 2 completed, WDNR and EPA will focus their attention to completing the ROD for the remaining operable units of the Lower Fox River and Green Bay (OU 3-5). The agencies expect a decision for the remaining  three operable units, OU-3 from the Little Rapids Dam to the De Pere Dam, OU-4 from the De Pere Dam to the mouth of the river at Green Bay, and OU-5 the entire bay of Green Bay, to be made later this year.  Copies of the OU 1 and 2 ROD, RS & White Papers,  the Site wide final RI/FS, FOX River Data Base as well as other supporting information is available at the DNR’s Lower Fox River web site at the following address: http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/wm/lowerfox/index.html.  In addition, to review hard c opies of the reports, copies of the ROD and the final RI/FS are available at one of the information repositories set up at libraries in the Fox Valley and Green Bay area. Appleton Public Library, 225 N. Oneida St., Appleton, WI;  Brown County Library, 515 Pine St., Green Bay, WI;  Door County Library, 104 S. Fourth Ave., Sturgeon Bay, WI; Oneida Community Library, 201 Elm St., Oneida, WI and the Oshkosh Public Library, 106 Washington Ave., Oshkosh, WI.  In addition to the repositories, copies of the Lower F ox River and Green Bay Site Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS), Risk Assessment (RA), the Model Documentation Report (MDR), and ROD may be available at DNR offices in Madison (101 South Webster Street), Green Bay (801 East Walnut Street) and at EPA offices in Chicago (77 West Jackson Boulevard).  A Corps of Engineers Section 905(b) (WRDA 86) Reconnaissance Study has concluded that there is Federal interest in the removal or remediation of contaminated sediments in the Lower Fox River and b ay of Green Bay for ecosystem restoration under the authority of Section 312 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 (WRDA 90), as amended.  A copy of the Reconnaissance Study will be available at the Detroit District Corps of Engineers web site htt p://www.lre.usace.army.mil for the Lower Fox River and Bay of Green Bay, Wisconsin site.  Additional ecosystem restoration project planning and studies are required to develop plan formulation criteria and tools (e.g., models) and metrics for measuring the  outputs (e.g.: habitat units, indices) of alternative plans appropriate for the ecosystem under consideration.  Design services may also be required to implement selected remediation alternatives within the project limits, including Operable Units 3, 4 an d 5.    Planning activities may include preparation of a feasibility study or portions thereof and an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment which shall be conducted in accordance with the Planning Guidance Notebook ER 1105-2-100 and ot her applicable U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulations, guidelines and procedures.  Public outreach efforts may also be required for this study. The local spon sor may conduct some tasks in the feasibility study and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other agencies may conduct some of the tasks.   3.

<DESC>NAVAIR Patuxent River, MD will be hosting an Industry Day Conference to discuss new technologies in the area of Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft (HULA).  This conference will be a forum to inform interested companies and individuals of the Government’s intent to explore hybrid aircraft technology for various military missions, especially for transglobal heavy life.  The envisioned product of this effort is a family of Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft (HULA) with 30 to 1000 ton payload capability which can transport outsized cargo between areas which lack prepared reception facilities, to include operations from water. Hybrid aircraft are lighter than air (LTA) vehicles which combine static lift from the buoyancy of helium gas with aerodynamic lift derived from the lifting body shape of the pressure envelope.  A feature that is vital to the perceived military utility of a HULA is its ability to operate from unprepared surfaces and without forward base support; it is not dependent upon access to runways or seaports. The program plan entails beginning with the design, construction, flight test and evaluation of relatively small 500 pound payload models which will serve to create a data base of information on aerodynamic and control characteristics and yield insights into construction techniques and operational aspects which are, to a degree, scalable up through the envisioned larger vehicles. As many as four contractors will be funded up to $2.5M each to produce and demonstrate their individual designs with first flight goals of one year from contract award (to occur in FY-04).  Additionally, the selected participants will be expected to produce conceptual pre-designs of 30 and 500 ton HULAs for which the data from their model demonstrations has application. The HULA project Industry Day is Thursday, 5 June,  2003 at Patuxent River, MD.  The meeting will be held at the Titan facility in Lexington Park beginning at 0900, scheduled to end by noon. Notification of intent to participate and Inquiries may be directed to:  huettse@navair.navy.mil or cmyersaero@aol.com. Following the NAVAIR presentations and exchange of views, the industrial participants are invited to submit comments and suggestions or questions, not to exceed five pages, regarding the proposed competitive program.  Comments should be received by 15 June.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN “UNRESTRICTED” BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  This procurement will result in the award of up to four (4) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) design-build Construction Contracts general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facilities, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction (grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, and community support type facilities for activities in Pensacola, Milton, and Panama City Regional Areas of the State of Florida managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  Naval Air Station Pensacola and outlying airfields; Corry Station; Naval Surface Warfare Center Coastal Systems Station Panama City; Naval Air Station Whiting Field, and outlying airfields in the Panhandle of North West Florida.    Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, cost or price or other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million. Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of 3 to 7 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), Management Approach and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including (new construction and renovation) but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements civil construction grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 7 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each see project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the see projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the best overall proposal(s) for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project(s) have been removed from further competition.   A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s) where a seed project is not awarded.  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ contract, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  The seed project(s) for this solicitation are unconfirmed at this time.  Due to funding constraints, authorization to advertise see project(s) is not expected until after the Phase I portion of this solicitation is completed.  It is possible that no seed project(s) will be authorized during this fiscal year and Phase II competition would be postponed until at least one suitable seed project is identified.  FOR SPECIFICATIONS:  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 05 May 2003 with Phase I Proposals being due 04 June 2003. PHASE II WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has issued a solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) for research and development efforts from members of the photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. "PV Manufacturing R & D—Large-Scale Module and Component Yield, Durability, and Reliability” requests Letters of Interest (LOIs) from individual or teamed U.S. PV and related industries to address a range of topics relating to the manufacture of PV modules, components and systems. The proposed work areas may include, but will not be limited to, issues such as improvement of module manufacturing processes to increase module reliability; system and system component packaging, system integration, manufacturing and assembly; product manufacturing flexibility; and balance-of-system development including storage and quality control. The primary focus is the enhancement of module, system component, and complete system reliability.
As photovoltaic technology becomes better positioned to be a more significant contributor to the world’s electricity generation mix, the reliability of the technology will be a key factor in the acceptance of the technology by utilities and other end users. Although PV systems are much simpler than many conventional generation technologies, PV systems still consist of a number of electrical and mechanical components that must be manufactured and subsequently integrated into a complete system. This variety of electronic and mechanical components, once assembled into a system, represent a system that must provide high-quality, reliable power. As the market demand for PV modules and systems has grown, NREL and the PV industry have partnered, through the PV Manufacturing R & D project, to ensure that the growing markets can be served. In addition to simply meeting demand, this partnership took a significant step in the Project’s sixth solicitation to address product yield and quality by supporting the introduction of intelligent process controls into manufacturing lines. This solicitation endeavors to take a second, more significant and deliberate step in supporting the PV industry in ensuring that production volume increases are matched by increases in product quality and therefore field reliability. It is the intention of this request for Letters of Interest to address reliability issues related to PV modules, module manufacturing, and BOS components individually. This request for LOIs will also address design and reliability issues related to complete PV systems ranging from residential rooftop systems to large-scale utility deployments that address the markets reflected in the growing number of state-level renewable portfolio standards.
Full text of the solicitation will be available on the NREL website, http://www.nrel.gov/contracts/index.html on or after April 21, 2003.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Robertson, Contract Specialist, Phone (202)366-4004, Fax (202)366-3705, Email cheryl.robertson@fhwa.dot.gov
<DESC>In the months following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Transportation Review Board (TRB) jointly conducted a security and emergency response survey of all State DOTs to help them assess vulnerability and preparedness.  The results of this survey indicated that 59% of the respondents had some surveillance capabilities on their bridges.  In order to better secure our structures, this number needs to be increased and the type of surveillance technologies upgraded.  The States are also overwhelmed by new technologies available for implementation, but lack the appropriate guidelines for choosing the technologies that will effectively secure our bridges and tunnels against terrorism.  The State transportation agencies and other private bridge operators (e.g. railroads) are seeking a menu of options for increasing surveillance and security of vulnerable structures.  The State highway agencies need better information on cost, effectiveness, design and applicability of state of the art technologies such as closed circuit cameras, electronic detection, monitoring, tracking and alarm systems, or security patrols.

The AASHTO Task Force on Transportation Security identified the need for this research as a priority.   It is also a step towards meeting FHWA’s goals to ensure the security of the transportation system for the movement of people and goods and of improving highway safety.  In order to assist the states and meet the goals, the Federal Highway Administration is initiating a national pooled fund study to identify state of the art surveillance and security technologies for bridges and tunnels.  

The state of the art technologies for bridge and tunnel surveillance identified in this study should assist the States in decision making and provide guidelines to determine the benefits of new technologies with the ultimate goal of improving the existing level of security.  The FHWA anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with a 12 month period of performance.  This requirement is considered a 100% small business set-aside pursuant to NAICS code 541690.

The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about 8 May 2003 by posting it on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) website, http://www.eps.gov.  No written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  The proposal due date will be 30 days after the solicitation is posted.  The estimated award date is 10 Jul 2003.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for both the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(ii)	Solicitation #RFQ-17-03-050
(iii)	The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #13.
(iv)	Not set aside.
(v)	Line Item #1.  Furnish and Install Multi-line Dispatch Console, 1 Each
(vi)	General:  The contractor shall furnish and install a fully-functional multi-line remote control dispatch console system for use by the INYO NATIONAL FOREST in a two-way mobile radio system—including, but not limited to, all equipment, material, parts, labor, and site-specific software programming.  The dispatch console system shall be comprised of multiple operator positions sharing a common electronics package and shall provide all the necessary functions to operate conventional FM two-way radio base or repeater stations and provide control and/or communications of paging systems, alarms, devices and other ancillary equipment.
1.	Equipment shall be new and currently in production.
2.	The system described shall be wired for four Communications Control Operator Positions.
3.	The Communications Control Center Console shall utilize touch screen color monitor and mouse control technology for the user interface.
4.	The system shall be wired to control seventeen base station radios, but be equipped for thirty-two radios.
5.	The system shall be wired to control six analog loop-start phone lines, but be equipped for twelve lines.
6.	The only parts required to expand from the equipped capacity to the wired capacity shall be plug in cards, wiring and operator positions.  
7.	Each position will require a dual monitor card and two 18.1” or larger LCD Touch screens--one for radio operation and one for telephone. 
8.	The system shall employ a 256 port non-blocking Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) digital audio switch.  
9.	Consoles shall be capable of displaying a repeater/tone name upon receiving an ASCII message.  To identify the repeater in use a CTCSS to ASCII decoder will be used (supplied by the Forest).  This ASCII signature must be translated to the appropriate ASCII display on the console.  This will take the form of the repeater name blinking on one of the buttons on the display.
10.	The system shall be fully user programmable as regards to system, Operator Position, base station, and user interface configuration.  All aspects of the configuration shall be available to local customer service personnel.  All configuration settings shall be available through any operator position without the need for PROM replacement or the use of an external PC (personal computer).  This includes both screen programming features and radio interface settings.  Separate programming from a central electronics unit will not be acceptable. The system shall be capable of accepting configuration changes made from an off-site personal computer. 
11.	In order to take advantage of future requirements, the software shall be written in a language compatible with a Microsoft networked operating system application.  The operating system environment will allow us to perform multi-tasking with other programs that are suitable to run with a real time system such as this dispatch communications program.  
12.	The system must be able to employ digital audio from the microphone to the control lines in order to insure maximum resistance to analog interference and the highest quality audio.  The interface between the console positions and the common electronics shall be T1 requiring only two pairs of wires.  It shall be possible to use a dedicated cable, in-house category 5 LAN cable, or existing telephone wiring to connect an operator position to the common electronics.  The operator positions shall be DC isolated from the common electronics to eliminate ground loops. 
13.	E911 telephone capability may be implemented in the future by simply adding telephone hardware to the existing common equipment.  
14.	The contractor shall provide free operator position and system card software updates for the life of the system.  These updates shall include but not be limited to all software bug fixes, configuration enhancement, and features added to the software.  The updates shall also include all software features added to meet newer customer requirements.  These new features shall be capable of being activated free of charge with a simple configuration change at Inyo National Forest's discretion.  The latest version of system software shall be available for download 24 hours a day via an Internet World Wide Web site free of charge.  These updates shall be a complete version including all the configuration software along with software to simulate the operation of the user interface per configuration changes.  All of the before mentioned software shall also be available on floppy disk or CD-ROM free of charge.  The software updates shall not include updates to the operating system.  
15.	The contractor shall be able to furnish replacement parts and service for the console system over the life of the system.
16.	The contractor shall make available technical system on a phone-in basis during normal hours.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include an additional clause, provide guidance on price proposals, and to amend section 3.3.4 in the SOW.  

1.	The following clause will hereby be incorporated into the solicitation and consequently into the resulting purchase order:
Contract Invoicing
The Contractor shall only invoice the Government for the actual number of hours worked on this effort in accordance with the rates / pricing established between the Government and the successful contractor by the resulting purchase order.  All funds remaining on the order prior to the close of each fiscal year will be deobligated from this order. 

2.	The contractor is encouraged to submit pricing information based on a total firm fixed hourly rate.  However, all price proposals that meet the requirements of this solicitation will be considered.
 
3.	Section 3.3.4 of the SOW is hereby amended as follows:
FROM:  
The contractor will participate as medical consultant or attending physician in emergency management, short-term care, and follow-up of any laboratory acquired infection as needed and requested by Associate Director for RML.  The contractor will respond to accidental exposures in this capacity within 2 hours when requested by the Associate Director for RML.
TO:
The contractor will participate as medical consultant or attending physician in emergency management, short-term care, and follow-up of any laboratory acquired infection as needed and requested by Associate Director for RML.  The contractor will respond to accidental exposures in this capacity within 2 hours when requested by the Associate Director for RML. The Government will not accept a real-time, virtual presence, as through telemedicine or videoconferencing as a substitute for an actual presence.  It is essential that the physician be able to be present, in person, and not in some sort of virtual format. Any situations that develop are likely to involve acute exposure to serious infectious disease agents. Consequently, direct on-site evaluation and physical examination will be crucial to assessing the problem and making recommendations for treatment, medications, therapies and follow-up. 

4.	The closing date and time of this solicitation remains unchanged at this time. 

5.	All other terms and conditions of this solicitation remain unchanged. 

6.	All questions, inquires or responses to this amendment must be submitted to Leona Eschenbacher, at (406) 363-9395 or via email at: leschenbacher@niaid.nih.gov prior to 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight time.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office,= requires the deactivation and environmental restoration of the Fast Flux Test Facili= ty (FFTF), a 400 megawatt liquid metal cooled test reactor.  The reactor, which has not operated since 1992, is located on the Hanford Site near Richla= nd, WA. It is DOE?s intention to accomplish this acquisition as a total small business set-aside.  Accordingly, the purpose of this announcement is to solicit= expressions of interest from qualified small businesses or consortiums = of small businesses capable of performing a majority of the work.  Substantial subcontracting to large businesses is permitted provided not less than = 51% of the total work is performed by small businesses..  Note:  If more than = one firm will be involved, be sure to include the capabilities of the other firm= s and identify which aspects of the work will be performed by each firm. Business arrangements to perform the work include: =B7 A single small business performs a majority of the work on its own = as a prime contractor. =B7 An affiliation/team of small businesses performs the entire or majo= rity portion of the work as a prime contractor; or =B7 A single or affiliation/team of small businesses join with a large business entity (or entities) to perform the work (provided small businesses per= form not less than 51% of the work). This acquisition is classified under North American Industry Classifica= tion System (NAICS) Code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, size standard 500 employees. Summary Description of the FFTF Closure Project: The activities required to achieve the closure of the FFTF can generall= y be grouped into facility deactivation, sodium disposition, and facility decommissioning.  The scope of each of these activities is individually= described below.  Currently, only the deactivation and sodium dispositi= on activities are authorized.  Specific facility decommissioning activitie= s will be defined after a formal regulatory decision process.  However, the schedule for this work is expected to be fully integrated.  The project includes=  the deactivation, sodium disposition and facility decommissioning of the FF= TF plant and the general-purpose support buildings located within the 400 Area o= f the Hanford site. Facility Deactivation:  Deactivation will remove from the FFTF 169 irradiated fuel components stored in sodium filled fuel storage vessels and packag= e them for approved storage.  An additional 18 interim storage casks containin= g irradiated fuel are to be relocated to alternate storage on the Hanford= Site. The FFTF Closure Project does not include the ultimate disposition of t= he fuel.  Deactivation will also involve the removal of approximately 260,= 000 gallons of liquid metal (mostly sodium) from the reactor systems, the t= wo fuel storage vessels, and their auxiliary systems.  The FFTF plant, associat= ed support buildings, and associated operating systems and equipment are t= o be deactivated and prepared for decommissioning. Sodium Disposition: The 260,000 gallons of bulk sodium is to be dispositioned. Any environmentally compliant approach to this task is acceptable.  The= contractor will have the option of transferring the bulk sodium to Argo= nne National Laboratory -West (ANL-W) Sodium Processing Facility in Idaho t= o be converted to sodium hydroxide and subsequent return and use of the converted material by the DOE Office of River Protection in the treatment of high-level tank waste at Hanford.  The residual sodium is also to be removed from = the plant systems and appropriately dispositioned. Facility Decommissioning: The buildings comprising the FFTF closure pro= ject are to be demolished.  A decision on the final end state of the FFTF site h= as not been made.  Alternatives range from removal of contaminated structures = and equipment for disposal in another area of the Hanford Site to demolitio= n and entombment in place. Estimated Value The estimated value of the contemplated acquisition is more than $500 million. Content of Responses The purpose of this notice is to ascertain the extent of interest and capability of the small business community related to the contemplated acquisition.  Large businesses should not respond to this announcement,=  but may consider teaming with a small business or consortium of small businesse= s. Interested small businesses are requested to submit a Statement of Capability including the following information: =B7 Name of firm(s) (including address(es)) =B7 Point of Contact (name, telephone number and e-mail address) =B7 Small business status of the firm(s) =B7 Relevant experience of the firm(s) within the last five years to th= e requirements of this project =B7 Capabilities of the firm(s) to perform the contemplated work. The Statements of Capability are not intended to be proposals, but rath= er the information will be used by DOE in determining the viability of setting= aside this acquisition for small business.

<SUBJECT>D -- Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (JWID) 2004
<DESC>1.  This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2004 (JWID 2004) scheduled for 1-25 Jun 2004.  The focus for JWID 2004 is on coalition interoperability, Homeland Defense (HLD), and Homeland Security (HLS).  Combatant commands, Services and Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DOD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States must submit coalition interoperability trial (CIT) proposals for JWID 2004 by 1 October 2003.  Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DOD to submit CITs.  Complete details on JWID 2004, to include the format and submission instructions for CITs, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil.
2. JWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, and computers (C4) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  The intent is to conduct trials of C4 capabilities during JWID that can then be moved into operational use in the near term.  Trials are not only limited to evaluations of hardware or software solutions.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technology are just as important as the solutions themselves and further investigations into these areas using JWID as a vehicle are encouraged.  The USJFCOM J86I Joint Interoperability and Integration (JI&I) process will be the primary method used to responsibly field promising technologies to fit warfighter requirements. 
3. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is the host combatant command for JWID 2004.  Consequently, the scenario for JWID 2004 will incorporate aspects of HLD and HLS in addition to traditional coalition operations.  USNORTHCOM tentatively plans to include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Coast Guard in JWID 2004 (subject to coordination with those agencies).  USNORTHCOM intends to use JWID as a proving ground for emerging C4 technologies relevant to HLD and HLS.  Coalition participation remains an important part of JWID and will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations.  In addition, all combatant commanders may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective area-of-responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 
4. JWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for validation of C4 solutions.  Each CIT will receive a comprehensive assessment.  Depending on the CIT, the assessment may include a warfighter/operator, technical/interoperability, and security assessment.  Trials with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO.   Use of other information domains over other networks to support participation of additional nations and the information flow required for the HLS/HLD portion of the scenario depends on which other nations and which U.S. government agencies participate.  The JWID Joint Management Office (JMO) coordinates, engineers and supervises the network backbone(s), information domains and the worldwide venue, and provides the CIT assessments.  
5. Each proposed CIT must address one or more of the JWID 2004 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  By submitting a trial proposal, the submitter commits to fully resource the CIT (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, etc.) for JWID 2004 at a minimum of one JWID site.  Industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DOD.  CIT proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the JWID web site.  The JWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific CIT proposals for execution by 7 November 2003 given projected availability of resources, how well the CIT dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the JWID web site.  USNORTHCOM will provide an initial determination on those CITs related to HLD/HLS.
6. The Joint Staff J-6, in coordination with USNORTHCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for JWID 2004 from the Unified Commands (via United States Joint Forces Command), NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.  A short summary of the eight specific JWID 2004 objectives follows.
a.	Provide solutions to facilitate information sharing across multiple information domains that include defense and other government agencies.  Explanation:  Multiple information domains exist today across a coalition operation to include inter-agency needs.  Today's operational information sharing requires interoperable flexible, faster and secure means to electronically connect these domains.  USNORTHCOM requires the capability to share information with HLS agencies bridging current network architectures (Multi level security/Security across information domains).  
b.	Provide an enhanced interoperable situation awareness capability, scalable in both time and scope within and between information domains.  Explanation:  Situational awareness requirements are dependent on the ultimate user's needs.  The consequence is that any situational awareness capability must expand or contract to support those needs.  Delivery of situational awareness information must be available to the user regardless of information domain membership and must be tailored to the user's needs.  USNORTHCOM requires the capability to automatically input and receive data on the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) from all HLS and DOD agencies.  Solutions presented should address system integration and data conversion issues.  (Situational Awareness).
c.	Provide enhanced methods to fuse and protect information contained in dissimilar databases maintained by coalition and national defense and government agencies.  Explanation:  Users must be able to securely access, extract, and utilize information contained within dissimilar databases across multiple information domains.  Information from within these databases must remain secure while in-transit or in rest.  While long-term capabilities will focus on adoption of common database structures/schemas, a short-term solution to permit translation between existing databases is essential.  USNORTHCOM requires the capability to use object oriented solutions to encrypt data vice using existing guarding technology to share data with agencies.  (Database Fusion).
d.	Provide solutions to permit enhanced sharing/dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) products within and across coalition and inter-agency information domains.  Explanation:  There is an increasing requirement to share and disseminate ISR products to multiple information domains operating at multiple levels of security.  The members of these domains may include coalition military participants, agencies and other governmental organizations not traditionally associated with a coalition military operation.  (ISR Dissemination).
e.	Provide solutions to address in-transit security of information being shared within and between fixed information environments and mobile/tactical users.  Explanation:  End users and/or first responders require interoperable secure wireless technology to receive and transmit critical information, voice, data, and video to all levels of participation across the coalition and national environment.  (Wireless Security).
f.	Provide solutions to monitor and defend against threats to multiple information domains.  Explanation:  Information systems and network defense require additional solutions that can span multiple information domains, operating at multiple levels of security.  (Coalition Network Defense).
g.	Provide solutions to create a fused logistical status including information feeds from multiple information domains.  Explanation:  Logistic information availability across coalition participants requires access to multiple data sources.  Access to the information implies combining total asset visibility and information on transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information domains.  (Logistics Systems).
h.	Provide language translation tools to enable effective coalition and inter-agency operations.  Explanation:  Coalition operations may involve multiple nations and organizations that do not use a common language.  Tools to translate documents, displays and written/audio-exchanges with planners and end-users is a requirement of operations at the military, agency and other government organization levels.  (Language Translation).
7.  Subject to changes, the following milestones are to be used for planning purposes:
a.	Coalition Interoperability Trial proposals due - 1 Oct 2003.
b.	Initial Planning Conference - 17-21 November 2003, tidewater area VA.

(3)	Trials assessment and visitors - 14-24 June 2004.
(4)	Hot Wash - 25 June 2004.
8.  Administrative requirements:
a.	All information submitted will be considered and handled as non-proprietary.  
b.	Unclassified and classified networks will be used.  US DOD CIT participants will require a minimum of DOD SECRET clearance to participate in JWID 2004.  The principal DOD information domain that CITs will use will be at a combined SECRET-releasable security level.  
c.	Military or government civilian personnel will operate the CIT during assessments.  CITs must provide required training at each JWID 2004 site where their CIT is located.  JWID funds will not be provided for training.
d.	CITs will be required to provide on-site technical and operational representation throughout all JWID 2004 planning conferences and execution phases.  JWID funds will not be used.
9.  The JWID JMO point of contact is LCDR Mike Ward, 757-225-2153 (DSN 575) OR E-MAIL:  mike.ward@langley.af.mil.  Please refer to the JWID web site for specific information about CIT proposal submissions.  
10.  With its focus on HLD/HLS and coalition interoperability, JWID will play a large part in improving information sharing between coalition partners and between the DOD, government agencies supporting Homeland Defense and Security, and non-government agencies.

The contractor shall deliver all line items FOB Destination, to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.  Delivery shall be no later than 90 days ARO.  Line Item 0003: On-site installation and demonstration prior to acceptance of equipment.  This shall be scheduled with the Technical Information Contact and shall be completed not later than two (2) weeks after delivery of the equipment at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland; Quantity one (1) job: Installation shall include the following: Uncrate, hook-up, set-up and demonstration.  For the demonstration, the Contractor must clearly demonstrate that their system shall deliver the pulse duration and output power specifications required by NIST.  NIST will supply a <20 fs, >65 nm bandwidth seed laser (Kapteyn-Murnane Ti:sapphire) running at 250 microjoules average power at 800 nm and 80 MHz.   Output pulse duration (<30 fs required) shall be demonstrated after installation using a vendor-supplied autocorrelator cross-checked for calibration against a NIST autocorrelator.   The regenerative amplifier output power will be measured using vendor and NIST calibrated power meters as a function of input power delivered by a diode-pumped Evolution X laser (up to 10 mJ/pulse at 1 KHz).  If the vendor can demonstrate output beam shape and divergence with a beam analyzer that is preferred.  Measurement of these and other output beam parameters listed as required specifications would then be made by NIST during a two-week testing period before full acceptance can occur.  Note that the Government will consider making a partial payment of no more than 33% of the total price upon delivery of the equipment and in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.   A payment of the remaining balance will be made upon completion of installation, demonstration of the specifications, acceptance by the Government, receipt of a proper invoice, and in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.
