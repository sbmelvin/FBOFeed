<DESC>The US Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to award a sole source purchase order as a sponsoring Federal Agency to the Colorado School of Mines, Center for Welding, Joining and Coatings (CSM) for the following tasks in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The purpose of this Joint Industry Project (JIP)  is to determine the hydrogen damage susceptibility of high strength steel used in the offshore Oil & Gas pipeline transportation system due to magnetization under realistic conditions of MFL inspection experienced in the field. This study is largely based on the findings as a result of the previous program.  It is proposed to experimentally understand and characterize the behavior of thick, high strength pipeline steels under simulated field conditions with respect to: (a)  Steel strength of the pipe (b)  Stresses in different directions of pipes due to: (i)  Residual cold work stress (pipe formation) (ii)  Surface damage (operation) (iii)  Fluid pressure (c)  Hydrogen activity due to: (i)  Cathodic protection (ii)  Steel environment: soil (iii)  Steel environment: pipe fluid (d)  Temperature (e)  Remnant magnetism in steels after pigging as a function of time. The simulated values for (a)-(e) in the laboratory shall be those that are experienced in the field. The research project will quantitatively measure the hydrogen induced cracking susceptibility and aqueous corrosion of steel under these simulated conditions.  The MMS will provide sponsorship funding in the amount of $99,498.00 for a two year period of performance.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541690 "Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services." This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received by the POC listed below by close of business March 23, 2006, will be considered by the government.  POC: Kimberly Luke, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2100, Herndon, VA 20170.  Questions must be emailed to Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov or faxed to Kimberly Luke at 703-787-1041.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award on a sole source basis with the Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University, specifically Dr. Brian Bledsoe.  Reclamation has a requirement for a study to quickly and accurately assess the geomorphologic and biologic impacts of river regimes at Reclamation owned and operated facilities.  The full project has been scoped through a Fiscal Year 2005 scoping grant by the Science and Technology Office and preliminarily developed with software named GeoTools developed and owned by Brian Bledsoe at the Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University. In order to complete the project requires models and modeling techniques in a time frame that cannot be accomplished by the TSC Flood Hydrology Group.  The methods and analyses must be state-of-the-art and technically sound. DESCRIPTION OF WORK The specific tasks that will be accomplished as part of this project are: -The implementation of Indicators of Hydrologic Analysis within the GeoTools Environment, - Coordination with the Flood Hydrology group on the collection of cross-sectional data and sediment data on the North Platte and / or Yakima River systems where biological information has previously been collected. - Validation of GeoTools with more complex studies that are either underway or have previously been completed.  This includes the development of a HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model of the Yakima and / or North Platte Rivers above and below Reclamation facilities. - Analyze, statistically, the relationship between the aquatic invertebrates and stream flow metrics (hydraulic and hydrologic); and validate this analysis with biologic data previously collected by the TSC. - Coordinate with the TSC and Reclamation regions to improve and refine GeoTools interface options and outputs (including graphical outputs for comparing management scenarios). - The reports should be in the form of peer reviewed publications and one report in the format of Reclamation's Visual Identity Protocol.  David Raff will assist and coordinate with the vendor to put the information into this format. The validation products relating to case studies of hydraulic variables, the completion of the software development, documentation and user manuals will be completed by September 2007.     The remainder of the project and will be completed by the end of September 2007.  This includes the remainder of the validations, the statistical analysis and the coordination with the TSC and regional staff.  The deliverables will also be completed and transmitted. The vendor will have check in meetings with the government on a bi-weekly basis.

Contract NAS5-03111 expires on April 11, 2006 and the proposed contract extension will be for a 6-month period from April 12, 2006 through September 11, 2006.	The current contract was awarded to the SAO as a sole-source, noncompetitive procurement. Contract NAS5-03111 provides the international liaison and leadership services for the development and implementation of joint programs in satellite laser ranging and other space geodesy techniques.  Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) is one of the fundamental techniques for measurement and understanding of plate tectonics, regional crustal deformation, Earth rotation and orientation, the spatial and temporal details of the gravity field, global climate, and in the measurement of fundamental physical constants.  SLR also provides the high accuracy, global tracking coverage required for the fullest interpretation of satellite altimetry data for monitoring ocean dynamics and circulation through the details of ocean surface topography.  SLR currently supports satellite missions by generating orbit predictions and collecting tracking data.	The tracking data is used for these satellites precise orbit determination that enables sensor calibration and gravity studies to be performed. Specifically, SAO has 40 years of experience in Satellite Laser Ranging, developing instrumentation, deployment of field systems, and analysis and interpretation of data.  SAO is world-renowned in technical and organizational experience.  SAO is respected worldwide for a long history of organizing international satellite tracking activities.  The SAO network was absorbed into NASA’s network in the early 1980’s.  A 6-month no-cost extension to Contract NAS5-03111 is necessary due to a delay in awarding the follow-on sole source contract to SAO for the same services for the next 5 years.	The period of the extension is from April 12, 2006 through September 11, 2006 and it will be performed within the original estimated cost of the contract. Due to this delay and SAO’s experience in this field, the Contracting Officer has determined that the Government’s requirement for the SLR services and international SLR support cannot be obtained from any other source for the contract extension.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 23, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>This notice serves to announce that USAID/Bolivia will be issuing a request for quotes. The intent of this solicitation will be to seek quotes from qualified Organizations or individuals with demonstrated expertise to conduct a USAID/Mission Inclusion Retreat. In December 2005, USAID/Bolivia completed development of its “Strategic Plan for Promoting Diversity, Inclusion and Equality of Opportunity”.  In brief, it provides an initial road map for how the Mission can do a better job promoting inclusion of indigenous peoples in its activities, including in Mission staffing (e.g. professional staff on the technical teams) and programming, to improve its ability to accomplish the goal of promoting “sustained and equitable development under democratic rule of law”.   While the indigenous in Bolivia are the majority of the country’s population they have been historically marginalized socially, politically and economically.  This is reflected in the extremely poor social indicators that characterize these populations and in the country’s chronic instability.  The Mission Inclusion Committee has identified the need for a Mission retreat to officially “launch” the implementation of the strategy and to promote Mission-wide buy-in to its vision. The contractor shall work with the Mission Inclusion Committee to provide assistance in familiarizing the new Strategy to all Mission staff and preparing them for its implementation.  Though some emphasis of the retreat will focus on the “why” of why this initiative is important to the Mission: i.e., current Bolivian context, sharing of common value of diversity in the Mission, etc… the primary focus of the retreat should very much be on the “how” of how the Mission will implement the strategy.   Key information and training elements in support of Strategy themes should also be included as part of this retreat.  The estimated period of performance must be initiated by o/a April 17th, 2006 and be completed o/a May 26, 2006. Specific dates for the intervention will be negotiated with the contractor once staffing is proposed and accepted by the Mission.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Tulsa Veterans Center is contracting for Veterans Readjustment Counseling Services.  The contractor shall furnish readjustment-counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Vet Center staff members or professional staff members of VA Psychiatry, Social Work, Psychology or Nursing Services. Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, is counseling-provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other qualified counselors, individually or in groups, specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties specifically, related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, educational pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.  Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group, and family counseling all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of Vietnam era and/or post-Vietnam war zone veterans. This service does not include general mental health services but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment-from military duty for example:       a. Exposure to combat-related war trauma.       b. Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress. c. Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by DSM-III-R) and/or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.       d.  Stresses unique to military duty for eligible veterans.       e. Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.   f. Substance abuse connected with military duty post-war homecoming and readjustment.       g. Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful re-entry into civilian roles.     h. Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.       i. Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational and/or vocational activities.       j. Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge. The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract mechanism.  Nonetheless offerors should have the capability through referral .to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications-and/or other medical treatment.  Veteran consumers should be advised that VA will not reimburse through this service for physical examinations, drugs, or other medical treatments.  In all such cases, VA medical facilities should be the priority referral for the veteran's medical care.  When this is not feasible due to geographical distance, VA Fee Basis providers should also be considered.  The contract provider should coordinate with the COTR for assistance in facilitating referrals to VA medical providers. Providers are to physically located with in the city limits of McAlester, Oklahoma. Requests for solicitations shall be in writing and addressed to Contracting Officer (90c), Muskogee VAMC, 1011 Honor Heights Drive, Muskogee, OK 74401

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision “... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ...”  The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions. The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities, extending both to fixed shore facilities and to highly mobile air, surface, land and subsurface platforms, including the so-called “disadvantaged user” (e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, dispersed ground units in RF challenged environments, etc.).  The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 312) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance the connectivity among such widely dispersed naval, joint, allied and coalition forces.

<b>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT #DTPH56-06-BAA-0001 </b>
<p>
This FedBizOpps notice constitutes the BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  
<p>
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) does not expect to award more than $250,000 in funding to any single research project, or to award more than $1,000,000 in funding over the life of the program described in this BAA.  Additional levels of funding may be available if warranted with all funds contingent on Congressional approval.  
<p>
A technical evaluation panel will review all white papers received for responsiveness to the evaluation areas stated in this BAA.  An offeror providing a white paper deemed worthy of further consideration and meeting the criteria of this BAA will be notified with possible suggestions for change in scope and detailed guidelines for submitting a full proposal.  Each full proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's total cost to be considered.
<p>
The Government's technical staff will not hold any discussion with an offeror after submission of a white paper without the Contracting Officer's prior approval.  PHMSA encourages the widest participation, particularly involvement with universities and other academic institutions, as well as with individuals, corporations, non-profit organizations, small and small disadvantaged businesses, and State or local governments or other entities.
<p><br>

<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<p>
PHMSA conducted an Advanced Coatings Research & Development (R&D) workshop for Pipelines and Related Facilities in Gaithersburg, Maryland on June 9-10, 2005.  The 1.5 day event included approximately 60 representatives from Federal, State and international government agencies, public representatives, research funding organizations, standards organizations, and pipeline operators from the U.S. and Canada.  The Coatings Workshop led to a common understanding of current research efforts, a listing of key challenges facing government and industry, and a compilation of potential research areas whose exploration can help meet these challenges and therefore be considered in the development of new R&D applications.  Only those topics described in the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and identified at the Coatings Workshop will be addressed.  Not all topics identified at the Coatings Workshop fit within PHMSA’s mission and therefore may not be represented in this BAA.  Information on the research topics identified can be found in the Advanced Coatings Workshop proceedings and the technical report-out presentations.  To view these proceedings and presentations, please visit http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_060905.htm .

PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects that address the following pipeline safety program areas.  Additional details about the intent of these research topics are found within the proceedings and working group report-outs at http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_060905.htm .
<p>
<b>1. Coating Integrity</b>
<p>
Address the lack of knowledge on the role coating parameters play with failure mechanisms when linked to coating disbondment.  Items for the investigation could include identification of appropriate surface profile/preparation to reduce coatings disbondment.  The impact of manufacturing extrusion process for multi-layer coatings towards the residual stresses could also be investigated.  Project results could identify and assess potential coating disbondment and how the above properties can be measured.  The research team members could include technology developers, coating appliers, pipeline operators and if appropriate, standards development organizations.
<p>
<b>2. Coating Application</b>
<p>
Address the role preheat temperature plays on strain hardening behaviour of steel pipe (important for strain based design.)  The project could also address abrasive blast cleaning on Stress Corrosion Cracking resistance and any other resulting effects. Project results should identify and develop protocols on how the coating application process affects the properties of steel pipes.  The research team members could include technology developers, coating appliers, pipeline operators and if appropriate, standards development organizations.
<p>
<b>3. Disbonded Coating Identification</b>  
<p>
Develop advanced technologies or techniques for identifying disbonded coatings and shielding locations for new and existing pipes.  Project results could drive improvements in existing, or create new, technologies and techniques for identifying disbonded coatings and shielding locations for new and existing pipes.  The research scope should quantify any advancement over existing technology or techniques.  Field tests using realistic operating conditions could be employed to benchmark application of the proposed technology or technique.  The research team members could include technology developers, coating appliers, pipeline operators and if appropriate, standards development organizations.
<p>
<b>4. In-field Welding and Coating Coordinated Activities</b>
<p>
Address the interactions between in-field welding and field applied pipe coatings.  A project could survey existing approaches and practices that welders utilize and develop protocols that could affect the integrity and quality of field applied coatings.  The research could include welded joints, hot taps, and service repairs to the pipeline.  Project results could improve communications between welders and coating applicators in the field.  The research team members could include technology developers, coating appliers, pipeline operators and if appropriate, standards development organizations.
<p>
In addition, each research topic must have with the following attributes:
<p>
1)	Can produce results in the short-term (1-3 years).<br>			
2) 	Are progressed successfully past the proof of concept.<br>
3) 	Can contribute to the development of technology or strengthening of consensus standards or provides general knowledge for decision makers.<br>
<p><br>
<b>WHITE PAPERS</b>
<p>
PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects that address the above specified pipeline safety program areas.  
<p>
Each proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost to be considered.  
<p>
Each white paper should be no more than five pages and include the following: 1) a description of the state-of-the-art in the area being proposed; 2) actions proposed to advance that state with a quantifiable method to measure the improvement anticipated upon completion of the project; 3) examples of past performance that demonstrates the ability of an offeror to compete further from white papers to proposals; and 4) examples, if any, of prior awarded research with DOT.    
<p>
Each white paper must include the following contact information: point of contact, organization name and complete street address, organization DUNS number, organization Tax Identification Number (TIN), telephone number, fax number, and email address.
<p>
The entire white paper submission package, including the White Paper itself (5 pages maximum), and <b>all attachments, appendices and backup materials, should not exceed a total of fifteen pages.</b>
<p>
The package must include sufficient information to evaluate the following areas:
<p>
I.	<b>Offeror’s understanding and description of the "state of the art" in the proposed research area:</b>  The degree to which the offeror identifies the current status of the technology in the research area it is proposing to address, including previous work done by the offeror and others in the proposed R&D area and appropriateness of how the prior work relates to the proposed application of the technology. Adequacy and feasibility of the applicant’s approach to achieving stated objectives must be clarified.
	<p>
II.	<b>Scientific and technical merit of proposal to advance pipeline safety:</b> The degree to which the proposed technology or methodology is based on sound scientific and engineering principles as well as the degree to which the proposal will advance pipeline safety if the project is successfully completed. 
	<p>
III.	<b>Adequacy and feasibility of technical approach and realism of cost estimate:</b> Appropriateness, rationale, and completeness of the applicant's technical approach. The adequacy of the proposed project schedule, staffing plan and planned travel to complete the proposed project. The realism of the cost estimate to meet objectives and deliver products in the proposed timeline. The likelihood that the proposed project will be successful and develop a new successful technology. 
	<p>
IV.	<b>Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in Federal research programs:</b>  Credentials, capabilities and experience of key personnel. Demonstrated corporate experience of the applicant and participating organizations in managing similar projects that are similar to the proposal in size, complexity, and technology are evaluated as is the adequacy of the facilities and equipment to perform project tasks.
	<p>
V.	<b>Timeline to implement proposed technologies or concepts into practice into the pipeline industry:</b>  Overall potential timeline of the proposed technology to become an accepted commercial product if the project is successfully completed.
	<p>
VI.	<b>State of the application and coordination and collaboration with end users to implement proposed technologies or concepts into the pipeline industry:</b> (Criterion to be used only during full proposal evaluation) If applicable, the proposed research should identify whether the deliverable addresses technology or consensus standards. The offeror could include scope items that coordinate with standard organizations and or vendor technology organizations to increase the chance that project results will be applied or commercialized. Items such as invitations to project meetings, providing copies of milestone reports and drafting project outputs in formats recognized with that organization are suggested. The offeror could provide clarity, logic and likely effectiveness of project organization including subcontractors to successfully complete the project.
	<p>
	
	<b>All evaluation factors are of equal importance.</b>

The redesign will eliminate obsolete tester components and eliminate the need for any secondary EU system level testing through incorporation of simulated JHMCS prime mission hardware.  Successful completion will include the production of two new redesigned EU test sets and re-baseline of the EU acceptance test procedure.  Anticipated final delivery is 18 months after receipt of contract.  Upgrade of the existing inventory of EU Testers will be incorporated by use of priced contract options.

The enhanced system will provide improved production efficiencies by lowering test cycle times and multiplying production throughput capability by a factor of two.  Successful completion will include the production of two new redesigned DU test sets and re-baseline of the EU acceptance test procedure.  Anticipated final delivery is 18 months after receipt of contract.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administrtion (NASA)Ames Research Center plans to procure services to support NASA Ames development of key air traffic services for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), as defined by the Joint Planning Development Office (JPDO). These services include; conduct of joint research and development for Oceanic Tailored Arrivals, and, evaluation and analysis of NAS-Wide capacity enhancement initiatives.  NASA/ARC has a requirement for development of air traffic management systems to support Oceanic Tailored Arrivals. NASA Ames and The Boeing Company are conducting the Oceanic Tailored Arrivals (OTA) collaborative research and development project, with airline partnership and FAA support. This project is an initial step in development of concepts and air traffic management systems for eventual implementation of Tailored Arrivals throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). OTA represents an important step towards the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) by leveraging capabilities currently available in Air-Traffic Management (ATM) and aircraft automation systems. During the initial phases of this project, an operational evaluation of a simplified Tailored Arrival implementation involving trans-pacific arrivals to the west coast is being conducted. The field evaluation allows for measurement of the accuracy of 4D trajectory predictions that are needed for comparison with actual flight track data. The trajectory predictions for validation are independently produced by an adaptation of the En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) ground based decision support tool and the aircrafts’ Flight Management Systems (FMS). Later stages of the test will study the use of the ground-based decision support tool to adapt Tailored Arrival solutions to complex traffic conditions. Flexible “tailoring” of the upstream portions of the arrival trajectory will be accomplished through the use of NASA’s En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) prototype.  OTA project development to date has been successfully focused on preparation for the initial field evaluation activity. For continued development of the air traffic management systems needed to support  a mature NGATS solution, additional work, not included in the original contract, is now required.  As concepts to improve air traffic services and increase the operating capacity of the NAS are developed by the JPDO for possible implementation under NGATS, extensive assessment of feasibility and overall system impact of proposed changes is required. The requirement for evaluation and analysis of capacity enhancement initiatives has been defined by the JPDO Evaluation and Analysis Division Working Group (EAD). This work requires refinement of unique, specialized modeling techniques and analysis methodologies. These include the Boeing Company’s Airport Capacity Constraints model and the National Flow Model. This work requires collaboration with other JPDO working group members for input parameter selection and identification of analysis and reporting requirements.	  The prior effort for Oceanic Tailored Arrivals development and evaluation was first obtained when NASA issued a sole source acquisition and purchased the requirement from The Boeing Company under Boeing’s GSA Federal Supply Schedule for Professional Engineering Services. The original contract number is GS-23F0183K.  The Boeing Company is the only known source that possesses the existing tools, technical knowledge, and experience to continue development of the comprehensive air traffic management systems needed.  The government has invested a substantial amount of resources toward the development of this program and technical content research.	The Boeing Company’s personnel posses a steadfast understanding of technology needs, requirements, and expertise of this research field.	 This is a research and development acquisition and NASA intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract with The Boeing Company under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This request is considered to be sole source to The Boeing Company; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.	   Contract performance is anticipated to begin the early part of April 2006. This procurement is anticipated to be a two year contract.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 See Note “26”. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on March 29, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  Point of Contact Name: Nellie M.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI6035 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-08.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure, on a sole-source basis  using simplified acquisitions procedures clinical patient samples from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD., for use in intramural projects Z01-AI000358-23, Immunopathogenesis of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection and Z01-AI000361-23, International Studies of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)).  The purpose in collecting these samples is to diagnose the presence of sexually transmitted diseases, provide appropriate treatment, and to store these samples without patient identifiers for further anonymous testing in the pursuit of new knowledge by laboratory research.  This research includes the development of new assays as well as the study of the effectiveness of various assays in detecting the presence of organisms in samples that are co-infected with two or more pathogens.  The International STD Services Laboratories of the John Hopkins School of Medicine has had long-standing access to patients with sexually-transmitted diseases and has provided diagnostic testing services- using advanced molecular probes for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, Trichomonas, HIV and human papillomavirus- to the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID for many years.  For the good of the government, the vendor should not be changed now because many of the patients who have provided clinical specimens to this laboratory for past and current studies will be followed in the future as part of longitudinal analyses.  This includes the Rakai cohort in Uganda, one of the largest and best-organized cohorts in the world; and the large population available at the Baltimore City Health Department.  Changing patient populations would make such prospective follow-up impossible and seriously limit the number and kinds of scientific discoveries that can be derived from this data.  Contractor will meet objectives as indicated: 1. Contractor will identify, collect, and transport 10-cc clotted blood specimens on ice within three (if local shipment) to thirty-six hours (if international shipment) of collection from physician-referred patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics and student health clinics who have a history of infection for herpes simplex virus to the Project Officer. 2. Contractor will identify, collect, and transport approximately 100 ml. of heparinized blood samples on ice within three (if local shipment) to thirty-six hours (if international shipment) of blood collection from patients with active, recurrent herpes simplex virus infection and HSV seropositive sexual partners of these patients following an extensive history and physical examination for herpes simplex virus infection to the Project Officer; 3. Contractor will identify, collect, and transport 50 to 100 ml of heparinized blood samples on ice within three (if local shipment) to thirty-six hours (if international shipment) of collection from the patient with a primary genital herpes simplex virus infection to the Project Officer; 4. Contractor will repeat blood sample collection, and transport on ice within three hours (if local shipment) to thirty-six hours of patients monitored prospectively and re-cultured for herpes simplex virus at each recurrence during and after each recurrence for up to three recurrences and at six months after primary infection in those without a recurrence; 5. Contractor will complete and provide to the Project Officer, a clinical summary of each patient enrolled in the study including demographic information, history, clinical findings and results of laboratory tests.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $12.5 million dollars. This is a firm fixed-price contract, and the FOB terms are “Destination.” All items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Baltimore, MD. The anticipated period of performance will be 03/22/06-06/30/06.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items.

Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. (EST) Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, March 17, 2006.

STATEMENT OF WORK

FOR

HIGH DENSITY MOBILE SHELVING 

1.	Objective:  Air Mobility Command Communications Group (AMC CG) requires complete storage solution for a recently acquired warehouse.  This warehouse will store AMC CG and A6x new Information Technology (IT) hardware pending installation, bench stock hardware, test equipment, and technical refresh equipment as approved by the AMC CG Plans and Implementation Flight.

2.	Background:  AMC CG (Scott AFB) has recently been provided a warehouse for the consolidated storage of AMC CG Installation and Enterprise IT Equipment.

3.	Requirement:
3.1	IT Storage Solution:  This solution will include the maximization of space utilizing the vertical height of the facility.  The attached drawing reflects a suggested layout of the space based on the types of items that will be housed in the building.  At a minimum, the solution should include the ability to store palletized equipment, shelved items and bulk storage item.  Pallet storage should be capable of storing 18-20 standard size pallets with equipment stacked 4 ft high on each pallet.  Shelf storage solutions capable of maximizing the area should be used (i.e. space saver shelves).  These shelves must be capable of storing boxes as large as 45”W x 27 ¾”D x 59”H.  The overall solution must include a bulk storage area for items that are too large for shelf or rack storage.  Weight requirements for the shelves and pallet racks should be sufficient enough to store IT equipment such as servers, cable spools, computers, monitors and other like IT items.  The solution must follow the standards set for them in 48 UFC 3-600-01, dated 17 April 2003.
3.2	The exact warehouse configuration is at the discretion of the designer, but MUST maximize storage capability.
3.3	The warehouse is new construction and major modifications to the facility are not authorized.
3.4	A CAD drawing of the facility has been attached to assist with determining the best layout.
3.5	Proposals must include costs broken down by component and a comprehensive drawing of the solution in .JPG or hard copy format.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This enhancement will be developed by building upon th e infrastructure currently existing in the GVSL for conduct  of Warrior/Hardware-in-the-loop simulations.  The technology to be developed will advance the Armys ability to evaluate vehicle systems with regard to mobility, durability, and operations on the  move.  It must be able to execute in real-time and must be physics-based.  The successful contractor will be required to provide the GVSL with the expertise, software, support, and services to perform the above mission.

In the interest of maintaining the same level of quality, cost control and management of the Lock operation, as well as, to avoid disruption of the services and to ensure continuity of the entire Lock opera tion, it is in the best interest of the government to have OMNI Corporation, the incumbent contractor, to perform an extension of these services.   OMNI has the expertise and an experienced staff that is fully capable of operating and maintaining the lock without additional assistance from the Government.  OMNI has trained and experienced lock-operating personnel (the contract requires a minimum of 3 years lock operating experience per lock operator or the completion of 80 hours of approved training).  OMNI provides well-trained experienced personnel with the expertise to assume the immediate operation and maintenance of the Chicago Harbor Lock.  OMNI' s employees have a very intimate knowledge of the lock and its mechanical and electrical systems.  Most of their lock operators have 5 to 8 years of experience operating and maintaining the Chicago Lock Continuity of the services provided by OMNI is essent ial to the carrying out the Agencys navigation mission in meeting the needs of its customer, which is to aid the transport cargo in and out of the harbors in the Chicago land area.  If this agency were to contract these services from another source, the new source would have to expend numerous years and dollars learning, researching and reviewing data to acquaint itself with the Chicago Harbor Lock.  The Government would also have to expend numerous dollars, in addition to the funding provided for administering the contract, to teach and supervise a new contractor until they were fully capable of operating and maintaining the harbor lock effectively, with no assistance from the Governm ent.   The period of performance for these services will be approximately six (6) months. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed-price.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) intends to procure fabrication and installation services of a lighted aid to navigation/science platform.  The FKNMS is co-managed with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; together, they are charged with protecting the marine resources of the Florida Keys from Biscayne Bay through Dry Tortugas National Park.  Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary is one of the most well known and frequently visited reefs within FKNMS.  One of the most devastating causes of injury to the reefs in the Florida Keys are vessel groundings, many of which are the result of insufficient lighted aids to navigation in the area. Although Looe Key has numerous moorings and boundary buoys marking these zones, it is marked by only one true aid to navigation; a 10’ lighted marker (designated as Red “24”) on the southeast corner of the reef.   There are no other lighted aids within 4 nautical miles of Looe Key “24”.  The main goal of this project is to establish a lighted aid to navigation on the southwest corner of Looe Key to provide further protection from these vessel groundings.  Another important function of this platform will be to mount instruments for scientific research and public outreach programs known as the Telepresence Project.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, material handling for delivery to the offshore site, tools, testing devices, security, accountability, submittals, supervision, equipment, each and every item of expense necessary for supply, fabrication, erection, and installation of the lighted aid to navigation.  This generally includes, but is not limited to, the fabrication of the platform per the drawings and specifications provided by the Government, installation of the pile in the marine environment, and offshore fabrication to permanently affix the platform to the pile.  The contractor will be required to comply with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, the FKNMS regulations (15 CFR 922) and any permit conditions listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Private Aide To Navigation Permit, the Army Corps of Engineers Permit, and the FKNMS Manager’s permit.  NOAA will obtain the necessary Federal permits for this project.  The contractor shall be responsible for incorporating any permit requirements provided by the Government into the operations.

The Government intends to award a contract under FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR 15 (Contracting By Negotiation) following evaluation of the Technical Performance criteria and Price.  The following Technical Performance criteria (comprised of 4 components) will be used in evaluating the proposals:  (1) Experience with Similar Types of Construction, (2) Past Performance, (3) Project Team and Their Experience and (4) Overall Project Work Plan.  The Technical Performance, when combined, will be considered equal in value to Price during the evaluation process. This is a 100% HubZone set aside. The NAICS code is 332999 and the small business size standard is a maximum of 500 employees. The size of this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. The completion time for this project is sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. The Request For Proposal is currently available by accessing the following web address: https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.vendorlogin?openform&SolicitationNumber=WC133F05RP1146JAA.

<DESC>Modification: The pre-proposal conference will be held Thursday March 16, 2006 at 10:00am at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building located at 230 N. First Avenue, Phoenix, AZ in the Joint Use Conference Room, Suite 205.

The General Services Administration will be issuing a RFP solicitation for Design-Build Services for a project at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building located at 230 N. First Avenue, Phoenix, AZ.  A Design-Build program document will be used to solicit bids from qualified Design-Build contractors. The document will serve as the basis for the design build contractors to provide a technical package and price proposal package to complete the project.  Once awarded, the design build contractor will provide complete construction drawings and then proceed to complete construction.
 
This project will involve the North and South elevations of the building, where the current fresh air intakes are located. The mechanical rooms, located at the North and South elevations, currently use fresh air intake fed through on-grade and above-grade openings from the basement to the 8th floor.  The objective of the project is to seal off the current air intakes from the street level up forty feet to limit fresh air intake to the area at forty feet and above.

All work will need to be closely coordinated with GSA to ensure undisturbed and normal operations of the building and its tenants during the construction period.  Any disruptive work may have to be scheduled for after hours.  The total estimated budget on this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  All employees working on this project will need to pass a full background check through the Department of Homeland Security.

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.
Per AAFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential small business capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to provide a quality assurance program to evaluate and document the performance of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).  Primary support of this contract shall be to provide in-field systems and performance survey services (herein after referred to as surveys) to assess and aid the performance and maintenance of the nationwide, long-term wet deposition monitoring networks of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).  NADP collection stations are currently comprised in three sub-networks which include: precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the National Trends Network (NTN); precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN); and measurements of mercury concentrations in precipitation at wet deposition sites in the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN).  There are currently over 250 wet deposition sites in the NADP/NTN, over 90 sites in the NADP/MDN, including over 40 that are collocated at NTN sites, and 8 sites in NADP/AIRMoN, including three that are collocated at NTN sites. NADP operates sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.  EPA provides support to the National Acid Deposition Program (NADP), a cooperative, multi-agency network, which measures precipitation chemistry and estimates atmospheric deposition for various pollutant ions and mercury. The surveys are undertaken to provide quality assurance pertaining to siting, sample collection and handling, equipment operation and maintenance, record keeping, reports and field laboratory procedures.  Site performance survey reports for the networks must be compatible with, and capable of, being electronically transferred to the data base maintained by NADP.   The surveys are essential to providing the quality assurance for NADP?s data analysis and require a high level of skill in audits of air quality monitoring systems and quality assurance, quality control, and data management.  The contractor will be responsible for selecting sites for survey and initial communications, making pre-trip travel and other preparations, conducting site surveys, providing technical assistance to site operators, and conducting maintenance. The purpose of this announcement is to determine the availability and capability of small business firms to perform the above-described activities.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541620.  Interested small businesses must demonstrate in their qualification statements that they are qualified to perform work under this NAICS code.  The contract type will be firm fixed price with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  This is a request for interested small business firms to submit a qualification statement of no longer than 10 pages to determine whether or not this procurement will be set aside for small businesses.  This is not a request for a technical or cost proposal. This request is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small businesses.  Interested businesses must demonstrate and will be evaluated on specific prior project experience and skill in the following areas:  field audits of air quality monitoring and quality assurance, field instrumentation, and data collection and laboratory procedure capabilities.  The qualification statement should include:  specific prior experience in these areas and should include:  specific prior experience in these areas and personnel skills to meet this experience. General information on firm size (employees/revenue), location, financial revenues, other contracts for related work, both federal and commercial should be provided.  Small businesses shall submit two (2) copies of the requested information in writing to U.S. EPA, Attn:  Denise Roberson (3803R), mailing address, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460 or HAND CARRY/COURIER/OVERNIGHT CARRIER ADDRESS: Environmental Protection Agency Bid and Proposal Room, Ronald Reagan Building, 6th Floor ATTN: Denise Roberson (Mail Code 3803R) 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

The Laboratory Operations Division (LOD) is currently implementing a quality management system (QMS) based on the principles and requirements contained in ISO 17025.  ISO 17025 is a quality management standard equivalent to ISO 9000:2000, but with specific laboratory focus. Because a QMS shoud be an  integral part of the daily business processes, NVFEL is seeking a software tool that shall allow for increased efficiency and improved communication channels.  The software tool shall contain modules (or databases) based on an ISO quality system, have email capability, and be utilized to assist  workflow and follow-up.  Workflow is defined both within and between modules.  The software package shall contain (at a minimum) the following key modules: document control, change control/notification, training, and corrective/preventive action. Software packages shall be commerical off-the-shelf  (COTS) with the ability to modify the software with the addition/deletion of modules.  Software packages which also contain modules that allows for audits, planning, risk assessment, deviations/non-conformances, customer concerns(complaints) and calibration tracking will receive preference by the  EPA.  The option to incorporate modules based on ISO 14000 Environmental System requirements and or OHSAS-1800 Safety and Health Management requirements is desirable.   The modules contained within the package shall be easily configurable by non-Information Technology personnel and should be  supplied with existing industry (or ISO accepted) forms and templates.  Delivery of this software package and selected option to NVFEL is expected within approximately 6 months or less.  Contractor may be requested to demostrate the functionality of software package.  Contractor must have all  approved licenses and agreements to modify the software if not owned by contractor.  Government will expected "unrestricted data rights " to the software purchased.

The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC) has a requirement for the renewal of the EarthWhere Spatial Data Provisioning Services. This consists of a base period of six-months, 4/1/2006 through 9/30/2006, and one (1) six-month option period, 10/1/2006 through 3/31/2007. The EarthWhere Spatial Data Provisioning System is composed of multiple integrated hardware and software components that together meet the need for storing, managing, viewing, processing and delivering large spatial data sets. The system must include a data storage capacity of approximately 35TB for USGS and commercial data and imagery. It is required that the storage have a data management front end, web interface, API to existing applications, and a data processing and delivery mechanism and EarthWhere software that provides the functionality required to manage, process, and deliver the spatial data used by the USGS NGTOC. In accordance with 36CFR Part 1194, the resources acquired must be compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from SANZ, Inc., Englewood, Colorado and proposes to negotiate a contract with this company on that basis.

Firms who feel they can furnish the required multiple integrated hardware and software components or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement within thirty days after the date of publication of this synopsis. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. No solicitation document exists, therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the government's only official notice of this procurement.

<RESPDATE>040706
<CONTACT>Joy Dickson, 405-954-1015
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering the replacement of a lift used as part of its Antenna Range Tower located in Oklahoma City, OK.  Accordingly, the FAA is requesting information as to the availability of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) lift that could be used to replace the existing lift currently in use.  Reference the  "Antenna Range Tower Antenna Lift" attachment that provides information on the background of the issues surrounding the lift, its use, component identification, and functions. There have been several changes in technologies and safety requirements since the original installation of the antenna range lift fixture 20 years ago.  Due to a number of issues that have since been identified (see attachment), the FAA is contemplating replacement of the lift with a new one that employs later technology while addressing all of the current safety concerns. Interested vendors that possess a lift representing either a COTS item or a modified-COTS item they believe can fulfill the FAA's needs may want to make a site visit to review the existing Antenna Range Tower Antenna Lift located at 8201 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK  73169.  A day to view the lift and its components will be made available to vendors contemplating offering a replacement solution.  Access to the tower and lift for the replacement of the lift is to be limited to M-F 8am - 6pm.  At any time during those hours, it may be necessary to request the vendor to withdraw from the immediate area, so that other work may be accomplished on the range.  Arrangements for a site visit may be made by contacting Mr. Robert Jasper at (405) 954-1266 or by e-mail at Robert.Jasper@faa.gov.    Interested vendors that choose to propose a replacement solution must provide/address the following with their response to this RFI: 1)  The option of utilizing any of the existing components (except for the winch) as part of the proposed replacement solution;   	2)  Actual replacement of the lift must be susceptible to being accomplished within 45 calendar days; 3)  Availability of certification of the lift by an appropriate authority (as deemed by existing safety regulations); 4)  Nature and extent of any warranty; 5)  All electrical or mechanical components utilized must be weatherproof as appropriate for the conditions at the antenna range site; 6)  All equipment utilized or installed in the replacement of the lift must be listed and associated specifications provided;   7)  A description of the availability of supportability of each component; 8)  A maintenance schedule with specific how-to instructions and frequency requirements for each maintenance task; 9)  "Train-the-Trainer" training applicable to any safety certifications, lift operation, and lift maintenance procedures; 10) A product manual and user's manual for the lift; 11) Safety issues/concerns addressed in the Wynne Engineering reports;  12) The method for lifting the beacon antennas into place and mounting them to the positioner without the use of an external crane; and, 13) A rough order of magnitude of price for the proposed lift as well as installation to include a copy of any established catalog price list pertaining to the lift. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this RFI.  Any information received as a result of this RFI will not be for use outside the Government. Information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether replacement options are available as well as affordable.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This RFI shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire the lift.  Based on the nature and extent of responses received to this RFI, additional information/details may be requested to that already provided with the vendor's initial submittal.   Responses to this RFI are due by COB, Tuesday, April 11, 2006.  Responses are to be submitted to Federal Aviation Administration, Attn:  Joy Dickson (AMQ-210), 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125.  Responses sent by overnight means should be sent to Federal Aviation Administration, Attn:  Joy Dickson (AMQ-210)/Room 312, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK  73169.  Electronic submissions are permissible and should be sent to Joy.Dickson@faa.gov.  Direct all questions or requests for clarification regarding this RFI to Joy Dickson, Contracting Officer, at (405) 954-1015 or by e-mail at Joy.Dickson@faa.gov.

ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION
The competition for the management and operation of NCAR will be open to universities or consortia of universities, other not-for-profit or nonprofit organizations, and any industrial firm operating as an autonomous organization or as an identifiable separate operating unit of a parent organization.
NCAR operations must be conducted in the public interest with objectivity and independence, free from organizational conflicts of interest, and with full disclosure of its affairs to NSF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
NCAR was established in 1960 in Boulder, Colorado as a center of excellence for research and education in atmospheric science, providing research, facilities and services for the atmospheric and wider geosciences community. NCAR was designated as an NSF FFRDC in the early 1970s. The current cooperative agreement, for a total amount not exceeding $548M, began October 1, 2003 and will expire on September 30, 2008. The 2005 base budget for the operation of NCAR was approximately $80M, with additional support from other agencies of approximately $14M.
The NCAR mission is to support, enhance and extend the capabilities of the atmospheric and broader science community by planning, organizing and conducting atmospheric and related research programs in collaboration with universities and other institutions, providing state-of-the-art research tools and facilities to the atmospheric sciences community, supporting and enhancing university atmospheric science education, and facilitating the transfer of technology to both the public and private sectors. 
NCAR facilities and computing infrastructure currently available for use by the scientific community include two NSF-owned research aircraft, ground-based and airborne radar, lidar and radiometer systems, surface sounders and sondes. NCAR also develops and maintains sophisticated climate and meteorological models, and provides high-end supercomputing, network and data services for the atmospheric and broader geosciences community. 
SPONSOR’S CONCEPT OF NCAR OPERATIONS 
The recipient of the award (hereinafter referred to as the “Awardee”) shall manage space and equipment provided by NSF, will provide additional space and equipment as necessary, and will provide support and technical personnel to manage NCAR as an FFRDC. NCAR will act as a strategic partner of NSF, and will plan and execute a broad research program consistent with the objectives and priorities of NSF and the scientific community. Although NSF is the sponsoring agency, the scientific community is NCAR’s primary customer; therefore, a significant portion of the research program will be carried out in collaboration with the community. NCAR will enhance the ability of the community to collectively explore, develop and extend its ideas by providing access to shared observational facilities, computational infrastructure and databases, and an integrated support network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization.
TASKS PERFORMED FOR OTHER THAN THE SPONSOR 
As an FFRDC, NCAR may not use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector; however, NCAR may perform work for other agencies under the Economy Act or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and is consistent with NCAR’s mission as defined by NSF. Such work may be either accepted by NSF or authorized via amendment to the cooperative agreement, or in some cases provided by the other agency directly to NCAR. 
CAPABILITY STATEMENT CONTENT
Interested organizations may submit a statement of their capabilities to perform the sponsor’s concept of NCAR operations. 
Organizations submitting capability statements will be assessed on the following:
1)	Broad knowledge of, and connection to, the atmospheric and wider geosciences community.
2)	An ability to attract, develop and retain experienced and highly qualified personnel for the facilities and research environments that NCAR is expected to operate.
3)	Experience in the successful management and operation of complex facilities, virtual or physical, including responsibility for providing critical logistics support for short and long-term scientific initiatives.
4)	The necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls (including such elements as property control and procurement systems), and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them along with adequate financial resources. 
The Capability Statement shall not exceed 10 pages, and shall provide only substantive information essential for proper review. Attachments are not authorized and will not be considered. The Government will not pay for the cost of preparing and submitting the Capability Statement. The submission must be received at NSF no later than May 1, 2006 at 4PM EST. Amendments to responses after the close of this notice are not authorized and will not be considered. 
Written Capability Statements may be submitted by mail to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Kristin Spencer, Grant & Agreement Specialist, Division of Contracts and Complex Agreements, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Room 475, Arlington, VA  22230 or electronically to kspencer@nsf.gov . Facsimile responses are not authorized.
EVALUATION OF RESPONSES
Responses to this notice will be evaluated on the basis of the aforementioned capabilities. Only information submitted in response to this notice will be considered. Additional information and/or amendments to responses after the close of this notice are not authorized and will not be considered. 
Based on the Government’s assessment of the information provided, NSF will send a written notice advising respondents of their potential to be viable competitors. Organizations providing capability statements in response to this announcement will not be rank ordered, weighted or scored. NSF’s response will be advisement only, not a final determination. The advisement does not preclude any respondent from submitting a proposal in the future competition, nor will it guarantee award. 
NSF will respond to written questions regarding the assessment. The NSF response may be in writing or in a meeting at NSF, at NSF’s discretion.
ANTICIPATED COMPETITION SCHEDULE
This notice does not constitute a solicitation; therefore, no award of any kind will result from this notice. Although the competition is still in planning stage, NSF anticipates that a program solicitation will be issued on or about October 31, 2006. 
It is expected that the solicitation will define the competition as a two-stage process. Preliminary proposals outlining the organization’s vision and/or concept of design for the future of NCAR would be due on or about January 31, 2007. The preliminary proposal would be intended to provide an overview of the applicant’s approach, and as such would be limited in length. Applicants would be notified of the outcome of evaluation of preliminary proposals by mid May 2007. Only those organizations successful in this stage would then be invited to submit full proposals, with an expected due date of August 1, 2007.

<DESC>The construction required consists of driving approximately 1,600 feet of sheetpile wall in Jefferson Parish, LA adjacent to the point where Vintage Blvd. intersects the floodwall at the western boundry of Jefferson Parish, some 0.9 miles south of La ke Pontchartrain.  The sheet pile is to be installed along an alignment parallel to an existing concrete capped sheetpile wall extending roughly 9 feet above the ground surface, but offset approximately 3 feet to the protected side from this existing wall.   The sheets to be driven are PZ-35 sheets 60 feet long that will be delivered to the worksite in pairs by truck.  They are to be driven approximately 54 feet into the gound, leaving 6 feet of sheet pile above ground.  The steel sheets have been pre-purcha sed FOB jobsite, and it will be the contractors responsibility to coordinate delivery to the site, and to unload the sheets.  The worksite is open, without overhead obstruction, and there are no known subsurface obstacles.  It is anticipated that a contrac t would be awarded for this work on May 1, 2006.  It is required that the driving of the sheetpile be completed by June 1, 2005.  Allow one week for delivery of sheetpile, once the supplier is requested to ship.  We will accept multiple pile-driving operat ion and working 24 hours per day.  Need a response via e-mail no later than 03/11/06.

...............Statement of Work:...............
Evaluation of Climate Forecast Applications Research in Africa.....

Background: 

From the mid 90’s to date, NOAA and a range of partners, such as USAID-OFDA, and, in collaboration with the International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate Prediction, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the National Center for Environmental Prediction, Climate Prediction Centre (NCEP/CPC), have supported climate forecast applications research in developing regions, such as those mentioned earlier.  The purpose of the research was two fold:  1) to build the capacity of developing regions’ forecasters to produce better skilled forecasts, and 2) to build the capacity of users and intermediaries of seasonal forecast information to effectively apply seasonal forecast information. 

Many of the findings of the research are available but in many different reports and formats.  While most of the research has been conducted in Africa, NOAA requires the expertise needed to gather together and report on, the opportunities and limitations of climate forecast use in these developing regions.....

Tasks: 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires assistance in learning from findings of a decade long climate applications research study in developing regions of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the South east Asia and the South Pacific. The contractor will, therefore, use the African Region as a test-bed to evaluate NOAA’s supported climate forecast applications research in the developing regions.....

The evaluation will address the following issues/questions:  

1) What have been the uses of climate forecast information in specific sectors such as agriculture, water, human health coastal and disaster management?....

2) What are the current capacities of the information producers, intermediaries and users in the Africa?.... 

3) What systems of forecast communications do exist in the region?....  

4) Which of the systems have worked?....

The evaluation will also carry out an analysis of the RANET (Radio and Internet for Communication of Hydro-meteorological and Climate Related Information).....

The RANET evaluation will focus on the following questions: 

1) Is the technology appropriate?  

2) Is RANET delivering the right type of information?  

3) Is the RANET a sustainable intervention for communicating climate information
in Africa?  

4) Are decision makers using the RANET information to change decisions?....

Deliverable:

The Contractor will provide NOAA a report that will be highly accessible to NOAA policy makers that will contain recommendations for improving NOAA and partners’ climate service program performance in Africa.  An important element of the report will be costs and benefits analysis of climate forecast development and communication.....

Period of Performance:  The study would take place over 12 month period.

Contractor shall provide all travel, labor, materials and equipment to accomplish pest control service according to the below statement of work for the U. S. Border Patrol for the locations listed.

1.	EXTERIOR TREATMENTS:  

The exterior treatment will consist of inspecting all building exteriors and areas adjacent to the structures.  During this inspection, insect resource and reservoir sites will be identified and serviced in an appropriate manner.  Servicing may include residual spot treatment, baiting, or granulation, or other applications as required.  Additionally, conditions conducive to insect/rodent habitation will be identified and reported to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR).

2.	INTERIOR TREATMENTS:  

Interior treatment will involve a visual inspection of all buildings within the complex.  Monitors will be placed in discreet areas where infestations are most likely to occur.  When activity is observed, treatment will be rendered using non-chemical methods when possible and chemical methods when required.  Additionally, conditions conducive to insect/rodent habitation will be documented and reported to the COTR.

These methods are to ensure that chemicals (if needed) are applied to the areas where insects breed/harbor and virtually eliminate odors and chemical exposures normally associated with pesticide applications.

3.	SERVICE SCHEDULE:  

Service will be performed monthly on a regular scheduled basis, the same day each month (i.e. first Monday, second Wednesday, etc.)  If the regular scheduled day falls on a holiday, prior arrangements for rescheduling service will be made.

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT SIGNED SERVICE TICKETS BE FORWARDED TO TUCSON SECTOR BILLING TO ENSURE PAYMENTS ARE PROCESSED.  Invoice(s) cannot be processed without the certified signatures.  A list of appointed COTR's will be provided for each location at the time of award.

         b.  A verbal and written report of findings and service will be provided at the end of each service to the COTR for each office or building.  

         c.  If sanitation or other in-house factors become a problem to the extent that the pest control contractor cannot maintain an effective pest control program, the contractor must notify the COTR so that the Border Patrol can ensure that these factors are corrected.

             (3)  Monitoring:  Sticky traps shall be used to guide and evaluate indoor insect control efforts whenever necessary.

             (4)  Application of Insecticides to Exposed Surfaces or as Space Sprays:  Application of insecticides to exposed surfaces or as space sprays (including fogs, mists and ultra-low volume applications) shall be restricted to unique situations where no alternative measures are practical.  The contractor shall obtain approval from the COTR prior to any application of insecticide to any exposed surface or any space spray treatment.  No surface application or space spray shall be made while tenant personnel are present.  The contractor shall take all necessary precautions to ensure tenant and employee safety, and all necessary steps to ensure the containment of the pesticide to the site of application.

12.	RODENT CONTROL:

        a.  All bait boxes will be placed out of the general view, in locations where they will not be disturbed by routine operations.

        b.  The lids of all bait boxes shall be securely locked or fastened shut.

        c.  All bait boxes shall be securely attached or anchored to the floor, ground, wall, or other immovable surface, so the box cannot be picked up or moved.

        d.  Bait shall be secured (with wire or other appropriate means) within the bait box within the baffle protected feeding chamber of the box and never in the runway of the box.

        e.  All bait boxes will be labeled on the inside with the contractor's business name and address and dated by the contractor's technician at the time of installation and servicing.

        f.  In order to measure effectiveness of rodenticide baiting program, on each service visit contractor will record bait consumption for each bait station serviced.  Bait consumption reports will be forwarded to the COTR.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  “Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described below.  Delivery & Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made other than the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  Price proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described in Section B.


Vendors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this proposal is based.  All assumptions (both technical and price) shall be included in the proposal.

A.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors.

 	Past Performance
  	Delivery    				

Assumptions, Conditions, and Exceptions will be reviewed for acceptability and potential impact on information provided in the task order proposal.

	1.  Delivery

	The Government is seeking to determine the speed of delivery.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of the delivery proposal from the vendor.

	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE

	If the vendor has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the sub-factors below, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this SOW.  The past performance information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.

	Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.
	Past performance will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the SOW.
	Each proposal is required to describe a minimum of two but not more than five prior relevant projects that have been completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this SOW.   Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
	Past performance must be relevant to the support required for the delivery order.  Deliverables must meet contract requirements technical excellence, timing, budgeting and report accuracy.  Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.

	
B.  PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION.  Vendors’ price proposal will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness.  Vendors’ technical and price proposals will be evaluated in determining best value to the Government.  Price will be evaluated, but not rated.

<DESC>Scope of work
Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Connectivity Initiative is to enhance assessment of the implications of emerging unpredictable disasters and to effectively respond to them. This initiative will lead to better coordination of disaster responses among various government and international agencies and will also allow for various stakeholders to interact. 

The impact this will achieve is that lives and livelihoods will be more secure in woredas (districts) highly vulnerable to unpredictable shocks because responses to future threats will be made in a timelier manner in a fashion better adapted to local needs.

Objectives
1)	To interconnect the federal DPPA with its regional DPPA counterparts to allow for the sharing and integration of data collected at the local level.
2)	To enhance communication between the regional administration and woredas (districts).
3)	To enable DPPA and its partners (at district, zonal, regional and federal levels) to have the capacity and capability to respond in a timely and effective manner to unpredictable shocks based on adequate and timely early warning information
Performance Phasing

This will be a maximum two-year contract that will be incrementally funded. The successful completion of each part is required before subsequent financial commitments will be made. Phase 1 and Phase 2 (see below) will form the initial commitment.

NOTICE: Please contact the CO for the full solicitation.

The Government anticipates making an award to a minimum of four (4) up to a maximum of seven (7) [ of which at least one will be a SDVOSB (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business)].  It is the Government's intent to establish terms and conditions to effect repairs and alterations to provide prompt services on an as needed basis at minimum administrative costs and that the work will be performed in an expeditious and efficient manner within the budgetary limitations and performance time established for each delivery order.  This project includes but is not limited to the following work:  Demolition; Furnish and Install (Ceilings, Windows, Doors, Hardware, and partitions, Carpeting, Floor Tile and Insulation), Specialties (Fire Protection System); Mechanical; and Electrical. The work may include any of the items listed in the "Unit Price Schedule" and/or "Specifications" and may be performed at various owned and leased facilities within the areas mentioned above. The term of the contracts will be for one year (base) with four one-year options, for a total of five (5) years. Estimated Cost for the combined five years is $1,000,000 or $200,000 per year. Orders placed against this contract will be between the minimum of $100.00 and maximum $25,000.00. The solicitation will be issued on or about 2/10/2006.  The NAICS Code is 236220.  Interested parties should fax a request to GSA at 215-209-0629.

Point of Contact: Michelle T. Holland, Contract Specialist at 215-446-4686. The Contracting Officer for this project is Bob Waring. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED!! 

This solicitation will be issued as full and open negotiated procurement with Source Selection procedures.  The selection of contractors will be pursuant to the best value concept.  All proposals received under this Request for Proposals will individually be ranked based on technical and price proposals submitted in comparison to the evaluation criteria listed below.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of technical capability and price.  (For this procurement, demonstrated technical capability is more important than price).  AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.

The evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.  FAILURE TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED EVIDENCE AND / OR RELATED INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY GSA WILL RESULT IN A FINDING OF NON-RESPONSIBILITY AS DEFINED BY FAR PART 9.    

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

Factor A: Experience and Qualifications - Past performance and experience on similar projects:  

Offerors are requested to demonstrate their construction experience in fully occupied office facilities by providing a list of five successful projects completed within the past five years, similar in dollar value, similar in nature, and similar working conditions as those anticipated in this contract. (The range of construction costs of the five projects should be between $2,000 and $25,000).  The list shall not exceed five pages.  

At least three of the five projects must be between $10,000 and $15,000, and one of the projects must be over $20,000.  Discuss the firm’s experience in handling such projects simultaneously.  Experience with managing multiple, simultaneous projects is considered an asset.  Offerors are required to provide the following information for each project submitted  (limit each project to one page).  

For the evaluation of this criterion, the firm is required to provide the following (limited to a maximum of five pages):
 
~  Name and location of the project
~  A description of the project 
~  Award amount and the final cost at construction completion 
~  Actual work the firm performed 
~  Owner’s name, telephone number, address, and person to contact
~  For each project listed, provide the number of other projects, dollar values, and a brief description of the projects which were performed concurrently with that project 

Board members will evaluate past performance by contacting references provided and discussing the offerors performance on the listed projects, addressing workmanship, timeliness, cost control, and technical success of the project.  The Board may also choose additional methods to evaluate past performance, such as visiting the site of the completed projects, Contractor Performance System (CPS), etc.  

Factor B:  Key Personnel Qualifications:  

Identify key personnel for the project team for orders to be placed under this contract and list their responsibilities, qualifications, and positions for the proposed projects.  Complete resumes for key personnel shall be provided for each member proposed to work on this contract and should list their education, training, qualifications, and experience relative to the tasks they will be performing (limited to four pages).  Include professional qualifications, specialized experience in this type of work and the technical competence of the staff on similar projects.  The government desires that key personnel have five or more years of construction renovation experience in occupied facilities.  Demonstrate that the project team has the ability to provide mechanical, architectural, electrical, and plumbing renovations in occupied buildings.  Offerors are required to discuss previous experience that the proposed key personnel may have in working together on past projects.  

Factor C:  Technical and Organizational Approach: 

1.  Offerors are required to present the resource allocation for handling construction orders simultaneously.  Discuss the firm’s technical and organizational abilities for performing projects in fully occupied facilities for projects costing between $2,000 and $25,000.  The discussions should include the team’s proposed organizational approach in addressing the management of construction projects simultaneously.  Describe how project phasing is managed.  In addition, describe how the construction performed under this will be managed and what methods will be employed to ensure timely and satisfactory completion of projects.  Use examples where appropriate.  Include a discussion of how the work will be accomplished regarding subcontractors and in-house staff.  Contractor’s employing an in-house staff is considered an asset.  

2.  If subcontracting is anticipated, include a list of proposed subcontractors and discuss their construction project experience.  Established, ongoing subcontractor relationship is considered to be an asset.  

PRICE PROPOSALS:

Past performance, personnel qualifications and technical qualifications are deemed to be the most important elements since GSA is seeking firms who will complete projects successfully and with the best workmanship.  The price is considered to be of importance, but not as important as the other three factors, since the overall goal is to acquire firms possessing technical expertise with sound professional backgrounds.  Source Selection Procedures require price to be a related factor, and award will be based on a combination of all four factors (Price becomes more important when the difference in technical scores is insignificant.)

Each offeror must submit unit prices for all items listed on Attachment A to the Standard Form 1442 for work to be performed during normal working hours for the base year of the contract.  The contractor shall also propose a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour Work for the Base Year; multiplier percentage factor for each of the four Option Years; a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour work for each of the four Option Years; and a multiplier percentage factor for travel.  

A multiplier percentage factor may be reflected as a plus, a minus, or "net".  For example, a percentage factor of plus 10 percent should be reflected as (+10%); a percentage factor of minus 10 percent should be reflected as (-10%).  Submitting the word "net" means the proposer will accept all line item prices as they are stated without any percent change.

NOTE: This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. The Bidder / Offeror must submit the attached DOCUMENT SECURITY FORM signed by the bidder / offeror. The document requires a copy of the business license, a DUNS Number and a IRS TAX ID Number. Request for Construction Documents Exhibit _______________ Attachment _______________ Solicitation _______________ DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. REASONABLE CARE: 1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below: Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: (a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and (b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

EVALUATION EVALUATION FOR AWARD:  To receive consideration for award, the proposal must adequately meet the requirements in this solicitation and be presented with adequate detail to assure the evaluator of an understanding of the requirements in the Performance Work  Statement.  All prices will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements.  All proposals will be rated by their content and will not assume that performance will include areas not address ed. Technical and past performance, when combine, are significantly more important than price in determining Best Value.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  Price, however, will be  given greater importance when Technical and Past Performance proposals approach equality  EVALUATION CRITERIA The following Technical Evaluation Factors will be used to evaluate the contractor proposals for ONETESS ADJECTIVAL	DEFINITION Excellent	Excellent understanding of requirements and proposes an approach that significantly exceeds minimum PWS requirements in a way very beneficial to the Army.  Very good probability of success with low degree of risk. Good	High quality in most respects and meets or exceeds minimum PWS requirements in a way beneficial to the Army.  Good probability of success with low to moderate degree of risk. Satisfactory	Adequate quality and meets minimum PWS requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.   Fair probability of success with low to moderate degree of risk. Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and proposes an approach that marginally meets or in some instances falls below minimum PWS requirements.  Moderate to high degree of risk.   Unsatisfactory	Fails to meet minimum PWS requirements necessary for acceptable performance.  Requirements can only be met with major changes to the proposal.  High degree of risk. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror      whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be  used to evaluate offers. The major areas of proposal evaluation are (a Technical (b) Past Performance and (c) Price.  The factors will be evaluated in compliance with the following: FACTOR 1: Technical/Management:  (Greatest Importance) ·	Demonstrate adequacy and relevance of expertise, experience and other technical personnel for performing all the requirements of the work statement   ·	Demonstrate experience of contractor and technical staff for planning, managing, and directing the requirement work statement. ·	Experience of proposed contractor to conduct a project of comparable size and complexity ·	Management ability to provide technical assistance and oversight ·	Demonstrate adequacy, relevance, and appropriateness of the offerors experience in managing consultants, collaborators, and subcontractors. FACTOR 2: Past Performance Factor: (Slightly Less Important Than Technical/Management) Present and Past Performance shall be evaluated as a measure of the         Governments confidence in the offerors ability to successfully perform based on previous and current contract efforts.   FACTOR 3:  Price (Least Important) ·	Price proposals will be analyzed for errors, mistakes, and omissions ·	Price proposal will be analyzed and evaluated for unbalanced offers ·	Price proposal will be analyzed to ensure burdened prices are included (Schedule) ·	The price proposal will be evaluated to determine realistic cost to the Government, such as comparing base period pricing will option years(s) pricing ·	A price analysis will be performed on all proposals by comparing competing offers prices to ensure th e price is fair and reasonable.  For the purposes of evaluating competing proposals, it may become necessary to perform a price-technical tradeoff and for comparison purposes only, the totals in each Amount column for each CLIN for the base and all optio n years will be added to reach a total evaluated price for each offer.  This sum will be used in the evaluation process only for the purpose of comparing price proposals and does not commit the Government to order any set amounts or to exercise any option( s).         52.212-5     CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2006)  (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553).
