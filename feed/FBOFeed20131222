<CONTACT>William Sedlak, Email wsedlak@usaid.gov
<DESC>USAID/Iraq is considering a modification to extend the period of performance and add additional funding to return prior approved activities to the SOW. The modification being considered for FDP would extend the period of performance up to 5 months, and increase the TEC between $2M to $4M. <br /><br />This award was modified (Modification 5) as part of USAID/Iraq's recent drawdown process and reduced the TEC to $43,322,834 ($10M reduction from original TEC), and reduced the period of performance by approximately 19 months. The SOW was also revised to remove certain activities that would no longer be achievable within the reduced period of performance.<br /> <br />The modification would re-insert key Retail Payment System Infrastructure and Credit Information Bureau activities which were included in the original award.  These activities were already part of the original full and open competition to implement the work (RFP-267-10-002). This modification will reinstate some activities cut when the mission did not envision that additional funding would be available. &nbsp;<br /><br />This action will give the current contractor sufficient resources to fully perform the relevant work without delaying the program. An award to another resource would jeopardize the momentum of the project by delaying these key financial programs.<br /><br />Based on the foregoing, competition for this modification is not a reasonable option. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely fo rthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the government not to re-compete these activities is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;
