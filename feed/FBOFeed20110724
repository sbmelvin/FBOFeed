<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to execute a contract modification to contract 200-2011-F-37823, Gulf States Population Survey (GSPS) with ICF Macro International, to refine the collection of Gulf States Population data that was specified in the original contract.
<p>Background and Need:</p>
<p>Since the initial fielding of the GSPS questionnaire in mid December, 2010, it has been determined that adjustments are required to the performance-based performance work statement to conduct a survey of the highest reliability and validity. It has been determined that in the population currently being sampled there is a high proportion of cell-phone only households that are being missed due to the original protocol of the survey being a landline only survey. In the affected counties it has been determined that there is a necessity to sub-sample approximately 20% of the population using a cell-phone version of the survey in order to capture this segment of the population and achieve accurate population coverage.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective.</p>
<p>This modification shall provide additional funding to implement the following redistribution of landline telephone respondents and cell phone respondents:</p>
<p>- 34,500 surveys with landline telephone respondents<br />- 5,500 surveys with cell phone respondents</p>
