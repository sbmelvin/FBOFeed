This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>NAMRU-6 Virology and Emerging Infections Department (VEID) is seeking to purchase laboratory reagents to be used for molecular diagnosis of viruses associated with ongoing protocols studying respiratory, gastrointestinal and arboviral diseases across multiple study sites and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platforms. Specifically, the requirement involves PCR enzymes for reverse transcription, real-time platforms, and sanger sequencing. Standard operating procedures for use of these reagents have been developed for each pathogen and validated to ensure requirements for scientific rigor are met in regard to precision and accuracy. Standardization and validation of experiments has been performed using reagents such as QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, RNeasy Mini Kit, and others.<br />The use of the above reagents has proven compatible with NAMRU-6 diagnostic equipment and procedures and altering brand or vendor represents a loss in result comparability, supervisor and technician time to develop and validate new procedures and results, and potential logistics barriers given our overseas location and supply support system. The PCR assays have been developed independently for each SOP and involve much time and effort by laboratory technicians, and supervisors for final approval. Reagents used must remain the same as the ones indicated in the SOPs, otherwise the design and validation of these processes would have to be re-initiated, which would delay all processing and the timely diagnosis of public health relevant pathogens.<br />This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.<br />Capability statements are due by 12:00 PM Local Time, 16&nbsp;April 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail only as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: genaro.m.vasquez.fn@mail.mil. Please use subject line "N44852VEID180342"

<CONTACT>Scott A. Szczesniak, Phone 8042795950, Email scott.szczesniak@dla.mil
<DESC>DLA Aviation intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to General Electric Company, CAGE 07482, via a letter Request for Proposal (RFP). A copy of the solicitation will not be available via the DLA-BSM Internet Bid Board Systems (DIBBS) nor the Government-Wide Point of Entry (GPE) FedBizOpps. A copy of this solicitation may only be available to requesters by contacting the Point of Contract (POC) for this notice directly. The agency intends to award a subsumable contract in accordance with the general terms and conditions for the General Electric (GE) Captains of Industry (COI) Supplier Capability Contract (SCC) SPE4AX-18-D-9418. DLA has determined that real-time access to the engineering expertise, technical data and understanding of the manufacturing processes offered by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is essential to successfully provide support for TF34 Engines' maintenance and improved availability. As such, the acquisition has been approved for Other than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1. The only approved source for this requirement is the General Electric Company, CAGE 07482. Any responsible source, other than the approved source, who would like to submit a proposal for this requirement, must submit a complete Source Approval Request (SAR) package.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This requirement for TF34 Engine Performance Based Supply Chain Management Support will include approximately 2,033 NSNs and will include metrics with incentives/disincentives tied to achieving improved customer outcomes. This population of items meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified. Therefore, if any small business is interested in this requirement, please notify the POC prior to the response date and submit a complete response on how the offeror would provide holistic support for this population of NSNs to support the T64 Engine including a complete response to the Government Sources Sought. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and Small Business Administration Procurement Center Representative (SBA PCR), michael.massello@sba.gov. The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if sufficient information is received on how another offeror can provide holistic support for this population of items to provide the desired customer outcomes</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition for the TF34 Engine holistic requirement is for a Requirements, Fixed Price with Prospective Price Redetermination contract type. The term will be a five and one half year base period with a single, five-year option period. The total duration (base plus option period) shall not exceed ten and one half years. The estimated solicitation issue date is April 17, 2018 with an estimated closing date of May 16, 2018.</p>

<DESC>NSN 2540-01-598-1344, Foot Rest, Vehicular. This material is being procured in accordance with Cage 1XVN6 P/N 231257. The required quantity is 40 each to be shipped to DODACC (W25G1U) DLA Distribution New Cumberland, PA 17070- 5002. The required delivery is 165 days. FOB Origin and Inspection and Acceptance at Destination are required. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. This material is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested suppliers may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with the commercial item with 15 days of this notice. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of September 6, 2017(09/06/17). Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings /bid sets available. <br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, proposals will be evaluated according to "best value" procedures on the basis of Price, Past Performance and Delivery. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. <br />One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an agreement on Government procurement approved and implemented in the US. By the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. Preferred method to submit proposal is to upload through Dibbs. Submit e-mailed proposals to Kristina.Wolf@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

<p>Delivery to Bethesda, Maryland 20892 approximately one (1) from date of award.</p>
<p>The Genomic Analysis Core has brought single cell whole transcriptome sequencing to the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and now provides most VRC labs with the technology. Until now we have employed a process whereby cells are index sorted into wells of initially 96-, and 384-well plates. The whole transcriptomes provide not only gene expression signatures but also alternative splicing, polymorphisms and paired IgH/IgL or TCSA/TCRB sequences. This approach works well at the level of 100's to 1000's of cells and is appropriate for Ig probe-sorted cells or small cell numbers isolated from tissues. However, a number of projects have recently started which will require the sequences of transcriptomes form 1000's to 10,000's of cells. The 10X Genomics Chromium instrument is a state of the art machine that uses barcoded gel-beads and microfluidics to achieve this with very high efficiency. In its standard mode, it performs 3'-sequencing and thus gives an overall quantitative assessment of gene expression. Recently, the company has developed a new protocol which performs 5'-transcript sequencing and can thus provide paired IgH/IgL or TCRA/TCRB sequences. There is no other known company to have the extensive knowledge and expertise in the intricacies of transcriptome sequencing. 10X Genomics offers proprietary microfluidic circuits that rapidly partition input samples (e.g. high molecular weight DNA, single cells) which are then barcoded using GemCode technology. This technology is not available through any other vendor or instrumentation. This is the only known instrument in existence that will meet our need of increasing our work flow while allowing us to sequence thousands of transcriptomes in a single run.</p>

<DESC>In compliance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) &amp; 13.501(a)(1)(i) coupled with the provisions set forth by FAR Subpart 5.101(a)(1), this Notice is hereby published to inform of the following:
<p>In support of the Chicago District's purchase request, the Chicago District intends to award a sole source contract to VEMCO Division, AMIRIX Systems Inc. for ULTRASONIC TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS for telemetry monitoring of Asian carp and surrogate species in the CHICAGO AREA WATERWAY SYSTEM (CAWS) and ILLINOIS WATERWAY (IWW).</p>
<p>The applicable Size Standard is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 335999, with a Small Business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Chicago District intends to procure from VEMCO Division, AMIRIX Systems Inc., ultrasonic transmitter fish tags and receiver equipment to monitor Asian carp and surrogate species in the CAWS, in the vicinity of the Aquatic Nuisance Species Barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The movement and behavior of bighead carp, silver carp, and surrogate species will be monitored via telemetry to assess the threat to and effectiveness of the electric barrier constructed to stop the dispersal of aquatic invasive species.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic transmitters and receivers for telemetry monitoring is used to prevent Asian carp from establishing self-sustaining populations in the CAWS and Lake Michigan. The overall objectives are: (a) Determination of the distribution and response removal actions, (b) removal of any Asian carp found to the maximum extent practicable, identification, assessment and reaction to any vulnerability in the current system of barriers to prevent movement into the CAWS and IWW (c) determination of leading edge and reproductive success of those populations, and improvement of understanding the factors behind the likelihood that Asian carp could become established in the Great Lakes. Over the several past years, VEMCO Division, AMIRIX Systems Inc. has accordingly provided the fish tracking and monitoring equipment enabling researchers to study the behavior and migration patterns of marine and freshwater animals across vast distances. VEMCO's equipment is well-suited for implementation and auditory function.</p>
<p>Vemco is the sole developer, manufacturer and supplier of Vemco acoustic telemetry receivers, transmitters, receiver upgrades and receiver accessories and all associated software.</p>
<p>VEMCO, manufactures the ultrasonic transmitters that are exactly compatible to the VEMCO VR2 and VR4 receivers already deployed in the river by the Corps of Engineers and agency partners like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Southern Illinois University. USACE currently has over $250K worth of compatible equipment in the CAWS and IWW.</p>
<p>Vemco coded transmitters and monitoring receivers use Vemco owned proprietary technology and coding techniques. These are not based on an open standard. This technology provides vast numbers of unique tag IDs to allow for interoperability and compatibility of over 20,000 Vemco receivers deployed worldwide.</p>
<p>Vemco tag IDs and deployments are managed through the Vemco tag ID database which is solely owned and accessible by Vemco. The Vemco tag ID database is critical to the successful operation of Vemco acoustic telemetry studies.</p>
<p>VEMCO transmitters work well for the species of fish (bighead and silver carp) monitored by ultrasonic telemetry and for the duration of the monitoring period (2176 days).</p>
<p>It is operationally imperative that only VEMCO tags be purchased and deployed in the acoustic network installed in the Illinois Waterway. VEMCO protects against the use of cloned tags, which could compromise government research results. Competitors claiming to offer similar equipment have no way of knowing the tag numbers currently deployed in the IWW (currently over 1000 tags are in use), and the use of any other product besides VEMCO could jeopardize U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District work and acoustic network.</p>
<p>Under the proposed contract, the overall completion time will be 30 calendar days. The contract will result in a firm fixed-price purhcase order.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc. However, interested firms must send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN the close of business on April 17, 2018 at 4pm Central Time. Statements should be sent to the attention of anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil. Please ensure that the subject line of your email includes "Solicitation Number W912P6-18-Q-0007". Award is anticipated on or about April 27, 2016. This announcement is in accordance with FAR Part 5.101(a)(1). The point of contact is Anita R. Simpkins at (312) 846- 5370 or Regina G. Blair (312) 846-5371.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract modification for data storage services to Iron Mountain.

<DESC><p>The primary mission of the AN/ALQ-131/184 Electronic Countermeasures Pod is to identify and counter increasingly complex, diverse enemy air defense systems. The pods consists of a multitude of receiver, transmitter and signal processing sub-systems. In addition, several support tools and specialized test and measurement equipment (ALM-256 Intermediate Level Support Equipment (ILSE)) and ALM-233 Automatic Support Equipment (ASE))complete the overall system architecture. The system was first designed, developed, assembled and deployed in the mid-1970s with incremental hardware and data-flow upgrades since then. Since the early 1990s the AN/ALQ-131 and AN/ALQ-184 have been the primary defensive system for the F-16 and A-10 combat aircraft.</p>
<p>The Agilent 8757D SNA is currently used to perform period maintenance of the ALQ-184 and ALQ-131 Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) pods. The 85037A detector is used in conjunction with the SNA to take sweeping power measurements for both systems. Both the 8757D SNA and the 85037A detectors are no longer manufactured and are considered obsolete. The detector is a weak link item in the support equipment station and requires immediate repair.</p>

DESIGN
The ALSA wash basin is cast as a single piece solid sur- face and includes an integral faucet head. It is a ligature resistant and highly vandal resistant which makes it per- fectly suited for behavioral healthcare applications.
The ALSA wash basin comes with hidden activations and is intended for through wall installation.
Water can be activated by dual electronic piezo touch buttons, or infrared sensors. The water is dispensed via hot and cold aerated outlets or via a single tempered/ cold water outlet.
The ALSA wash basin is extremely tough, being made from the highest grade solid surface materials. This makes it ideal for high security healthcare environments where ligature and vandal resistance are preferred.

WATER MANAGEMENT
The water is most effectively managed by Wallgate by Intersan s comprehensive WDCA range of electronic con- trollers in conjunction with the piezo or sensor activation of the ALSA wash basin.

<DESC>Imaging brain sections using either confocal or widefield fluorescence microscopy is an essential step for experiments that are being carried out by many basic science investigators within the NIMH intramural program. The program recently acquired a Nikon C2 Confocal Microscope System. This is a basic system that lacks features such as motorized optical elements that facilitate sophisticated experiments that investigators would like to perform. The objective of this purchase is to upgrade that system to meet current and future requirements of intramural investigators. Specifically, the goal is to provide a programmable platform on which either widefield or confocal fluorescence microscopy can be efficiently performed and on which these modalities can be efficiently combined in the same specimens, so that rapid widefield scanning over tissue on multiple microscope slides can be used to guide high resolution confocal imaging.

<DESC>This special notice is a Synopsis of a Proposed Contract Action in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2 as the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. Accordingly, the Government intends to solicit from a single source for a commercial service purchase not estimated to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) in accordance with the authority at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) / Preparedness Section on behalf of the Emergency Management Institute (EMI), located at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), intends to contract on a sole source basis with the American Council on Education (ACE), located at One DuPont Circle, N.W., Washington, DC 20036. DHS / FEMA intends shortly after the expiration of this special notice to issue a non-competitive award with a period of performance that is estimated to be twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contemplated award is for ACE to review and evaluate the content of numerous NETC / EMI offered courses and for the subsequent college credit equivalency recommendations of those courses for vocational, associate, baccalaureate, and graduate credit. As ACE publishes and maintains for students' reference The National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training, the award shall also cover the maintenance and listing therein of all EMI courses that have ever received an ACE college credit equivalency recommendation.</p>
<p>Market Research has determined that ACE is the only source reasonably available due to ACE being uniquely positioned to assist an EMI objective of furthering the professionalism of the emergency management field as the ACE College Credit Recommendation Service (CREDIT) College and University Network consists of approximately 2,000 higher educational institutions that consider ACE credit recommendations. As such, an ACE review and evaluation of NETC / EMI courses provides NETC / EMI students with the broadest opportunity to use EMI courses as credit toward their educational goals in emergency management related degrees and only serves to increase the number and quality of emergency management related personnel to respond to emergencies in their communities.</p>
<p>This special notice is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation document yet exists for this requirement. All parties interested in receiving the subsequent solicitation, which will not be made available through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE), shall respond to this notice and:<br />1) Include information on the proposed services that clearly supports the above described requirements; <br />2) Fully explain your capabilities and qualifications by submitting a detailed capability statement that at a minimum must demonstrate the following: <br />&#61607; A comparable United States nationwide College and University network base (i.e. approximately 2,000 higher education institutions) that currently considers the Contractor's credit recommendations for transfer to degree programs.<br />&#61607; A comparable existence of relationships with United States educational organizations and related associations (i.e. approximately 1,800) whereby the Contractor represents and is supported by them in aggregate concerning higher education policies and issues. &#61607; The capability to publish and maintain an Online Guide that is publicly accessible and provides a current listing of all NETC courses that have received credit recommendations. This Guide must include course information for each course; i.e., course name, course code, length of course, course description, objective, learning outcome, credit recommendation.<br />&#61607; The capability to make award credit recommendations in various categories i.e. vocational, associate, baccalaureate, graduate and evidence these recommendations have been accepted by the Contractor's College and University network base. <br />&#61607; The capability to immediately provide an electronic transcript service as well as paper format transcripts, both of which can be sent to the NETC student's requested college or university.<br />&#61607; Acceptance of the credit recommendation given to NETC courses that were previously reviewed and recommended by another organization (ACE).</p>
<p>Responses to this special notice must be made in writing and submitted via email (using PDF, MS Word, Excel Attachments) to Gregory Keller, Contract Specialist, at Gregory.Keller@fema.dhs.gov. Responses must be received no later than the response date and time specified in this notice, and any late responses will not be considered.</p>
<p>All responses received by the closing date of this special notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to not conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this special notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for Gerber maintenance support in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to Gerber Technology. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: Gerber Technology. Lt Col Peter A.

<CONTACT>Tiffany Holmes, Phone 4789260335, Email tiffany.holmes.2@us.af.mil
<DESC>SOLICITATION AF3QCCM8026A001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ)
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F3QCCM8026A001. This solicitation will be solicited under Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD<br />(a)NAICS: 325510<br />(b)No. of Employees: 500<br />(c)Dollars:</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: <br />CLIN 0001: Purchase AC-828-C-PERC-TAN IAW attached Purchase Description. <br />Estimate of Annual Quantity: 24 drums/year</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to Tiffany Holmes (tiffany.holmes.2@us.af.mil) no later than Thursday, 05 April 2018, 4:00 pm EST. The anticipated award date is 01 May 2018. Please do not request award status prior to this date.</p>
<p>Manufacturer: AC Products, Inc.</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only: <br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure chemical AC-828-C-PERC-TAN to support the AMFF Plating Shop. The Plating Shop was designed and constructed to minimize employee exposure to hazardous substances, while also increasing plating technology and capability for electroplating F-15, C-130, C-17 and C-5 aircraft components. AC Products produces a proprietary chemical used in the AMFF. This chemical has been used in Robins AFB plating facilities for years and has been proven to produce the finish coatings required to meet Air Force technical requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. Proprietary chemicals for the same process are not compatible with each other and the chemicals cannot be comingled. Should a new proprietary chemical be acquired, the chemical solution in the active processing tanks will need to be drained before the new chemical can be inserted into the tank. This would result in acquiring between 650 gallons to 7500 gallons, instead of the small quantities needed for routine maintenance.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS (IAW FAR 13.303-3)<br />1. This is a "Blanket Purchase Agreement" (BPA) which is a simplified form of a monthly charge account. If awarded, you will be authorized to provide Chemicals, in accordance with the attached Schedule and Price List, when called by the designated representative(s) for 60 months after receipt of award.</p>
<p>2. It is understood and agreed that this BPA obligates the government only to the extent that authorized calls are actually made against it and then only when delivery against such calls has been completed.</p>
<p>3. BPA contractors shall be selected based on the proposed prices. Pricing shall be balanced and reasonable. The Government reserves the right to determine balance and reasonableness based on historical buys for similar product and quantity. Contractors are urged to provide pricing that is as low as or lower than those charged to their commercial customers for comparable terms. These prices must be reasonable or the government will reject the quotes. In addition, the government request contractors propose a discount for quantities of material purchased. Discounts will be used as credits for material purchased in the following year. Example, contractor A proposes 1% discount. If contractor A receives call orders for $250,000 of material, then a credit of $2,500 shall be applied to additional material purchased in the following year. The discount will be for purchases of like kind material. This discount will be used in the evaluation of potential vendors.</p>
<p>4. Each individual call under this agreement shall not exceed $25,000 per call. (Each Vendor must respond with pricing and delivery information via email within 3 days)</p>
<p>5. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor a list of individuals authorized to purchase/request service under this BPA identified by organizational component, and the component, and the dollar limitation per purchase for each individual.</p>
<p>6. Each delivery will be accompanied by a delivery ticket which will contain all of the following information (as a minimum):<br />a. Name of supplier.<br />b. BPA number.<br />c. Date of call and call number.<br />d. Name of person placing the call.<br />e. Itemized list of supplies/services furnished.<br />f. Quantity, unit price, and extension of each item, less applicable discount.<br />g. Date of delivery.</p>
<p>7. A summary invoice shall be submitted at least monthly or upon expiration of the BPA, whichever occurs first, for all deliveries made during a billing period, identifying the delivery tickets covered therein, stating their total value, and supported by receipted copies of the delivery tickets.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p><br />1. Price <br />2. Meeting or exceeding the salient characteristics (Pass/Fail basis)<br />3. Past Performance</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 -- EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014):</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive acquisition IAW FAR Parts 12 and 13. Evaluation of quotes will be conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures IAW FAR Part 13.106. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Solicitation Requirements. All quotes submitted will be reviewed for completeness to determine if they contain all information requested in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1. Quotes that are incomplete or missing information may be excluded from the evaluation. Quotes that comply with the solicitation requirements will be considered responsive and evaluated as shown below:</p>
<p>a) Price Evaluation. Quotes will be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each CLIN. The unit price of the vendor's quote shall control any conflict between the unit price and the extended amount submitted in response to this solicitation. No advantage will accrue to a vendor who quotes an unrealistically low price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b) Meeting or exceeding the salient characteristics (Pass/Fail basis)</p>
<p>c) Past Performance: <br />(i) Past performance will be evaluated IAW DFARS 252.213-7000, Notice to Prospective Suppliers on Use of Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting in Past Performance Evaluations (June 2015) and IAW FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(A) "the contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired.".</p>
<p>(ii) PPIRS-SR collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier's performance history. The PPIRS-SR application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance. The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in PPIRS-SR will be used by the Contracting Officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired. In the case of a supplier without a record of past performance history in PPIRS-SR, the supplier may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for its past performance history. The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>(iii) PPIRS-SR classifications are generated monthly for each contractor and can be reviewed by following the access instructions in the PPIRS-SR User's Manual found at https://www.ppirs.gov/pdf/PPIRS-SR_UserMan.pdf. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications only. Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications.</p>
<p>2. Award will be made to the quote with the lowest evaluated price that meets or exceeds the salient characteristics on a pass/fail basis IAW FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal, and the quoter must have a favorable or neutral rating in PPIRS-SR. If the lowest price quote passes technically and the quoter has either a favorable or neutral rating in PPIRS-SR, that quote represents the best value for the Government, and the evaluation process shall stop at this point. An award will be based on a best value of price and past performance provided by responsive and technically acceptable quotes. An award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quotes. The evaluation process will continue in this manner until a vendor's quote passes the technical evaluation and has a favorable or neutral past performance rating. If no quotes are considered technically acceptable or all quoters have an unfavorable past performance rating, the solicitation may be canceled.</p>
<p>3. Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced.<br /><br />(End of Addendum)</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Scissors Bandage Utility. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1611-16_Scissors_ Bandage_Utility are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Scissors Bandage Utility products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1611-16_Scissors_Bandage_Utility. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 19 May 2018. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1611-16_Scissors_Bandage_Utility, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Scissors Bandage Utility.<br /><br /><strong>Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.</strong><br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Scissors Bandage Utility. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $315,644 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1611-16_Scissors_Bandage_Utility who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br /><strong>Pricing analysis of required items will occur for only those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL.</strong> Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. The best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. An IA will only be issued once the Vendor has established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line. Failure to establish approved DAPA base uncommitted prices will preclude a vendor from establishing an IA with the government. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br /></strong>1.	Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br />Required Products /	Annual Usage in Units /<br />1.	SCISSORS BANDAGE UTILITY 7.0 INCHES TO 7.5 INCHES LONG BLACK HANDLE /	52,124 /<br /><br />2.	Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs, and factor PV costs into their offered IA tier pricing.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):<br /></span>MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Mr. Joe Winter, 210-536-6072, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price, technically acceptable quotation.</p>

<p>NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received.  Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1.

It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.

<p>6.	If the Contractor's representations and certifications in SAM.gov do not reflect the NAICS code governing this solicitation, Contractors must submit documentation that they are a small business under the NAICS code governing this solicitation.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016) NAM</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-70 CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS NAM</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>
<p>1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items 
ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS:

Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made based on the best overall quote that is determined to be the overall best value to the government. Pursuant to FAR 52.212-2, the criteria for evaluation is: (1) Price, (2) Technical Capability. 

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet or exceed the technical capability requirements of the statement of work shall not be selected regardless of price.

Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the provided quote meets the technical capability specified above in the List of Line Items / Salient Characteristics / Statement of Work. Technical Capability shall consist of meeting or exceeding the requirements in the List of Line Items / Salient Characteristics / Statement of Work.

Options (if requested); The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s)

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to quote their best non-price and pricing quotes in their initial submissions. However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. If these communications take place, the Government is not obligated to communicate with every contractor (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply; therefore, formal discussions are not applicable). All contractors will be treated fairly and impartially. A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further communication if its non-price and/or pricing quotes are not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the Government based on a best value determination.
 
All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so forth and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

Quotes that merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement shall be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor quoting the lowest price, or to the contractor with the most highly technical quote. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote, if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to the merits of one or more of the non-price factors.

(End of Addendum to 52.212-2)

Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications   Commercial Items, with the offer.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The Government has determined that best value will be achieved by using a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable approach to determine best value.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

A. Technical Approach; 
B. Price

Additional evaluation information:

Technical- The contractor shall provide a high level outline that demonstrates their ability to provide onsite maintenance services for 3 Astrophysics X-ray Inspection Machines in accordance with the Description of Need. The outline should be no more than two (2) pages. As part of Technical, contractor should provide evidence that their personnel have been trained/certified to work on Astrophysics X-ray Inspection Machines.

Price- Price will not be evaluated adjectivally or assigned a score. Price will be evaluated to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. The Government expects that price reasonableness will be established through adequate price competition, but it may also determine price reasonableness through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 13.106-3. The Government will evaluate quotes, by adding all established pricing elements (inclusive of options) to determine the final/total price.

Although Past Performance is not evaluated as a separate evaluation element, the Government will consider past performance when performing its responsibility determination of the apparent awardee.

<p>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>

<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 -- EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014):</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive acquisition in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. Evaluation of quotes will be conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Solicitation Requirements. All quotes submitted will be reviewed for completeness to determine if they contain all information requested in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1. Quotes that are incomplete or missing information may be excluded from the evaluation. Quotes that comply with the solicitation requirements will be considered responsive and evaluated as shown below:<br />a) Price Evaluation. Quotes will be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The unit price of the vendor's quote shall control any conflict between the unit price and the extended amount submitted in response to this solicitation. No advantage will accrue to a vendor who quotes an unrealistically low price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b) Meeting or exceeding the salient characteristics (Pass/Fail basis)</p>
<p>c) Past Performance: <br />(i) Past performance will be evaluated IAW DFARS 252.213-7000, Notice to Prospective Suppliers on Use of Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting in Past Performance Evaluations (June 2015) and IAW FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(A) "the contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired.".</p>
<p>(ii) PPIRS-SR collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier's performance history. The PPIRS-SR application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance. The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in PPIRS-SR will be used by the Contracting Officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired. In the case of a supplier without a record of past performance history in PPIRS-SR, the supplier may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for its past performance history. The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>(iii) PPIRS-SR classifications are generated monthly for each contractor and can be reviewed by following the access instructions in the PPIRS-SR User's Manual found at https://www.ppirs.gov/pdf/PPIRS-SR_UserMan.pdf. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications only. Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications.</p>
<p>2. If the lowest price quote passes technically and the quoter has either a favorable or neutral rating in PPIRS-SR, that quote represents the best value for the Government, and the evaluation process shall stop at this point. An award will be based on a best value of price and past performance provided by responsive and technically acceptable quotes. An award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quotes. The evaluation process will continue in this manner until a vendor's quote passes the technical evaluation and has a favorable or neutral past performance rating. If no quotes are considered technically acceptable or all quoters have an unfavorable past performance rating, the solicitation may be canceled.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014) applies to this acquisition. <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price;<br /><br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror.<br />To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br /><br />10.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.<br /><br />(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.<br /><br />(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.<br /><br />(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent <br />practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that <br />information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<br /><br />(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD--<br /><br />(1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;<br /><br />(2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;<br /><br />(3) To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;<br /><br />(4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or<br /><br />(5) To a support services contractor (``recipient'') that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.<br /><br />(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD.

The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable <br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.<br /><br />(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--<br /><br />(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The <br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and<br /><br />(2) Require subcontractors to--<br /><br />(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and<br /><br />(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>

<p>Description of requirement: The Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG) requires a contractor, with documented past performance, to migrate its current Access Control System (ACS) environment over to Cisco ISE as well as integrate dynamic authentication and authorization capabilities into their existing infrastructure, leveraging Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

This project will migrate the current ACS environment, initially install ISE into the environment for 802.1x in a proof of concept capacity, test and document the use cases developed with the FLARNG, and perform informal training on the as-&shy;built system for preparation of the FLARNG to install into the production network. The vendor will also assist the FLARNG with a limited scope test rollout moving into production. For the wired network, up to 96 ports on up to 2 switches will be configured for authentication, authorization, and profiling.</p>

<p>NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received.
