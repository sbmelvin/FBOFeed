Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

NESC: http://www.standards.ieee.org/nesc<BR><BR>(a) U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan. This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision. 

(b) The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that: submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible – and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period – for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation. 

(c) To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the “Vendors Login” module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>(1) The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period. 

(2) Failure to be approved in JCCS – and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels – or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance. Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority. 

(d) Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commander’s inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority. Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions.<BR><BR>(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A

(c) Responsibilities of the vendor carrier representative, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker: 
1. Afghanistan Import Customs Clearance Request Procedures: The carrier, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker is responsible for being knowledgeable about the Afghan Customs Clearance Procedures. 

2. Status of Customs Clearance Requests: All inquiries regarding the status of a customs clearance request prior to its submission to Department of Defense (DoD) Customs and after its return to the carrier representative or shipping expediter should be directed to the carrier or shipping agent. 

3. Customs Required Documents: The carrier representative or shipping expediter is required to provide the DoD Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with all documentation that will satisfy the requirements of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).

1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while en route to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.<BR><BR>2. Imports: Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number. The following documentation is required for all import shipments:  An original Customs Clearance Request (CCR) prepared by the COR in accordance with Afghanistan customs guidance referenced in paragraph 4 below. 

a. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in “US Military”. This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA). 
b. Shipping Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker. 
e. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. 
f. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract. 
g. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA. 

3. Exports: The following documentation is required for all export shipments: 
a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR. 
b. Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. 
4. Customs requirements from the GIRoA may change with little notice. For current detailed instructions on customs guidelines in Afghanistan, refer to “The Instruction for Customs Clearance Request (Import/Export) Operations.” In all cases, the carrier is required to obtain a copy of this document, found at the following link: http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf<BR><BR>(a) Pursuant to the authority of USCENTCOM FRAGO’s 09-1567 and 10-143 this contract is awarded in Afghani (local currency), if awarded to a host nation vendor.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
