Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>The 3d Infantry Division requires a Document Management Services  Solution to provide lease and maintenance of new Multifunctional Devices (MFDs) on a firm fixed price.   Fort Stewart estimates approximately 540 MFDs will be placed in the initial phase of this program. MFDs will be configured with copying, network printing, scanning, facsimile and tailored to the needs of each organization/customer entity. During the life of this contract, the Government expects to add or remove an undetermined number of MFDs as requirements change due to organizational realignment or organizations added or deleted or combined.  Price shall include lease, maintenance, services, staples, toner and supplies (except paper).  All excess copies will be pooled together on a quarterly basis and will not be billed to the government until the excess charges exceed the collective total number of the minimum quarterly copy volume per MFD which is a total of 4,480,000 impressions per month. Quote shall contain a detailed breakdown of cost for equipment and services.  The government will not accept bid proposals with coterminous pricing for new copiers installed after the initial installation date and throughout the contract period of performance.  All new copiers will be added to the contract at the price quoted on the RFQ throughout the period of performance.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Karl Storz Endoscopy-America, Inc., 2151 E. Grand Avenue, El Segundo, CA 90245-5017, as the only responsible source that can provide Operating Room (OR) Integration Systems.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.  It is anticipated that resultant of this Notice of Intent to Sole Source, a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be established.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) at Bethesda has a need for Operating Room (OR) Integration Systems for their simulation, hybrid, and general ORs.  The integration products shall consist of a combination of the following components: CCU, printer, light source, DICOM key, thermoflator for insufflation, monitor, HD connections, router, hybrid-single platform operating integration system, touch panel, ceiling speakers, audio communication, S-video telestration, HD-video teleconferencing, additional display installation kits, cables/ fiber cables of multiple lengths,  room overview cameras, peripheral device remote, AIDA interface, remote PC interface kits, mouse extenders, scan convertors, wired microphones, iPod audio interface, site drawings, media convertors, flat panel monitors, adapters, and touch panels.  These systems shall be able to integrate the medical equipment in the operating room environment.  

Other components of the integrations systems include: software to collaborate all patient information during the surgical procedure, portable robots that attach to the booms in the OR for use in training, telestration software to be used for training purposes, a center that allows for videoconferencing and keeps track of room status for all ORs, and a software system that allows for the aggregation of healthcare information systems throughout the hospital for use to the surgical team. The equipment shall work with the installed base of Karl Storz endoscopic equipment.  The equipment shall be compatible with Essentris software already installed at the facility.

Karl Storz Endoscopy is the only manufacturer that can provide an OR integration system for the ORs at WRNMMC at Bethesda.  Due to the renovation and construction of the new facility at the current NNMC Bethesda campus, all ORs need a system to integrate the equipment and then track the equipment in each room, individually.  The Karl Storz OR integration system is the only system that can provide telepresence technology.  This technology is a telemonitoring, telecollaborating, teleconsulting, and telestration robotic system that can be mounted on an arm in the surgical field.  This technology will allow for decreased human error and increased patient safety in the operating room environment as it increases teaching abilities.  No other vendor can provide a training option in the surgical environment that is portable and allows for telestration.  Karl Storz is also the only vendor that can provide device control on their Karl Storz minimally invasive surgical endoscopic equipment.


Items being purchased in this acquisition:
OR Integrating Systems (3)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334510 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Pierce, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3098 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2950 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 2/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the

 32 paved surface parking spaces

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<RESPDATE>111910
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order, on a non-competitive basis, to Dr. Deborah Ann (Bravo) Colosi, 6218 Wagner Lane, Bethesda, MD 20816, for professional services&nbsp;in support the NIMH's NeuroAIDS Therapeutic Initiative. This acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Therapeutic approaches have realized much success in managing HIV/AIDS, however strategies to prevent or treat the neurological complications that frequently accompany HIV disease have been less successful. This is due to limited availability of drugs across the blood brain barrier, the high degree of toxicity that accompanies long term use of current antiretroviral drugs, and the co-morbid mental health conditions that frequently accompany HIV/CNS disease, such as depression, anxieties, mood disorders, as well as others. While the extreme manifestations of AIDS dementia complex have decreased in frequency, less severe but nevertheless debilitating neurological complications persist. This is particularly important as individuals with HIV are living longer with compromised ability to function, also exacerbated by the normal aging processes in an increasing proportion of this population. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA) proposes to expand the therapeutics program by developing several initiatives to identify new therapeutic targets emerging from basic HIV neuropathogenesis research, and foster the pre-clinical and clinical testing of these drugs through mechanisms supportive of these approaches. <br /><br />The vendor shall perform the following tasks:<br /><br />
<p>1. Develop several funding announcements which are part of an integrated strategy to expand on the development and testing of new therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of the neurological consequences of HIV/CNS disease. <br /><br />2. Respond to writing or report requests from the NIMH Office of Director or other requesters relating to the NeuroAIDS portfolio as needed. This includes, but is not limited to, responding to congressional writing requests from OD relating the NeuroAIDS portfolio and Trans-NIH therapeutic information requests.<br /><br />3. Grant or contract related write-ups as needed. This includes, but is not limited to, scientific justifications for Form 1820, professional services contracts, consultant agreements, administrative supplement justifications, brief summaries of grants marked for interest in preparation for pre-council meetings, concept and Program initiative write-ups. <br /><br />4. Research, planning, coordination and implementation of Program development, conferences and workshops as needed. These include scientific conferences as well as meetings with multi-site projects (NNTC, CHARTER). <br /><br />The contractor will conduct the background research for these announcements, and consult with the COTR weekly to discuss current scientific approaches, ongoing clinical trials, and optimal strategies that should be incorporated into these announcements. During these meetings, the PO will assess progress and make suggestions. The duration of these meetings with the COTR might last up to 3 hours. In addition, the contractor will assist Program in the implementation and management of the next phase of these contracts with the NNTC.<br /><br />Finally, the contractor will provide technical and scientific assistance to the COTR in management of the applications that arrive in response to the FOAs. This includes assisting in programmatic review of the science proposed in the applications and assisting in the management of the applications which are selected by peer review for funding.<br /><br />Dr. Colosi has more than 5 years experience working as a Senior Research Scientist at Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. During that time, she participated in all aspects of the process of moving drugs from bench to bedside. This includes developing and overseeing the protocols and strategies for testing and assessing the effectiveness of specific drugs as well as reviewing progress and making recommendations for future work. This experience has given her a good understanding of the science and process necessary to move therapeutic agents from bench to bedside. In addition Dr. Colosi has a strong background in basic science, including biochemistry and virology, as seen by her doctoral and post-doctoral research experience, which is essential to understand the complexities of targeting therapeutic interventions to HIV-mediated cell dysfunction. The Division of AIDS Research currently lacks this expertise in the drug development process and yet the need for a strong programmatic approach to the therapeutics in NeuroAIDS is critical. Dr. Colosi brings scientific and drug-company expertise to this effort, which is currently not available among the program staff of the NIMH-DAR.<br /><br />Dr. Colosi has been researching the current state of therapeutic approaches to managing HIV/CNS disease over the past&nbsp;12 months and has written an extensive review of this area. In addition, she has convened a meeting with some of the leaders in the field to review our current efforts and develop a set of recommendations for next steps. Given the extent of her knowledge, Dr. Colosi is considered uniquely positioned to move the NIMH's proposed approaches to the next phase. Not only does this initiative require knowledge of the field, but it also requires an understanding of existing programs at NIMH in order to leverage resources and maximize use of limited funds. Dr. Colosi has had past experiences with the workshops that she convened. Dr. Colosi's previous work for the NIMH has been outstanding and her continuation is critical to the development of this important program to improve the lives of individuals living with HIV. It is determined that Dr. Colosi is the only known source qualified to perform the required services. No other sources will satisfy the agency's requirement.<br /><br />The period of performance is to be ten (10) months from date of award. Place of performance is to be at the NIH main campus located in Bethesda, Maryland 20892. This is a fee-for-service type acquisition. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, interested party may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 1:00 PM E.T., November 19, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Please reference announcement number NOI-1838880 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Systems Integration  Owego (LMSI-Owego), 1801 State Route 17C, Oswego, NY 13827-3900, for the acquisition of eleven (11) Technology Insertion Common Console (TICC) production kits (part number 287A900-1).  The TICC is for the employment of all five Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) sensors to support the organic AMCM mission of the MH-60S helicopter.  This procurement includes an option for the purchase of twelve (12) additional production TICC kits during fiscal year 2012.  This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons.  LMSI-Owego is the designer, developer, and original fabricator of the TICC.
    This effort is the acquisition of production units of a major system of highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Given the complexity of the TICC, the lack of a baseline established through a Physical Configuration Audit, and the level of system knowledge required to provide production support of the TICC, LMSI-Owego, is the only source possessing the requisite expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering, production, and quality of service to accomplish all tasking.  The NAICS Code for the procurement is 334511, the FSC Code is 6605.  The small business size standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to solicit Transas USA Inc located at 18912 N Creek Pkwy, Suite 100, Bothell, WA 98011-8016 on a sole source basis for item: one (1) lot Transas Navisailor Basic Chart Maintenance Site License.  The Site License includes chart corrections and dongles each quarter for a period of one year from date of contract.  The basis for the sole source purchase is that the conversion to any other charting system would require the duplication of training that has already been provided for this system and would entail a similar licensing agreement.  It would not be cost effective to perform this conversion; therefore Transas USA Inc, is the only approved source for this requirement.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The basis of award is a fair and reasonable price to the Government.  Award of action will be on or about 15 November 2010.  This support will be delivered to the Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group Four, 2220 Schofield Rd, Bldg 117 Norfolk, VA 23521-2485.  NAICS CODE: 334111

<DESC>Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," to 10 CFR Part 50, General Design Criterion (GDC) 2, "Design Bases for Protection Against Natural Phenomena," requires, in part, that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety must be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. This includes not only the effects of shaking, but also possible shear or volumetric deformations in the underlying geologic foundation materials. Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites," provides guidance on seismic assessments, but currently provides minimal guidance on how to conduct deformation assessments. <br /><br />Traditionally, site performance has been assessed using the assumption (either implied or explicitly) of one-dimensional (1D) propagation of waves, at both an element level and a site-scale level. These 1D analyses often include assessments of both seismic shaking and of seismic deformations. However, over the past decade or more, there has been a significant increase in the awareness that this may not always be appropriate (and is possibly un-conservative) in some cases. <br /><br />On an element level, there is a fundamental understanding that soils are sheared in three dimensions during earthquakes, although very limited research has been performed to assess the related multi-dimensional effects. This is true in part because specialized equipment (i.e. multi-directional simple shear) is required and the large majority of testing is performed using the more common 1D or 2D equipment. There are currently very limited datasets of bi&not;directional simple shear laboratory testing to elucidate the effects of multi-dimensional loading. However, the limited research that has been performed on dense sands to date indicates that current modeling tools, which are based on early unidirectional testing, will under-predict deformations in sandy materials in some cases. Understanding the true potential deformations in dense sandy materials under multi-directional loading is essential for undertaking reliable performance-based assessments of nuclear installations. Dense sands and sand mixtures are the most common soil types found at proposed non-rock nuclear sites. Because some multi-dimensional element level simple shear laboratory testing results have served to highlight the critical importance of developing a better understanding of multi&not;dimensional loading in deformation-focused performance-based engineering, the NRC is initiating a coordinated research effort to address several inter-related issues related to multidirectional loading of nuclear sites. This request for proposal is part of that effort. Using tools, such as high-end soil-structure-interaction methods, the impact of 2D and 3D seismic loading on a nuclear power plant and its site, including the effects of soil deformation on the structural foundation and piping, can be analyzed. However, undertaking these analyses requires 3D material constitutive models. Unfortunately, as a result of the general lack of multidirectional laboratory data available, there has been limited development and validation of soil constitutive models focused on 3D loading. This project addresses this need by undertaking both the testing and modeling tasks needed to further develop existing constitutive dense sand models. <br /><br />The NRC is currently also undertaking a separate program to develop a new open-source Soil&not;Structure-Interaction (SSI) modeling tool based on the OpenSEES platform for the purpose of undertaking collaborative and in-house research on performance-based design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). New multi-dimensional dense sand models are needed for this upcoming SSI research. Models developed in the project described here must be compatible with this OpenSEES-based platform. <br /><br />In addition, there is now an understanding that the element-level behavior of sands under multi&not;directional loading (in terms of modulus degradation and damping curves) is sometimes very different than under 1D loading and is a function of ground motion rotation in addition to loading. Currently the NRC has a separate cooperative program with the Bureau of Reclamation underway to develop new multi-dimensional site response tools focused on the impacts of multi&not;directional loading on shaking. Efforts will be made by NRC staff to bring synergy between these projects to the degree possible. <br /><br />The objective of this contract is to investigate an area of seismic performance in which recent work has shown that current tools and methods may be un-conservative. This work will improve understanding of the behavior of dense sands and sandy material under multi-dimensional loading through appropriate laboratory investigations. This work will then develop one or more multi-dimensional dense sand constitutive models to be used in more accurate soil-structure &not;interaction of potential seismic deformations in soils at nuclear power plants sites that are subjected to seismic loading. <br /><br />The results of this work will develop part of the technical basis for an update of Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites" Currently the guide notes that deformation assessments must be undertaken, but provides little guidance as to how that is done. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about November 22, 2010, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

Vendors can obtain more information on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) by clicking on the following link to our Vendor's Guide:<br /><br />http://www.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html<br /><br />Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. <br />The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. <br /><br />The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $6.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541690.<br /><br />Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort. Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Project Description: Construction pre-solicitation for the FY10 Congressional Add MCA PN059978/329828, Analytical Chemistry Wing (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.<BR><BR>Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational. The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials. Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints. Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.<BR><BR>The proposed procurement is unrestricted. NAICS: 236220 with a business size standard of $33.5 million. Estimated cost of services is between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about November 23 2010, to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.

Award will be made to approximately six-contractors for a contracting period of one base year plus for one year options.

Below are the specifications for the items being procured.SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIESThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may make up to six separate awards.  VA infrastructure is limited to six vendors to be located behind the firewall and thus VA may not make any more than six vendor awards on the combination of these items.

Items (1) and (11) must be offered together in order to be considered for the award along with all mandatory sub-items of items for (1) and (11).B. All IT, data and server requirements are mandatory for all line items, as further outlined and described in the Section 4.0 and Attachments A, B, C of the SpecificationsC.

<DESC>TITLE: MQ-1 and MQ-9 Aircraft Systems and Subsystems <br />
<p><br />DESCRIPTION: SOURCES SOUGHT: The United States Air Force (USAF) intends to award multiple development, production, retrofit and sustainment contracts to include support for organic depot activation efforts, for the&nbsp;MQ-9 aircraft system including its subsystems as well as multiple development, retrofit and sustainment contracts for the MQ-1 aircraft system&nbsp;for the time period Fiscal Year (FY) 12 through FY18. The contractor shall have the capability to develop, manufacture, sustain, retrofit and provision the MQ-1 and MQ-9 systems, subsystems, components, ground support equipment, communication equipment and spare parts including performing testing, deployment and Contractor Logistics Support both in the continental United States and outside the continental United States. The current fleet includes 268 MQ-1 aircraft and 83 MQ-9 aircraft. The production contractor will be required to produce and deliver between 34-48 MQ-9 aircraft per year starting in FY12 through FY17 and 36 MQ-9 aircraft in FY18 for a total of 324 MQ-9 aircraft.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Defense has classified both the MQ-1 and MQ-9 programs as Acquisition Category ID programs. The MQ-1 program, initiated in 1994 as an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration competitively awarded to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Incorporated (GA-ASI), was initially led by the Navy, and transitioned to the Air Force in 1998. This platform has been a vital asset in the Global War on Terrorism since 2001. The MQ-9 program was initiated in 1998 as an Independent Research and Development effort by GA-ASI to build upon the successes of the MQ-1 program and provide additional system capabilities. The GA-ASI is presently the prime contractor/integrator and is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and sustainer of both the MQ-1 and MQ-9 air vehicles and ground control stations. Raytheon is the designer, developer, manufacturer and sustainer of the Multi-spectral Targeting Systems (MTS), the primary Electro-Optical/Infrared sensors, for both platforms.</p>
<p>The MQ-1 and MQ-9 platforms were developed with significant private funding from GA-ASI, the Original Equipment Manufacturer. The MTS for both platforms was developed with significant private funding from Raytheon. Subsequently, the USAF has 1) limited rights (as defined by Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7103-5) to the technical data for significant portions of the MQ-1 and MQ-9 aircraft systems, subsystems and hardware components and 2) restricted rights (as defined by DFARS 227.7203-4) in the computer software for the MQ-1 and MQ-9 aircraft systems including its subsystems. The Air Force does not have a re-procurement data package available as a result of the aforementioned technical data and software rights restriction.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of providing the supplies and services described herein. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources. The Medium Altitude UAS Division will be assessing the level of market interest and competitiveness to this acquisition based on responses to the following: 1. Does your firm have knowledge of the entire MQ-1 and MQ-9 fleet including the MTS and communications equipment (Include past performance ratings/evaluations such as Contractor Performance Assessment Ratings, Award Fee Determinations, or similar contract incentives to verify this assertion)? 2. Do you have past experience with the MQ-1 or MQ-9 or similar aircraft/programs? 3. Does your firm have qualified personnel and facilities available to support onsite and overseas maintenance/sustainment and logistics support activities for both MQ-1 and MQ-9, this includes supply of all aircraft spares? 4. Can your firm manufacture the MQ-9 to current design and specification requirements at rates of 34-48 aircraft per year with all needed spares and support equipment beginning in October 2011? 5. Can your firm support multiple complex development efforts including integration of appropriate weapons, resolution of current operational issues for both MQ-1 and MQ-9 in accordance with Global Air Navigation System/Global Air Traffic Management requirements, continue migration to secure common data links, continue to improve secure voice capability, field new Electro-Optical Infrared, radar, and signal intelligence sensors on both the MQ-1 and MQ-9 platforms beginning in October 2011?</p>
<p>Contractors responding to this shall submit the following information to the Medium Altitude UAS Division by 19 Nov 2010: 1. Company information to include: a. Points of contact, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers; b. Identification as a large United States (US) business, small US business, or a foreign business. 2. A summary of the company's related capabilities information based upon responses to the questions in the aforementioned paragraph. 3. A rough-order-of-magnitude estimate of the dollars and time required to obtain the capabilities to support the requirements listed in this sources sought synopsis.</p>

Pages shall be single-spaced and one-sided. The font shall be Times New Roman and no smaller than 10pt with at least a one-inch margin. Please submit your responses electronically to 703aesg.syk@wpafb.af.mil in a Microsoft Word compatible file. Capabilities will not be accepted on the telephone.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The government will not reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their response. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties, on an as required basis, for further clarification on material provided.

<DESC>OFFICE OF SECURITY TECHNOLOGY<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />RFI-NAS-001-2011<br />INTRODUCTION<br />The Federal Bureau of Prison (BOP), is seeking information on potential solutions to actively or passively prevent inmates from utilizing any form of contraband electronic communications device (i.e. a cell phone) in order to communicate with anyone outside our secure perimeter. This is to include, but not be limited to detection, jamming, spoofing, denial of service, managed access, direction finding, scanners, hand-held frequency detectors, voice recognition, non-linear junction detectors, pico and femtocells, etc. <br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist BOP in formulating its requirements. <br />BACKGROUND<br />The BOP has three basic requirements to prevent inmates from using cell phones: <br />1. The equipment must work without impacting or collecting information from the general public who are located outside the secure perimeter of our facility. <br />2. The equipment must work with all cellular phone protocols / frequencies.<br />3. The overall cost of equipment and installation must be at a reasonable cost.<br />The BOP is only interested in equipment that meets our requirements and is a &lsquo;commercial off-the-shelf' (COTS) solutions. The BOP does not fund technology research. <br />DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the BOP's requirements are invited to submit detailed specifications. If multiple products are suggested as part of the solution, please indicate how the equipment functions together and include a system diagram. In addition to the equipment specification sheets and product literature, please answer the questions below. .
<p>Please respond to these questions, for each specific piece of equipment: <br />1. Is the equipment covert and can it be hidden from inmates? <br />2. Describe its physical characteristics: <br />a. Describe its physical characteristics.<br />b. Include: height, width, depth, weight<br />c. Are there multiple pieces of equipment in your solution? <br />d. Antenna<br />3. What legal issues could hamper the use of your system and have to be resolved before it could become operational?<br />4. Does the equipment function on all US cellular bands and/or frequencies?<br />5. What is the equipment's minimum and maximum detection distance? <br />6. Does the equipment rely on a direction finding solution?<br />7. How sophisticated / complicated is the equipment to operate for non-technical staff? <br />8. How does the system ensure it is only working with cell phones within the secure facility?<br />9. Are there features or components of the equipment that we will not need to use in order to remedy this problem? <br />10. How will the equipment work to provide coverage for both indoor and outdoor areas of a prison compound (campus) with 50-60+ acres and dozens of building including three, four-story inmate housing units? <br />11. Is all of your suggested equipment COTS available within three months? <br />12. Are there any potential health issues possibly associated with your equipment when used constantly (24/7/365) in the direct vicinity of confined inmates?</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received will be for internal use within BOP and will not be published. Responses to this RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>HOW TO RESPOND<br />Responses and any inquiries regarding this RFI shall be emailed, in PDF format, no later than Friday, November 19, 2010 at 9:00 a.m EST. to the attention of Pat Donahue-Ormandy, Senior Contract Specialist at pdonahueormandy@bop.gov or Douglas Shoch, Contract Specialist at dshoch@bop.gov.</p>

<SOLNBR>NINDS-SS-10-04

<CONTACT>Laurie A Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov - Helene C Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email hb106s@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p>PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying sources with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to develop an interim platform for providing access and functionality to the Neuro-QOL, which is an instrument for assessing quality of life outcomes in neurological disorders. The Neuro-QOL instrument was developed under a contract that ended on September 30, 2010 with delivery to the government of all instruments, programs, algorithms, and related documentation. In order to make the instrument available for researchers to use, a platform needs to be developed to support access, implementation, and maintenance. In the near future NINDS expects to release a solicitation for long-term maintenance of the Neuro-QOL. Thus, in order to make the instruments and documentation available to researchers to begin testing and using Neuro-QOL, as well as to potential offerors to aid in their proposals for a future solicitation, we need to have an interim platform that will be publicly available.</p>
<p>The NINDS anticipates initiating a contract to design and develop a web-based platform that will allow researchers or clinicians to create study-specific web-based data collection pages; will include all Neuro-QOL instruments that include Computer Adaptive Testing for administration to research participants; will provide for scoring and exporting of data; and will provide technical support and consultation to researchers on the use of Neuro-QOL instruments, including data collection and data export functions. In addition, the contractor will be required to conduct up to three training sessions/workshops to introduce researchers to the development and methodology of Neuro-QOL, provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research. We anticipate that this will be a one-year undertaking to complete all requirements.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: On September 30, 2004, NINDS awarded a contract to develop a psychometrically robust health-related quality of life (HRQL) measurement tool that is accepted by the neurology clinical trials and clinical research communities. The contractor developed, tested, and completed validation of the required instruments and has provided all required deliverables. As of September 30, 2010, 13 adult and 9 pediatric item banks or scales, totaling more than 700 questions, were delivered to NINDS, along with supporting reports, a comprehensive user manual, and a plan for sustainability of Neuro-QOL. The feasibility of the sustainability plan and subsequent deliberations and decisions by NINDS will determine the best way to manage the distribution and delivery of Neuro-QOL so that it is freely available to the NIH-sponsored clinical research community. To some degree, sustainability is enabled through posting print-ready instruments on the Neuro-QOL website for download; however, this does not provide the user with a system for administering a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) or collecting other Neuro-QOL short-form instruments online. Simply posting the instruments also does not provide for the substantial need for expert consulting in their use and interpretation and the technical support required by clinical researchers who wish to use Neuro-QOL but may lack expertise in patient reported outcomes measurement.</p>
<p><br />INFORMATION REQUESTED: With consideration to the above, the NINDS is requesting the following specific information as part of our market research efforts in support of this potential requirement. Your organizational technical abilities and related scientific and managerial experience/capabilities in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to: 1) establish a web-based platform to make available for public access the Neuro-QOL instruments, CAT, and scoring algorithms; 2) provide technical support and consultation to researchers in the use of the Neuro-QOL materials, including data collection and data export functions; 3) provide ongoing technical support and consultation with respect to research design, instrument selection, analysis and interpretation; 4) host the Neuro-QOL website, refining and upgrading the website's quality and functionality, and improving Neuro-QOL's visibility targeting appropriate components of the research community; 5) conduct training sessions and/or workshops to introduce researchers to the development and methodology of Neuro-QOL, provide education on IRT, CAT, and item bank construction, and train investigators in the use of the web-based Neuro-QOL platform in their research.</p>
<p><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside or an open competition to include both large and small business, a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees. Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52-219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard designated for this project.</p>
<p>All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Educational Institution, Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a).</p>
<p>If submitting hard copies, please send to: Laurie A. Leonard, Contracting Officer, National Institutes of Health, NINDS R&amp;D CMB, 6001 Executive Blvd., Suite 3287, Bethesda, MD 20892-9531 or via courier to Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.

<DESC>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought announcement to assess the interest and qualifications of large AND small business firms including Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns, Certified 8(a) Small Business Concerns and Certified HUBZone Small Business Concerns, in competing for a contract for an anticipated procurement entitled "ASPHALT CONCRETE PAVING - AIRFIELD" at all U.S. Federal and military installations on Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. The information provided will be used to determine whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted). The information provided will not be disclosed out of the agency and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted per the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 15 and 36. The anticipated contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The project includes providing experience, personnel and a capability to perform 1) Survey and testing, 2) Demolition and disposal of existing asphalt-concrete pavement, base material, topsoil and vegetation, 3) Embankment/Sodding/Hydroseeding, 4) Airfield/Roadway PCC Concrete/Asphalt Pavement, 5) Airfield Pavement line striping/markings to include reflective/thermoplastic tape pavement markings and/or rubber removal, 6) Surface Inlets/Ditches/Storm Drain Lines/Manholes 7) Other miscellaneous airfield work. The above general description of work does not in any way limit the responsibility of the Contractor to perform all work, plant, supervision, management, quality control, labor, tools, equipment appliances and material and performance in strict accordance with specification, drawings and subject terms and conditions of each task order and the basic contract. The estimated performance period of the contract will include a one-year base period with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods. The maximum value of all work will be limited to $50M over the life of the contract. Tasks under the contract are estimated to vary in size from $2,000 to $10,000,000. The contractor must be Department of Transportation certified. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this anticipated procurement is 237310 with a small business size standard of $33,500,000.</p>
<p>WHO MAY RESPOND: Interest in this Sources Sought announcement is open to both large and small business prime contractors, relative to the primary NAICS code 237310. Following review of the responses to this notice, and if the Government still plans to proceed with an acquisition, the Government will develop an acquisition strategy to determine whether the solicitation for this project will be issued as a set aside for 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB or Small Business Concerns OR if the solicitation will be issued as Unrestricted to both large and small business concerns. <br />Note to Small Businesses: Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, provided that each team member meets the small business size standard for the acquisition and are deemed capable. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is a reasonable expectation of at least two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a "significant amount" of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract. Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA. A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business (SDVOSB) prime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVOSB contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other SDVOSBs. A joint venture of at least one SDVOSB and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVOSB procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. A qualified Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone) prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone small business concerns. A joint venture of two or more qualified HUBZone small business concerns may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone. Further information regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125).</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties should submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact below no later than close of business -4:30 p.m. Chamorro Standard Time (GMT+10) on 19 Nov 2010. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. This contract will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued technical, maintenance and design support of the AFCS database.  Combatant Commanders, Army Component Commands, Joint Forces Command, Department of the Army Engineer, Training and Doctrine Command, Headquarters US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), other MACOMs, USACE Divisions and Districts, Army Engineer units (both active guard and reserve), and other Government agencies have tasked the AFCS Branch to perform studies and develop austere contingency designs and support data.  AFCS designs are reviewed and updated to utilize unique state-of-the-art technology in construction designs, materials, and techniques within Army transformation to conserve resources. The AFCS database enables users to adapt required building materials to local climates.  The AFCS design library contains simple and standard temporary facility designs that require minimum engineer support to be assembled. These designs allow non-engineer troops or indigenous labor to perform the majority of the work which enables the engineer to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.  The unique and highly specialized services provide support to the global war on terrorism (GWOT), disaster relief, and contingency theater operations.<BR><BR>The Government is performing market research in order to determine sources available that possess the capability to execute the kind of work identified above prior to issuing a request for proposal.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential offerors who possess the potential for work efforts required to address systems engineering, testing, certification, management tasks, and documentation required for modernizing Marine Corps Combat Operations Center (COC) hardware in conjunction with the implementation of the COC Services Oriented Infrastructure.    

The Marine Corps seeks to provide commanders, at all levels, with the means to operate decisively despite uncertainty.  The Marine Corps employs the MAGTF Combat Operations Center (COC).
  The COC is a common, modular, and scalable operational entity that facilitates C2 across the full spectrum of MAGTF operations.  The COC is based on an approved Mission Need Statement (MNS) dated 29 May 1996 and from this MNS, two Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) were derived:  The Command Center (CC) ORD dated 26 December 1997 and the Combat Operations Center (COC) ORD dated 25 May 2005 (Change 7).  The Marine Corps has fielded a family of systems to provide the COC capability at each MAGTF element and level of command. 

The COC supports the primary operational agency required to control the tactical operations of a command employing ground and aviation combat, combat support, and combat service support elements.
  The COC provides transportable C2 facilities for the commander and staff of the Command Element (CE), Ground Combat Element (GCE), Aviation Combat Element (ACE), and Logistics Combat Element (LCE) in support of MAGTF operations.  The COC minimizes the number of distinct equipment configurations to improve logistics supportability, while maximizing operational flexibility and suitability for required echelon-specific functionality.  There are three fielded COC system variants (V), all designed using a building block approach: (V)2 (Division / Wing / Marine Logistics Group Level), (V)3 (Regiment / Group Level), and (V)4 (Battalion / Squadron Level). 

The current production model of the COC is the Model F.
  Future COC capabilities will be included as Marine Corps Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) upgrades to the existing Model F hardware configurations to meet COCs Service Oriented Infrastructure (SOI), server virtualization, integration of Tactical Data Systems (TDSs), and the adoption of available services produced by 3rd Party Developers (development efforts of other program offices).

Potential offerors would perform all tasks required to design, develop, integrate, test, produce, manufacture, train, deliver and prepare documentation and technical manuals associated with COC hardware modernization upgrades and COC reproduction requirements identified by the Government.  The potential offeror would need to provide all materials, equipment, hard tooling, personnel, and facilities necessary to manufacture, fabricate, integrate, produce, and deliver the types and quantities of deliverables specified by the contract.
  Upon successful completion of developmental test, operational test, first article test, the Government may exercise contract options for integration, production, fielding, and sustainment.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Marine Corps is seeking to identify potential vendors.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement not to exceed 5 pages to PG 11 Contracts at PG11_COC_CONTRACTS@usmc.mil.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining an acquisition strategy.  The strategy developed based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 

No phone calls will be accepted.  All responses must be made electronically and must be received no later than 17 November 2010 at 5:30 PM EST.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make America safer. The DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland.
<p>DHS S&amp;T's Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD) supports the DHS mission by developing and transitioning capabilities that are successfully demonstrated to improve the security of our nation's terrestrial and maritime borders.</p>
<p>A recently completed Borders and Maritime Surveillance Report recommended DHS S&amp;T create a roadmap to guide investments in future sensor technologies linked to specific homeland security capabilities needed one-to-two decades hence. An investment strategy for sensor technologies would leverage S&amp;T's limited funds with those of DOD, DARPA and similar entities. The goal is to bring more capable sensors to the field earlier. A long-term vision for an end state capability, coupled with stable funding, is key to achieving capabilities with a worthwhile cost-to-benefit ratio. A surveillance roadmap would serve to document that vision, to link near- and far-term programs that build toward that final end state, and will enable a long term investment strategy for achieving funding stability. DHS will use the information gathered from responses to this RFI and subsequent presentations (as requested by DHS) to recommend funding for future sensor development.</p>
<p>See attached Request for Information (RFI) for details.</p>

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the following under FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and compelling urgency). TSA has a requirement to provide full repair of 3000 sq ft TSIF Facility chiller area exterior wall surface located at the Ronald Reagan National Airport.
<p>TSA is citing unusual and compelling urgency due to anticipated winter weather conditions at the TSIF site. The required wall materials will not bond below the 50 degree temperature mark. The exterior repairs must be completed during day time weather conditions at 50 degrees or higher. Several leaks have been discovered in the 2nd floor office cubical area and if they continue to go without repairs, greater damage will occur. The Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority currently identifies Ivory Associates and Pioneer Roofing Security access to airport building roof areas. No other vendors currently are provided access to airport building roof areas and the Air Operations Area (AOA), which is located to the rear of the TSIF facility and will require access for this repair.<br /><br />Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a purchase order to Ivory Associates, 3 Hillard Court Poolesville, Maryland 20598. Phone: (240) 447-3949. This purchase order will address the requirements to repair of 3000 sq ft TSIF Facility chiller area exterior wall surface located at the Ronald Reagan National Airport.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the<br />Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the<br />authority of FAR 6.302.2. Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been reviewed and approved in accordance with established TSA procedures and is hereby published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.305. Any and all redactions in this published document (that is, language marked out or deleted) have been identified and confirmed by the Government as contractor proprietary information which the Government must protect from unauthorized disclosure.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The service contract wage determination applicable for the location of the proposed hotel facility will be made a part of any resulting award if FAR clause 52.222-41 is determined to be applicable.  Each offer shall indicate if credit card (VISA) is an acceptable form of payment.  Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to bid every line item.  While multiple awards will be considered, vendors may enter into subcontract agreements with other facilities and submit one quote for all requirements.  In determining the most advantageous scenario, the government will evaluate pricing as follows: 1 - Each line item will be evaluated separately.  2 - If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging, conference, catering, etc.) for all line items and offers the overall lowest price, one award may be made to the one vendor. 3 - If no one vendor can accommodate all lodging, catering, and/or conference facilities for this event, in order to be advantageous to the government, the lodging facility(ies) must be located within a one mile radius (radius according to mapquest.com) of the facility determined to offer the LPTA conference quote.  For example, if a conference facility in Richmond, VA is able to meet all conference requirements for the event and is determined to be the low conference price, but is not able to meet the lodging requirements, only hotels within a one (1) mile radius (radius according to mapquest.com) will be considered for award, unless no cost transportation is provided by the hotel located outside of the one (1) mile radius. 4 - An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards.  This monetary evaluation factor is separate from determining the number of facilities needed to be utilized to meet the requirement which will also be considered in determining if it is advantageous to make multiple awards.  For purposes of price evaluation, if there is a mathematical error in which the unit price multiplied by the quantity does not equal the extended total, the unit price will prevail and be used for evaluation and award purposes.  To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met: 1) The quote must provide for all services which are being quoted (i.e. if quoting the conference, contractor must be able to provide conference space, catering, support equipment, etc.).  2) Hotel(s) must have on-site parking for at least one vehicle per room reserved or provide off-site parking within a three (3) city block radius.  The conference facility shall have parking for 400 vehicles. 3) Facilities being proposed for lodging and conference must be located within a 30 mile radius of 500 Dove St. Richmond, VA (radius according to mapquest.com).  4) Lodging facility must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement 1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost and a conference space accommodations chart must accompany the quote. For minimum requirements 2) & 4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made to ascertain if minimum requirement 3) can be met.  If the information required is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  Pricing shall be provided on attached pricing worksheet.  Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Should any term or condition (i.e. number of hours prior to event attendee may cancel reservation, etc.) be altered, offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the governments best interest to accept the proposed alternative. In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided.  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rates proposed by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable offer. Contractors can and are encouraged to provide room rates below the established per diem rate.  As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. All questions shall be submitted in writing and received by 4:00 p.m. ET, November 16, 2010.  Questions can be sent via email, susan.p.hensley@us.army.mil or fax (434) 298-6202. Quotes are due not later than 4:00 p.m. ET, November 19, 2010.  Quotes may be faxed to 434-292-6202, Attn: MSG Susan P. Hensley, or emailed to susan.p.hensley@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks to commission an architectural and engineering firm to maintain and modernize the legacy of Building 1 at the NIST Boulder Campus in Boulder, Colorado. This project is to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees.
<p>In this context, NIST announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with NIST quality standards and requirements. The NAICS for this project is 541310. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />Building 1 at NIST Boulder (also known as the Radio Building) was constructed in 1954. It serves as the main laboratory facility for research and measurements at NIST Boulder, supporting the NIST mission to provide measurements, standards, and technology that advance economic growth and address national needs. Building 1 comprises a total of 300,000 square feet, and includes administrative and support staff offices as well as laboratories. Building 1 includes a wide range of laboratory facilities that support research and measurements in areas such as electronics, nanotechnology, time and frequency measurements, quantum computing and quantum communications, laser science, optics, superconducting sensors, radio-frequency communications, magnetic field measurements, and many other areas. In many of these areas, NIST Boulder performs the world's best research and measurements, including the world's leading quantum computing research programs, the world's most accurate atomic clocks, and some of the world's most sensitive measurements using unique superconducting devices. Building 1 also includes two clean room facilities for the fabrication of unique nanoscale instruments that are used for NIST Boulder research and measurements. The extremely demanding and sensitive research and measurements performed in Building 1 require tight control of environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, humidity, and air quality.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the Building 1Renovation (B1R) are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954. Renovation of Building 1 is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately half of Building 1, including Wings 3, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. This will provide 80,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The B1R consists of enhanced temperature control down to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, vibration control, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will address components such as lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The B1R will locate the bus ducts in the service corridors. Chilled water, steam, and compressed air will be supplied from the Boulder site Central Utility Plant. Communication elements that will be addressed include infrastructure components such as telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include components such as fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction will comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for a Lead Architect/Engineer for the Renovation of Building 1, a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building that would meet the following requirements. Provide pre-construction services to include detailed cost estimating of a $40 - $80 million construction contract for the Building 1 Renovation on a federal campus. In addition to cost estimating, the selected A/E shall provide constructability reviews, value engineering recommendations, provide design reviews at the various design submittal stages for two years. Due to the size of the project, the Architectural-Engineering (A-E) firm's contract with NIST is projected to range from $3.5 to $5 million dollars for design services to include all architecture, engineering, hazardous material/soil testing, inspections, laboratory de-commissioning standards, survey work, coordination with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and municipalities. The A-E shall have past experience in the same scale of renovation projects and provide sufficient references for successful project completions of multiple projects ranging between $30 and $60 million. The A-E shall be familiar with the use of Integrated Project Delivery through the use of Building Information Modeling which will benefit the government during the entire life cycle of the building. This experience shall include renovations of occupied space including but not limited to Domestic Water, Fire Suppression Water, Sanitary Sewer, Storm Water, High Voltage Electrical, Telecommunications, and Security. The A-E shall be familiar with hazardous material removal methods including removal and containment that meets both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Colorado's Department of Environmental Health Protection Division. <br />Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. The finished environment shall be supportive of internal collaboration and informal interaction and shall be energy efficient. The complexity of the program is evident from the numerous and diverse research divisions and support organizations located on the campus.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. NIST estimates that 65% of the design will fall under the engineering discipline while the remaining 35% will fall under the architectural discipline. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), (BIM) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of existing laboratories and the construction of interior and exterior upgrades, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units.</p>

<p>A contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract as a result of SSA making an unfavorable suitability determination on contractor employees.&nbsp; Additionally, if SSA determines that the number or percentage of unfavorable determinations make successful contract performance unlikely, SSA may terminate the contract for cause or default.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp; Exceptions<br />The COTR may request an exception to the normal background investigation process for emergency situations when access to a facility or site is needed, but where access to information systems or programmatic information is not required.&nbsp; This request must be directed to CPSPM.&nbsp; COTRs may request an exception by sending an email to dchr.ope.hspd12appeals@ssa.gov.&nbsp; If CPSPM grants temporary access, that temporary access will apply only for the period specified by CPSPM and only for the specific contract employee(s) identified by the COTR.&nbsp; CPSPM expects that it will rarely grant exceptions.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp; Contractor Notification to Government<br />The contractor shall notify the COTR (who will notify CPSPM and the CO) within one business day if an employee is arrested or charged with a crime during the term of this contract, or if there is any other change in the employee's status (e.g., the employee leaves the company; the employee no longer works under the contract; the employee's alien status changes) that could impact the suitability determination for that individual.&nbsp; The contractor must provide in that notification as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to:&nbsp; employee name(s), contract number, the type of charge(s), if applicable, the court date, and, if available, the disposition of the charge(s).</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; Government Control<br />The Government has full control over and may grant, deny, or withhold access to a facility, site, system, or information and may require the COTR and contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract for reasons related to conduct even after the individual has been found suitable to work on the contract (see paragraph n., below).</p>
<p>m.&nbsp; Appeals Process for Unsuitable Determinations<br />The contractor must notify the employee of any unsuitable determinations as soon as possible after receipt of such a determination.&nbsp; If the employee would like clarification or wish to appeal an unsuitable determination, his/her request must be in writing and submitted within 30 days of the date of the unsuitable determination.&nbsp; The request can be emailed to SSA at<br />dchr.ope.hspd 12 appeals@ssa.gov, or mailed to:</p>

<p>n&nbsp; Removal From Duty</p>
<p>SSA may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working under the contract based on conduct that occurs after a pre-screening approval or favorable suitability determination.&nbsp; The contractor must comply with these requests.&nbsp; The Government's determination may be made based on, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set forth below:&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located on the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSA Bethesda) - formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) - in Bethesda, Maryland, has a requirement for a comprehensive five-year assessment of the President of the University. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46.
<p>See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, firm fixed price contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database</strong></span><strong>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR, please see CCR's website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the President of the University over the past five years.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement for the President that was established by the Board of Regents (BOR) in May of 2010. Comprehensive assessments have not been accomplished to date. Only annual self-assessments have been done by the President, for the Board, over the past four (4) years. This year marks the President's fifth year. The requirement calls for a qualified outside contractor to perform interviews and review the President's performance against the goals he established - which were subsequently approved by the BOR - and then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the BOR.</p>
<p><strong>University Information:</strong><br />Established by U.S. Congress in 1972, this federally funded university educates and trains uniformed healthcare practitioners for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the U.S. Public Health Service. The university's F. Edward H&eacute;bert School of Medicine (SOM), the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN) and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute are located on the campus of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland).</p>
<p>The School of Medicine awards the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree to uniformed candidates and its graduate programs award master's and doctoral degrees to uniformed and civilian candidates. The Graduate School of Nursing, established in 1993, awards master's and doctoral degrees in nursing to uniformed and civilian candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />The assessment shall be based upon interviews with selected individuals and a review of the President's performance opposite his self-described goals that were approved by the BOR (to be provided only upon requests sent to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil). Interviews may be conducted in person, via email, or by telephone. All interviews are to be conducted anonymously.</p>
<p>The offeror shall use their past experience, their stated method, and the provided statistics (see below) to compile a list of interviewees. Internal individuals that should be interviewed will consist of university leaders - deans, vice presidents, senior vice presidents, and department chairs. External individuals may consist of the Uniformed Services Surgeons General (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Public Health Service), board members, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD/HA), and the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. For complete university statistics, please see the statistics section below.</p>
<p>The assessment will include a comprehensive review of the President's past goals and accomplishments, and it should also include recommendations for future actions and priorities. The evaluation shall cover the following topics: leadership; research; teaching; professional development of the faculty and staff; and communication. The assessment shall also include a comprehensive account of the President's strengths and weaknesses, along with recommendations for improvement in all assessment categories, and an account of how the University has changed under his direction.</p>
<p>The offeror must provide a written review and verbal presentation of the assessment in a closed session of the full Board of Regents on May 20, 2011. An electronic draft shall be sent to the BOR 30 days prior to the presentation date to ensure all aspects of the assessment have been addressed in full. The presentation will be conducted in the USUHS Board Room, D3001, at the University, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the offeror will prepare the final review in a written format of their choosing with the number of pages determined by the extent of their findings. Offeror will deliver five (5) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy prepared in Microsoft Word&copy;.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong> November 30, 2010 (anticipated award date) through May 20, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities of the President:</strong><br />The President of the University is appointed by the Secretary of Defense, and serves as the chief executive officer of the nation's only federal Medical School and Graduate School of Nursing. The President is responsible for the quality of the university's academic programs and extensive research programs, and provides oversight to the Deans and Program Directors to assure achievement of the university's mission. As the principal advocate for the university within both the federal government and academic communities, the President provides innovative leadership and guidance for obtaining extramural funding to advance the university's research programs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the President shall have: a demonstrated track record of leadership and accomplishments; the background and experience to lead a complex health-sciences research university; a terminal degree similar to those awarded by the university and a record of academic achievement with credentials sufficient to be appointed as a senior faculty member in at least one of the two schools; experience with military healthcare; and the background, experience and character traits to credibly represent the university within the federal government and within academic communities.</p>
<p>The position of the USUHS President is in the excepted service of the federal civil service and is subject to applicable U.S. government personnel regulations.</p>
<p><strong>University Statistics:</strong><br />&bull;  Number of current students: 1,037 (681 MD; 163 GSN; 158 Graduate Students; 35 post-grad dental)<br />&bull;  Number of current chairs: 30 (SOM 20 and 3 Directors; GSN 2 and 5 Directors)<br />&bull;  Number of current faculty: 329 (208 Civilian, 121 Military), plus 3,999 off-campus adjunct<br />&bull;  Number of current staff: 617 (461 Civilian, 156 Military)<br />&bull;  Number of current Regents on the Board: 15 (9 appointed, 6 ex. officio)<br />&bull;  Number of current VPs: 2 Sr. VPs, 5 VPs, 1 Director of AFRRI, 1 Brigade Commander<br />&bull;  Number of current Deans: Four - 1 SOM, 1 GSN, 2 Dental (1 Navy, 1 AF)<br />&bull;  Number of current Assoc Deans: 8 SOM, 2 GSN, 1 Vice Dean</p>

Corporate Experience - Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their experience in performing past assessments of presidents of academic institutions that include a medical school. This should also include information regarding the offeror's experience performing their quoted method of assessment.</p>
<p>Offerors are required to provide resumes of key personnel involved with the assessment. Quote must state which position and duties each individual is responsible for. Offerors must indicate whether resumes provided are current employees or possible future employees.

<p>2.    Technical Approach - Offeror's methodology for completing assessment. Offerors shall describe their method(s) of assessment. If citing named methodologies, please include a description of what it entails and how the plan will be implemented.</p>
<p>This portion shall include a milestone chart depicting each step of the assessment (from award of contract to final completion of assessment), how long each portion will take, and who will be working on each portion.</p>
<p>3.       Past Performance - The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance within the past three (3) years. Offerors must provide a minimum of three (3) customer references on contracts of similar complexity, scope, dollar amount, and type. The customer references must complete the attached past performance survey and email a copy to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by noon, 19 November 2010</span>.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure past performance surveys are received by the due date</span>.</strong> Any survey included in the quote package, but not emailed to pierre.smith@usuhs.mil will not be considered. Offerors may provide additional information to support past performance history, but not in lieu of the past performance surveys required. USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance. A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable past performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternate sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>4.       Price - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offerors must provide a firm fixed price quote</span>.</strong> For price analysis purposes only, offeror shall provide a detailed break-down of the hourly rates for each position, and the number of anticipated hours for each individual.

<p>All quotation packages shall be clearly marked with the quotation number, tax identification number (TIN), DUNS number, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address (if available).</p>
<p><strong>Funds Availability: </strong> FAR Part 52.232-18 - AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)</p>
<p>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Offeror receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p><br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.<br />(b) The Contractor shall --<br />(1)<br />(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or<br />(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;<br />(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;<br />(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;<br />(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;<br />(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and<br />(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to provide a market analysis that will determine the most likely products and clients for the new facility and establish a Master Plan based on identified demand.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Secretariat of Ports is charged with port master planning and development, regulatory framework, and operations and management of port authorities in the country. In order to accommodate an expected increase in vessel traffic, this feasibility study will develop a VTMS installation plan at four of the country's busiest ports. The proposed selected ports are Rio de Janeiro, Itagua&iacute;, Rio Grande, and Salvador/Aratu.</p>
<p>This feasibility study will provide the roadmap and guidelines for the acquisition and installation of VTMS at each of the selected ports to help Brazil track the vessel traffic on its coast, as well as reduce the possibility of collisions between vessels and collisions of vessels with offshore structures such as oil rigs. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this Feasibility Study are attached as Annex 5.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $674,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Portuguese and English directly to the Grantee by 1:00 pm (local time), December 22, 2010 at the above address. Annex 6 does not need to be translated in Portuguese. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>Site visit is confirmed for 15 Nov @ 0850. Solicitation close date is 19 Nov @ 1200 mountain time. The solicitation has the wrong date in it and I will accept quotes until the solicitation posting close-out date. Below are driving directions to the range for the site visit.<br /><br />the gate you are looking for is the main gate for Dugway Proving Grounds. On the letter attached from the Det 1 Lt Col Keene, it gives directions on how to get there from Salt Lake. It says:
<p>There are two main routes into DPG:</p>
<p>a. Route 1 (mountain pass suitable for small vehicles): From I-80 take exit 99 southbound toward Tooele on Hwy 36. Go south for approximately 21 miles to Hwy 199. Turn right on Hwy 199 and continue for approx. 24 miles through Johnson's Pass to the Dugway main gate.</p>
<p>b. Route 2 (suitable for hauling purposes): From I-80 take exit 77 southbound. Go south on Hwy 196 through Skull Valley for approximately 38 miles to the Dugway main gate. Be aware that you will be traveling through open range country with horses and cattle free ranging.</p>
<p>Also, the work being accomplished will be on the South Range accessed from Dugway Proving Grounds. This will NOT be taking place on the North Range (Oasis).</p>

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for project planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking information from industry to be used for the development of specifications and the Statement of Work (SOW) for the future purchase and installation of a trash rake cleaning system.
The Parker Dam power plant is located near the left abutment of the Dam facing upstream.  Water flows to the power plant and passes through a fore bay inlet trash rack structure into an excavated fore bay channel, and then through the penstock intakes which is equipped with individual trash racks.  None of the existing trash racks have provisions for regular cleaning.  	
The accumulation of current and expected debris will increase alongside with the infestation of quagga mussels and aquatic plant life.  As a result, the need of a trash rake cleaner is required at the forebay inlet structure which will provide the necessary requirements to; execute in cleaning the trash racks bars by removing accumulated quagga mussels/aquatic plants, alleviate low flow velocities, and retrieve collected debris.  Debris removal will be most effective at this location.
The existing trash rack roadway is 236 feet-long, 12 feet 4 inches wide and with a maximum weight load of 10 tons.   The trash rack structure is comprised of 12 bays, each section have two sets of trash racks.  Each section is 61 feet high and 8 feet in width.  A 24 inch concrete wall separates each trash rack section.  There are 16 trash bars for each rack, measuring at 6" x ?" and evenly spaced at 5 inches.  Interested parties may include, but are not limited to, vendors and both commercial and government customers.  A draft sketch, drawings and a list of materials for the trash racks will be provided upon request.

The NAICS code for the work described below is 339999 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees. Work is anticipated to begin in the Summer 2011 and extend up to 5 year period.  The total work effort is estimated at $35,000,000.00.   It is anticipated that task orders would be awarded for the exhibit fabrication and installation within the first 2-1/2 years.<BR><BR> The work involves all the exhibitory, including but not limited to: cast figures, exhibit lighting, artifact cases, exhibits, graphic panels, graphics, immersive settings, hardware, minimal audio production, etc.  Contracts have already been awarded for the production of audiovisual films and interactive media by the Army Multimedia and Visual Information Directorate.  However, the associated hardware will likely be included under this contract, and possibly the hardware integration.  This is in support of the NMUSA to be located in Fort Belvoir, Virginia (http://www.nmusa.army.mil/).  The NMUSA will be a unique facility of national and historic significance.  It will encompass a state-of-the-art building housing world-class exhibits that tell the story of the U.S. Army as an institution and be a tribute to the American Soldier.  The NMUSA will preserve, study, and interpret Army material culture, educating visitors in the history, traditions and accomplishments of the Army.  It will be a forum for the education, edification, and inspiration for all those seeking knowledge of the history of the Army.  The American people will gain a greater awareness of the part that the Army played in shaping their heritage.  <BR><BR>The NMUSA building and campus will be constructed in phases and will initially consist of approximately 185,000 gross square foot facility that houses 50,000 net square feet for nine exhibit galleries and a theatre.  It will also include: an education center, an auditorium, food service and retail areas, and administrative space.  Exterior features will include a parade ground, amphitheater and memorial garden as well as landscaping and parking.  NMUSA will be expected to attract a steady state attendance of approximately 600,000 visitors annually. <BR><BR>Throughout the exhibition spaces, there will be macro artifacts (supported on the floor and hung from the ceiling), scenic elements, immersive settings, cast figures, supporting exhibitory elements, exhibit lighting, demising walls, exhibit casework, graphic panels with images and custom illustrations/cartography, and exhibit hardware. Hardware includes, but is not limited to, all screens, projectors, monitors, speakers, kiosks, cabling, expansive interactive tables, multi-monitors with touch-screen or motion detection technology, and all associated exhibit housing.  The exhibitory shall create a memorable experience for visitors to the NMUSA that promotes repeat visitor ship. It is expected that the nature, extent and quality of exhibits and environments envisioned for NMUSA should meet or exceed that of other national history and military museums of similar size.   Capabilities of the Exhibit Fabricator firm should include, but are not limited to: project management, (including close coordination with several Government agencies and firms working on the project), fabrication and installation of:  scenic elements, immersive settings, cast figures, exhibitory, exhibit lighting, demising walls, exhibit case work, graphic panels, hardware and possibly its associated integration. Parties interested in providing fabrication and installation services for the NMUSA project should submit a written notice to this office outlining your capabilities and experience providing comparable fabrication and installation services to those described herein. <BR><BR>Interested firms should respond to the following questions: <BR><BR>1. Does your company have experience in the fabrication of museum exhibits?<BR><BR>2.  Demonstrate your capability to effectively manage approximately $20 million worth of fabrication related work simultaneously.  <BR><BR>3. Have you participated in a project of similar scope, magnitude, expected superior quality and project complexity, to include state of the art exhibitry in the 21st Century?  <BR><BR>4. If Yes to questions above, please describe at least three project examples indicating: scope, project responsibilities, prime or subcontractor (or teaming approach/use of subcontractors/responsibility of each/percent of project completed by each) contract amount, contract timeframe, square footage of exhibit space, year of contract, customer (private/ government), type of museum (i.e., history, military history, science, etc&) and any other pertinent information.<BR><BR>5.

They were mounted to L-867B bases, which have a 10-1/4-inch diameter bolt circle, by means of an adapter ring. Contemporary in-pavement lights are designed to mount to L-868 bases which have an 11-1/4-inch bolt circle.  L-867 bases do not have a large enough opening to accomodate the below grade portion of modern in-pavement lights, but they have enough lip to drill and tap 11-1/4-inch bolt circle to accommodate the new fixture.

<DESC>Abbreviated Justification and Approval Document
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
of Requirements Not Exceeding $550,000 ( IAW FAR 6.304)

1.  Contracting Activity: VISN 15 Network

2.  Description of Action: Replacement of Fire Pump and associated hardware

Requirement:	1  New 	0  Repeat
Pricing:	1  Firm-Fixed Price          0  Time & Materials	0  Cost

Name of Proposed 
Contractor:  National Fire Suppression 	
Street Address: 501 Sunshine Road 	
City, State, Zip:  Kansas City, KS  66115	
Phone: 913-321-9208 	

3.  Description of Services:  The estimated value of the proposed action is $74,002.50. Describe the services or supplies, including make & model number, to be acquired below.
Location: Basement of building #1, Kansas City VAMC, 4801 Linwood Boulevard, Kansas City Missouri.
Removal and replacement of existing 1,000 GPM @80 PSI fire pump and associated controllers. Replacement pump to be Aurora Model 5-481-75 (brand name or equal). Replacement controllers will be new auto transformer style.
Removal and replacement of existing jockey pump and controller.
Due to an active fire hazard urgent time constraints require a sole source. 
4.  Authority Cited:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following, but other exceptions may be used.)   

0  (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements OR

1  (b)  10 USC 2304(c)(2) or 41 USC 253(c)(2); FAR 6.302-2:  Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: (State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.)

0  (a)  Services can only be provided from the original source as this is a follow-on requirement
for the continued provision of highly specialized services.

0  (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the
Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

1  (c)  Services/Supplies are needed immediately to satisfy mission requirements.

       (d)  Additional Information:

(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?
A  fire Hazard has been identified here at the KCVA.  The fire pump in question is no longer functional at this point. Joint Commission Life Safety Standards will be violated as well as a substantial potential for fire hazard to the facility and occupants of the Medical Center.

(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?
If another contractor is selected there will be unacceptable loss of time in learning the existing systems which would amplify an unnecessary risk to fire hazard to the facility and its occupants.

6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)
