The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G% servers have been identified as key component of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure.  IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.  These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel.  In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.  As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing 0&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups area matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.  Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economics of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers required for SMART have been identified as key components of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

<DESC>In order to accomplish the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Flight Plan goals for development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System, the Office of System Engineering (AJP-1000) requires on-site, systems engineering, graduate-level courses for the Air Traffic Organization's (ATO) workforce. For the past few years, the FAA has obtained these courses from Steven's Institute of Technology (SIT), Hoboken, NJ.   SIT was selected as the service provider after an extensive market analysis of New Jersey's accredited engineering colleges and universities.  The search was limited to schools located in the State of New Jersey because, to date, all the courses have been taught at the William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ and there was a need to minimize the instructor's travel costs.  The search criteria also stipulated that the school had to:    Be an accredited College and/or University;   Have an accredited School of Engineering with an accredited System Engineering and Engineering Management Program at the graduate levels;   Offer courses in non-traditional instructional formats, i.e. distance learning, week-long classes in a  modular format that condensed 16 weeks of traditional academic course lecture time and delivered it within a five-day, 40-hour time period;.    Supply full-time professors (not adjunct) for all classroom instruction; and    Include the cost of the instructor's travel expenses and all required books and other instructional materials in their tuition rate. SIT was the only school that met all the above criteria.  The classes offered by SIT are delivered onsite, in the modular lecture format and supplemented with an additional eleven weeks of professorial guidance to students.  During this time, students work on class assignments and papers and the professor is available for consultation to all students.  The modular format minimizes employee time away from productive engineering work while simultaneously achieving the Flight Plan goal of upgrading the skills of the future aviation workforce.   Finally, SIT met the most important consideration, i.e. they had an extensive, widely-recognized and innovative graduate-level systems engineering curriculum. The FAA plans to continue offering graduate level engineering courses to the ATO workforce for the next five years and intends to issue an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to SIT on a single source basis with SIT.  SIT appears to be the single source that can satisfy the Flight Plan training requirements and issuance of the ID/IQ contract will reduce procurement lead time and streamline the selection and ordering of course when funds are available.  The SIT classes delivered in the past few years have resulted in a number of employees pursuing advanced engineering degrees and offering the courses has had a positive effect on the systems engineering knowledge base and on employee morale.  The course format and onsite delivery results in the FAA being able to offer this educational benefit to a larger number of employees than would otherwise be possible with the traditional, tuition-remission, one employee, one-class-at-a-time method.  By continuing the training already started with SIT, the FAA will realize labor cost and time savings described earlier, meet the Flight Plan training goals and provide academic continuity for those employees pursuing advanced engineering studies. The required tasks under the proposed contract will include:   Graduate level Systems Engineering course instruction, at FAA provided facilities, to Air Traffic Organization (ATO) employees and managers with a minimum class size of 15 ATO employees;   Systems Engineering courses, similar to those described in Attachment 1, will be taught by full-time professors.  Subjects are in the area of Lifecycle, Architecture, Program Management, System Integrations, System Thinking, Modeling and Simulation, and other System Engineering courses that may be added to the curriculum by SIT during the life of the contract;   The courses shall be in a modular format, where 16 weeks of traditional academic course work is delivered within a 5-day, 40-hour period.   The courses shall be a academic courses for credit and employees who successfully complete an offered course will receive a letter grade (i.e. A,B,C, etc)  and credits (minimum of 3);    For up to eleven weeks after the on-site lecture, the professor shall be available to ATO employees, either in person or via e-mail, internet or telephone, to provide instruction and consultation pertinent to course material and assigned homework projects; and    Within 30 days after the course concludes and all students have been issued grades and credits, the University will deliver a letter to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative that contains the total number of students that signed up for the class, total number of students that received credits for the class, total number of students who either did not finish the class and number of students who failed.   Based on the success that the FAA has experienced with SIT's services, the continuing need to offer systems engineering courses to ATO personnel and the desire to provide continuity in the curriculum and format of classes offered, the FAA believes that SIT is the single source to meet all of the above stated requirements.  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the FAA announces its decision to contract with Stevens Institute of Technology  Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken , New Jersey, 07030 using single source procedures.   A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If you do not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of requisite capabilities and experience in providing systems engineering educational services for the FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and received no later than 2 pm, local time, July 10, 2007.  Responses are to be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration William J. Hughes Technical Center Engineering Services Acquisition Sub-Team (AJP-7951) Attn:  P. Schlegel Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) anticipates issuing a Prospectus soliciting proposals for a concession contract to provide Lodging, Food & Beverage, Retail, and Other Services at Big Bend National Park, Texas.   The Prospectus explains the business opportunity and the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract.  The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R.

The National Park Service will issue the Prospectus on July 3, 2007, under the terms described in the Prospectus, with proposals due no later than 4:00 p.m. on Monday, October 1, 2007.  Any proposal, including those of the existing concessioner, must be received by the Acting Chief of Concessions, Intermountain Region, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228 by the deadline date in order to be evaluated and considered for award of the concession contract.  The Prospectus will also be available at the NPS website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/Prospectus.cfm.  Hard copies will be available upon request for a printing cost recovery charge.  The fee will be $35 per copy to be delivered via Federal Express or $30 per copy if picked up in person.  Persons interested in obtaining a Prospectus should mail or bring in person a check or money order (no cash sales) made payable to the NPS.  You must include a business address (no post office box) and telephone number to receive a Federal Express package.

<ARCHDATE>07012008
<CONTACT>Sandy Poole Chief of Concessions, MWR 4026611748     sandy_poole@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a Prospectus soliciting proposals for a new ten-year concessions contract for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Marina and Other Services within Isle Royale National Park.  The Prospectus explains the business opportunity and the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. A pre-bid site visit has been scheduled during the week of August 27, 2007 in order to allow interested parties an opportunity to see the facilities while they are open.  Attendance at the site visit is not required in order to submit a proposal for the Prospectus, but attendance is encouraged.  No questions specific to the Prospectus will be entertained during the site visit.  However, attendees may submit any questions in writing to the National Park Service for response upon release of the Prospectus.  Transportation to the island requires site visit attendees to schedule transportation on August 28 and return from the island on or after August 30.  Information regarding transportation to and from the island can be found at http://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/transportation-services.htm.   The National Park Service recommends that attendees make arrangements to travel to the island on Tuesday, August 28, 2007 from Houghton, Michigan on the Ranger III, as food and beverage services on the Ranger III are a required service for the next concessions contract. The National Park Service expects to issue the Prospectus prior to the beginning of the 2008 operating season, when transportation to the island and facilities will be inaccessible due to winter weather.  The site visit will begin at 9 a.m. on August 29, 2007 in the Rock Harbor Auditorium and will conclude no later than 5:00 p.m.  During the second day of the site visit, boats will transport site visit attendees to the Windigo area of the island to view those concession facilities.  Following an overview of the business opportunity and an explanation of the bidding process, there will be an opportunity to tour some of the specific facilities.  The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined that the existing concessioner is not a preferred offeror for the contract.  The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 brings more competition into the concessions contracting process.  This will be the first competitive bidding process for this business opportunity.  Facilities included as part of this business opportunity include Rock Harbor Lodge which includes four lodge units, cumulatively containing 60 lodge rooms and 10 duplex cottages (totaling 20 cottage units).  The facilities were all built between the 1920s and 1960s.  The business opportunity also includes dining facilities, snack bar on the island at Rock Harbor and on the Ranger III, retail outlets at Rock Harbor and Windigo, shower and laundry services, vending services, a marina with a variety of services and employee housing.  Average annual gross receipts for the past three years from this operation is approximately $1.1 million dollars.  For additional information and to make reservations to attend the site visit, please call Larry Kangas, Chief Ranger at 906-487-7148 or Sandy Poole, Concessions Program Manager Midwest Region at 402-661-1748 by  5 p.m. EDT Friday, July 27, 2007.  Because of transportation issues and to ensure lodging is available to site visit participants, the park must have your reservation by this date.  Additional information about the park can be viewed at the following web site: http://nps.gov/isro/

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for Phase 2 of the Repair and Renovation project at the U.S. Post Office & Federal Courthouse in Terre Haute, Indiana.  PHASE 1 OF THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED.  The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, with an anticipated project duration of approximately 14 months.  The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises.
  
The project scope consists of demolition of the existing south canopy and dock, mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure, fire protection infrastructure and construction of the U.S. Postal Service space.  The work on the basement and 1st floor--including demolition of the existing south canopy, loading dock, and a portion of the mezzanine level--is needed to allow for construction of the new exterior building shell and mechanical spaces in the mezzanine level.  The construction of a new U.S. Postal Service mailroom, including the installation of a new loading door, is required.  New mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure, inclusive of boilers, chillers and fan room equipment, is to be purchased and set in place.  Minimal connections will take place in this phase.  Connections to air handling unit and electrical connections will be temporarily made to keep the U.S. Post Office in operation throughout construction.  The project also includes bringing fire protection service and risers to the basement and 1st floors only.  The following shall be done as required:  abatement of hazardous material and the installation of technology systems.

The best value trade-off process will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, experience of key personnel and past performance on similar projects.    

Small Business Participation:  In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $31 million.  

Joint Ventures:  Joint ventures or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

Interested Parties/How to Offer:  The solicitation package will only be available electronically.  It will be available on or about July 17, 2007.  The solicitation will not be available on the FedBizOpps website.  The solicitation can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).

<SUBJECT>B -- Testing the Cluster SNP or Molecular Scale Strategy for Replicating Genotype-Phenotype Associations from GWA Scans
<SOLNBR>LPCPSC07-18
<RESPDATE>071607
<ARCHDATE>07312007
<CONTACT>Patricia Meise, Purchasing Agent, Phone 410-558-8043, Fax 410-558-8319, Email meisep@grc.nia.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Johns Hopkins University, Core SNP Center for project entitled ?Testing the Cluster SNP or Molecular Scale Strategy for Replicating Genotype-Phenotype Associations from GWA Scans?.   Previously we performed Genome Wide Association (GWA) scans on over 5,000 Sardinian subjects with complete and valid personality trait information from a well established personality inventory ? the NEO-PI-R.  Because replication is so vital in GWA studies, LPC has presently underway three replication studies.  Two of the three replication studies attempt to determine whether the top 5 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for each of the five factors of the NEO can be replicated in an Dutch (Free University of Amsterdam) and Tecumseh, Michigan (Univ of Michigan, Dept of Statistic Genetics).  The third replication study while adopting the same methodological design as the Dutch and Michigan replication attempts to expand very greatly the number of individual SNPs to be replicated seeking to replicate approximately the top 1500 individual SNPs in the Baltimore ECA sample.  The results of the first two replication studies were not very encouraging.  Our experience and that of the field as a whole indicates that replicating genotype-phenotype associations is very difficult.  But replication is essential for establishing the credibility of a genotype-phenotype association.  Limitations of various kinds ranging from technical to financial limit one?s ability to successfully replicate all significant Sardinia SNP-trait findings.  So as mentioned above, our Dutch and Michigan collaborators attempted to replicate only the top 6 SNPs for each of our 5 phenotypes and a third replication study done on the Baltimore ECA sample will be attempting to replicate the top SNPs for each of the five personality factors and 30 facets.  Recently we have identified an alternative strategy to replicate clusters of SNPs which emerge across different samples rather than individual SNPs.  This alternative strategy we call the Molecular Scale Strategy.  This ?cluster SNP? approach or Molecular Scale Strategy involves genotyping an entirely different set of SNPs.   Our main objective is to test this cluster of SNP replication or Molecular Scale Strategy we have identified about 4-500 hundred SNPs for each of the five factors and this contract will allow for the genotyping of these replicated clusters of SNPs initially identified in the Sardinia sample on the ECA sample.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 c (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Johns Hopkins Univ is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  The Baltimore ECA sample and associated DNA are a tremendously unique and invaluable data set and source.   Only this sample has carefully followed a community sample since 1980 and has collected NEO-PI_R personality information as well as personality disorder, life chart, health, and service use data on a multiracial inner-city sample.  In addition, and most importantly, the Institutional Review Board or IRB requirements (H.33.01.03.26.A2) stipulates and requires the ECA DNA to be reposited at the JHU Core.  Thus the only genotyping facility that is granted access to the DNA and that can perform these genotyping assays is the DNP Core Center.  A survey of the literature in this field shows that there are no other sources for these data.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of  FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

Following review and evaluation of all capabilities statements received from this announcement a list of those deemed best qualified to perform the work will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal and any other logistical considerations.  Based on the review of the capability statements received in response to this announcement, the MMS reserves the right to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the list of those deemed best qualified.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to this announcement and in accordance with FAR 15.202.  The Government anticipates an award of a Time & Materials (T&M) type contract.  The period of performance for this contract shall thirty (30) months from the date of award. BACKGROUND: New physical oceanographic data are becoming available from ongoing and recently completed studies funded by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Gulf of Mexico OCS Region (GOMR), and these data provide new opportunities to investigate circulation processes in the ultra-deep Gulf of Mexico.  Data analyses associated with these studies provide some highlights of physical oceanographic features and processes that occur in the lower layer in deep and ultra-deep water regions of the Gulf of Mexico.  Process modeling studies proposed in this study will complement and extend process information obtained from these data analyses.  Future hindcast studies with high quality process modeling and an improved simulation could provide a comprehensive current field in ultra-deep regions. The MMS GOMR has recently conducted and completed a suite of process modeling studies that have greatly enhanced our understanding of physical oceanographic processes on the slope and rise in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.  Similarly, the benefit of new ultra-deep data to the MMS shall be substantially enhanced and complemented by ultra-deepwater process modeling studies with sufficient detail coverage.  Modeling studies will allow the detailed examination of processes by means of numerical experiments that are difficult or even impossible to accomplish in data analysis studies. PURPOSE AND SCOPE:  The purpose of this project is to 1) Examine circulation processes and energetics from approximately 1,000 meters depth to the seafloor in ultra-deep Gulf of Mexico waters; 2) Examine ultra-deep vertical as well as horizontal transport in the Gulf and the mechanisms and processes which characterize it, and to examine the degree to which lower layer and upper layer circulation interact; and 3) Address the nature of interactions of lower layer circulation with realistic ultra-deep bottom topography, and effects of these interactions, including bottom dissipation and steering, on ultra-deep circulation processes.  This effort encompasses all tasks from initial planning, through and including, MMS's final acceptance of all deliverables. Scheduling of this study is as follows: Study Phase I will be approximately 1 year long and will be devoted primarily to collection, management, and analysis of existing data, as well as model simulation and process studies, and quarterly reporting.  Study Phase II will be devoted primarily to completing analyses and interpretation of model output and process study findings, and the production of the Final Report.  The computational domain should include the Gulf of Mexico from the sea surface to the seafloor; although the main focus of interpretation and discussion will be the circulation processes and energetics found from approximately 1,000 meters depth to the seafloor in ultra-deep Gulf of Mexico waters. Ultra-deep waters are defined as waters deeper than 1524 meters.   SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer specified for receipt.  The capability statement shall not exceed 25 pages (on 8.5 X 11 size paper, single sided print in MS Word, with a font of 10 points or higher), any pages in excess of 25 will not be evaluated.  The capability statement should provide information detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience. The Offeror shall provide information on which tasks each key person shall perform, qualifications for completing those tasks, and the rationale for that assignment; (2) organizational experience pertaining to numerical modeling of circulation processes in the Gulf of Mexico; (3) facilities; and (4) provide three references of similar contracts performed by either your proposed Key Personnel and/or your organization for the last two years.  Include a description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number. If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  EVALUATION OF CAPABILITIY STATEMENT:  Your capability statements will be evaluated based on the following factors which are of equal importance: (1) demonstrated experience and expertise of all key technical personnel, especially as regards to their knowledge and experience in light of specific tasks to be performed; (2)The Project Manager's demonstrated leadership ability and experience with coordination and management of this type of effort, and ability to control costs and to keep project performance and deliverables on schedule; (3) Demonstrated organizational history of successfully conducting projects of similar size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value; producing high-quality deliverables; and completing similar projects on schedule and within budget.  Additionally this factor consists of adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of services delivered, the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties, and the Offeror's business integrity.; (4) Demonstration of adequate facilities to complete the tasks.

Following review and evaluation of all capabilities statements received from this announcement a list of those deemed best qualified to perform the work will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal and any other logistical considerations.  Based on the review of the capability statements received in response to this announcement, the MMS reserves the right to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the list of those deemed best qualified.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to this announcement and in accordance with FAR 15.202.  The Government anticipates an award of a Time & Materials (T&M) type contract.  The period of performance for this contract shall twenty-four (24) months from the date of award. BACKGROUND: The MMS proposes to lease within the NAB in its proposed 2007-2012 5-year program.  The Oil Spill Risk Analysis (OSRA) is a cornerstone foundation for evaluating impacts and alternatives in OCS oil and gas leasing Environmental Impact Statement preparation and for evaluating mitigation, such as oil spill contingency plans.  MMS does not have a functional circulation model for the NAB on which to base the OSRA.  Previous MMS contractors (RAND Corporation and Applied Science Associates) did develop circulation and oil spill trajectory models for the Bering Sea in the late 1970's through the late 1980's, but these models are no longer functional, available to MMS, or state-of-the art.   PURPOSE AND SCOPE:  Adapt and maximize the skill of an existing, coupled ice-ocean circulation model which includes the Bering Sea to represent the physical processes, especially circulation, within the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area [NAB] (southeastern Bering Sea).  Provide MMS with verification of model skills.  Provide MMS with 10-20 years hindcast, gridded 3-hour wind velocity, surface water velocity, ice velocity, ice cover; and limited other modeled fields as agreed on between contractor and MMS.  The MMS will use these results in the oil-spill-trajectory analysis for a potential oil and gas lease sale in the North Aleutian Basin.  In Task 1, the contractor shall hold a post-award conference in Anchorage with MMS staff to insure a clear understanding by all of study tasks, concerns, availability of relevant data and reports, and timelines.  The Contractor shall: provide a draft agenda to participants prior to the meeting, provide Meeting Summary to participants within one week of meeting, and list any changes needed to planned work as a result of the meeting.  For Task 2, the Contractor operates under a project management plan, provides progress reports, and participates in required scientific meetings.  In Task 3, the Contractor modifies an existing model domain, boundaries, and physics as necessary to maximize skill in the area of interest:  the southeastern Bering Sea.  In Task 4, the Contractor conducts sensitivity testing to establish robustness of the model, develop and uses validation procedures to validate model against observed data, and present sensitivity and validation results of the modified model to the MMS Modeling Review Board (MRB).  In Task 5, the Contractor provides the 3-hour gridded velocity fields (wind, surface water, ice), ice cover, and other fields readily available from the model and requested by MMS to and in a format acceptable (at the time of delivery) to MMS OSRA modelers in Herndon, VA.  In Task 6 the Contractor documents results of the study with model manual, final report, technical summary, and submission of a paper to a peer-reviewed journal.   SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer specified for receipt.  The capability statement shall not exceed 25 pages (on 8.5 X 11 size paper, single sided print in MS Word, with a font of 10 points or higher), any pages in excess of 25 will not be evaluated.  The 25 page limit excludes the papers identified below.  The capability statement should provide information detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience. The Offeror shall provide information on which tasks each key person shall perform, qualifications for completing those tasks, and the rationale for that assignment; (2) organizational experience, including an annotated citation list of peer-reviewed and other relevant papers on the model you will be proposing to use or based on the model.  Also include copies of up to three papers from this list; (3) facilities; and (4) provide three references of similar contracts performed by either your proposed Key Personnel and/or your organization for the last two years.  Include a description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number. If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  EVALUATION OF CAPABILITIY STATEMENT:  Your capability statements will be evaluated based on the following factors which are of equal importance: (1) demonstrated experience and expertise of all key technical personnel, especially as regards to their knowledge and experience in light of specific tasks to be performed; (2)The Project Manager's demonstrated leadership ability and experience with coordination and management of this type of effort, and ability to control costs and to keep project performance and deliverables on schedule; (3) Demonstrated organizational history of successfully conducting projects of similar size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value; producing high-quality deliverables; and completing similar projects on schedule and within budget.  Additionally this factor consists of adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of services delivered, the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties, and the Offeror's business integrity.; (4) Demonstration of adequate facilities to complete the tasks.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL) in Montgomery, Alabama intends to issue a sole-source contract for fixed air and radiation monitoring stations with General Atomics Electronic Systems, Inc. (GAESI) of San Diego, California under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. EPA envisions awarding a new contract to satisfy the requirement for up to 140 of the monitoring stations which were part of the Government's original requirement for no more than 180 monitors under Contract EP-W-05-012. The aforementioned contract expired due to an administrative error in exercising option periods.   It has been determined that GAESI is uniquely qualified to continue to satisfy the Government's requirement. 40 monitors have been manufactured, tested, and installed nationwide at considerable start-up and testing costs. Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that was incurred to develop, manufacture, delivery, test, and establish the 40 monitors that is not expected to be recovered through another competition.  In addition, extensive software and hardware modifications have been made to EPA information technology systems to support these monitors.  Due to their unique design and operating software, only GAESI can supply these monitors to ensure the functionality and interoperability across the nationwide monitoring network. The estimated value of this fixed-price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract is $9.5M with a five-year period of performance.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at rodgers.jami@epa.gov by the response date. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

An A cquisition Requirements Package (ARP) is currently in development for a follow-on competitive contract for FBCB2/BFT Global Support Services.  Solicitation Number W15P7T-07-R-J414 is assigned to this action for reference purposes, there are no solicitation  documents.

<DESC>This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program.  The purpose of the MRR program is to support its various customers throughout the Continental United  States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the MRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP), cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF), or time and materials (T&M) task orders may be issued fo r the provision of stand-alone repair/renewal services or a combination of repair/renewal and supplemental A-E services (i.e. Design-Build).  Specifically, task orders may be awarded for work to be performed through-out the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and all US territories, for the following Government agencies: Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and state and local governments.  Prior Government contract experience is not required for receiving an award under the planned solicitation.  Ho wever, all construction performance must be in compliance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1 and must also comply with all Federal, State and local laws, ordinances, codes, and regulations.  Offe rors may propose this requirement as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s), a joint venture, or a teaming arrangement.  Performance and payment bonding is required for all maintenance, repair, renewal, and construction efforts.  Offeror s must be able to perform multiple contracts (task orders) simultaneously in various geographic locations.  Offerors must have the ability to bond the construction efforts at a minimum of $5,000,000 per task and $25,000,000 aggregate.

Offerors must have the capability to perform all work effo rts required under this contract at Government medical facilities in accordance with all applicable medical technical publications, codes, and specifications.  Medical repair and construction experience is required.  The proposed ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total programmatic repair/renewal requirements expected to be awarded under the MRR construction (with design-build capabilities) contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $500,000,000.  The Government will conduct three separate competitions for award of multiple ID/IQ construction (with design-build capabilities) contracts to support this programs repair/renewal requirements (one unrestricted, one rest ricted for competition amongst 8(a) small businesses, and one restricted for competition amongst HUBZone small businesses).  This synopsis publicizes a proposed solicitation (request for proposal) for the unrestricted competition.  The 8(a) restricted comp etition and the HUBZone restricted competition will be publicized and solicited separately under solicitation numbers W912DY-07-R-0030 and W912DY-07-R-0031, respectively.  Of the total $500,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $276,000,000 is estimated for the unrestricted MATOC pool, $112, 000,000 is estimated for the 8(a) MATOC pool, and $112,000,000 is estimated for the HUBZone MATOC pool.  Each MATOC total capacity will be shared amongst all awardees in the MATOC pool.  A more detailed description of the acquisition strategy will be provi ded in the solicitation documents.   The unrestricted solicitation will be made available to interested parties through the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov, after the closing date of this synopsis.

FedBiz Interest Announcement for P3 Tanking

Background: The U.S. Forest Service (FS), is responsible for protecting National Forest lands from wildland fires and, by agreement with other agencies, assists in protecting other jurisdictions. The Forest Service has acquired 3 excess military aircraft for conversion to airtanker configuration. This contract is to provide an acceptable tank system and its installation for these aircraft.

Scope: This contract is for the purchase and installation of a retardant delivery system for up to 3 Forest Service owned P3B (Heavy) and P3C aircraft. Once installation and performance evaluation is complete,these aircraft would be used as large airtankers for wildland firefighting. The capacity of the retardant delivery system will be commensurate with the load carrying capacity of the aircraft. The volume of the
retardant tank shall be a minimum of 2500 gallons. The work includes design, analysis, installation and testing of the aircraft for conversion to wildland firefighting using a retardant tank. The resultant airtanker conversion shall meet the performance requirements of the Interagency Airtanker Board. Conversion of the aircraft shall occur at the contractor?s facility.

Requirements: The retardant delivery system shall be of new manufacture, externally mounted and a gravity flow design. The retardant delivery system performance shall meet the Interagency Airtanker Board tank system criteria which can be viewed at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/airtankers/iab_procedures/iab_procedures_sec_vii_tank_system.pdf.  The Tank installation shall be approved for use on the P3B (Heavy) and P3C airframe by the Federal Aviation Administration by Supplemental Type Certificate. The tank system shall have serviceable/maintainable life of no less than twenty (20) years.

Tank Installation: The installation of the retardant delivery system will not interfere with or cause disablement of the aircraft environmental systems to include the pressurization of the fuselage. The basic structure of the aircraft shall not be modified to the extent that it cannot be readily returned to its original configuration following removal of the tank and the bomb bay shall remain intact and operational. The installation of the
tank/retardant delivery system shall not alter the speed restrictions of an OEM, as delivered, non modified aircraft by more than ten (10) percent.

Tank Capacity:The capacity of the retardant delivery system shall remain within the Manufacturer or FAA approved normal weight limitations and center of gravity configuration for the aircraft. The approximate volume of the retardant tank should be 2500 to 3000 gallons based on a retardant weight of 9 lbs. per gallon. The
offerors specified tank quantity shall be supported by weight and balance criteria and airframe structural loads engineering analysis.

DESCRIPTION
(Note: This BAA Addendum 5 is submitted as a Special Focus Area, as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

The Defense Sciences Office seeks innovative proposals to develop the science and technology necessary to enable in-theatre production of red blood cells (RBCs) from a progenitor cell source thus replacing the current system of donor blood. The vision for the Blood Pharming Program is to develop novel technologies to enable in vitro production of red blood cells that are untainted, readily available, and free of storage lesions. The ultimate goal of the program is the development of an automated, fieldable cell culture and packaging system capable of producing transfusable amounts of universal donor (Type O negative) RBCs using human progenitor cells as starting material. RBCs produced by the system must be shown to be the functional equivalent of donor-derived RBCs and induce no greater responses than normal donor derived RBCs. Submissions must provide evidence of a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary team led by a Systems Integrator (SI) capable of fulfilling the vision, objectives and milestones of the program as detailed herein. The final product will be an automated culture system that 1) maintains a self-renewing progenitor cell population, 2) supports the differentiation, separation and packaging of transfusable RBCs, and 3) is ready for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all applicable device and transfusable cell product approvals. This effort will be conducted over a 36-month period in three phases. Proposers are requested to submit a proposal focused on addressing the Phase 1 milestone and metrics and describe how the approach will transition to the subsequent phases.

BACKGROUND
Transfusion therapy has been an integral part of military medicine since the middle of the last century. As the O2-carrying component of blood, RBCs are the most transfused blood product in battlefield trauma care. Unfortunately, it is likely that fresh RBCs are either unavailable or limited in supply in a battlefield environment due to the inherent liabilities of the donor system (e.g., recruitment challenges, increasing deferment criteria) coupled with the global nature of U.S. military operations. In addition, well-documented changes occur to RBCs during ex vivo storage that affect normal function and may be detrimental to the recipient. In the seriously injured warfighter, such ?storage-induced lesions? may compound the physiologically stressful effects of trauma by induction of inflammatory and/or immunologic responses.

The purpose of the Blood Pharming Program is to overcome these problems by creating an automated culture and packaging system that will yield a donorless supply of universal donor RBCs from progenitor cell sources in theater. In order to achieve the program goals, several significant technical challenges in the fields of cell biology, bioreactor capability, and design must be overcome. For example, it has been shown that mature, functional RBCs can be derived from a number of different progenitor cell types including those derived from bone marrow, cord blood, apheresed blood, etc. However, large-scale production of transfusable RBCs has not been achieved regardless of the progenitor cell source to date. In addition, it is imperative that RBCs produced by the progenitor-based system be functionally equivalent to fresh donor cells especially with regard to O2-carrying capacity and morphology. Separately, an automated cell culture system capable of a) maintaining a self-renewing progenitor population, b) providing a milieu for efficient differentiation along the erythroid pathway, c) sorting/purifying end-product RBCs, and d) packaging RBCs in a ?ready for transfusion? manner does not exist. It is envisioned that the automated culture/packaging system will be placed in military medical treatment facilities, and therefore must operate under field conditions and with minimal user intervention. To achieve these goals, revolutionary advances in research areas such as control of progenitor cell expansion/differentiation and development of automated bioreactor systems that are capable of automated cell manipulation and cell purification will be necessary.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES
The Blood Pharming Program is a 36-month thrust to deliver a fully integrated RBC production system and the protocols enabling large-scale production of transfusable RBCs. The program is comprehensive and will deliver a system that is sufficiently mature to enter the appropriate FDA approval processes for general medical use.

This will be an extremely aggressive, milestone-driven program. Consequently, it is necessary that progress be assessed regularly throughout the program via scheduled milestones and metrics associated with the performance of critical components. This program will be divided into three major phases (9-month Phase I, 18-month Phase II and a 9-month Phase III).

It is understood that research in many areas will be required in order to reach the ultimate goal. These research areas will include, but are not limited to: progenitor cell biology and erythroid differentiation; RBC physiology; cellular support matrices/scaffolds; automated cell culture systems; and cell sorting, purification and packaging. Achievement of program milestones/metrics will demand prompt identification of areas requiring further research and rapid application of advancements made in these areas. Proposers must detail the critical steps for progenitor cell maintenance and erythroid differentiation, as well as the components necessary to construct an automated RBC production and packaging system and address how their collective team will achieve those challenges. 

Successful Phase I teams will demonstrate production of 10 Units of universal donor RBCs per week for 4 weeks in an automated culture system using a non-self-renewing (replaceable) progenitor cell population. For the realization of this milestone, research efforts should:
1)	Demonstrate at least 2x106-fold expansion from progenitor source to mature RBCs, 
2)	Identify at least 3 stage-specific cell properties (size, shape, biomarker expression) that support automated culture, and
3)	Demonstrate normal RBC properties and function including, but not limited to: 
Blood Type: O negative
Morphologic Characteristics: Size 7-8 micrometers, Biconcave Disc, Loss of organelles 
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration: 32 to 36 g/dl
Mean Corpuscular Volume: 80 - 100 fL
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin: 29 - 31 pg/cell
Loss of Progenitor Markers: CD34, c-kit, Sca-1, CD133, CD38, CD71 (specific markers for the chosen progenitor cell source should be provided)
Expression of RBC Markers: Lin, LDS staining
Deformability: DI max 0.41 to 0.53
Enzymatic Activity: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 8.6-18.6 IU/g hemoglobin, Pyruvate Kinase (PK) 2.0-8.8 IU/g hemoglobin
Oxygen equilibrium measurements; Kinetics of CO2 Rebinding: log(P50) value 1.3, N50 2.29; Two phases corresponding to R and T states
Inflammatory/Immunogenic Markers: Pyrogen- and pathogen-free; in vitro absence of immuno-inflammatory response (e.g., mixed lymphocyte culture assay)  

Successful Phase II teams will demonstrate production of 100 Units of universal donor RBCs per week for 8 weeks in an automated culture system using a self-renewing (not replaceable) progenitor population. For the realization of this milestone, research efforts must:
1)	Maintain Phase I cellular product, 
2)	Demonstrate at least 2x108-fold expansion of progenitor population to mature RBCs, and
3)	Prepare and submit all applicable FDA documentation for the cell production system and for a transfusable blood product.

Successful Phase III teams will develop a fieldable, RBC production system less than or equal to a 47 ft3 total dimension. For the realization of this milestone, research efforts must:
1)	Maintain Phase 2 metrics, and
2)	Have a production system that meets current military specifications for use in an in-theater medical treatment facility including the ability to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity, dust, frequent transport, and electrical transients.

TEAM ORGANIZATION
The goals of the Blood Pharming Program demand that a central element of the successful proposal will be a multi-disciplinary team with demonstrated capability. Involved fields of expertise should include progenitor cell biologists, cell culture experts, bioreactor engineers, cell separation scientists, clinicians, and experience with product commercialization and with the FDA regulatory environment. Proposals that center solely on one research area, while neglecting the overall vision, will not be considered for funding. 

It is critical that the research team be built from its inception around a Systems Integrator (SI). The SI will be responsible for the overall team direction, organization, and accomplishment of all milestones and the delivery of the final product, including the FDA approval application. Consequently, the SI must have a proven record of success in integration efforts of similar complexity, as well as a commitment to shepherd the program to commercial transition. The SI must demonstrate complete understanding and sharing of the DARPA vision of an automated production system to create a donorless source of universal donor RBCs that is ultimately fieldable; the SI that is strictly in the effort for project management will not be successful. As the team leader held accountable for timely delivery of the proposed work, the SI must have the authority to develop and maintain the proper team membership to ensure accomplishment of the task. During the course of performance, it is expected that some team members may be more active than others and that some team members may need to be replaced.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
A two-stage source selection is anticipated. It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that a white paper be submitted prior to full proposal submission, according to the guidelines provided below.

White Paper and Full Proposal Deadlines

Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor?s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.
The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is responsible for the management and operation of thirteen Air Force Bases located in several southern states.  Three of AETC?s bases are located in the electrically deregulated part of Texas: Sheppard AFB near Wichita Falls, TX, Goodfellow AFB near San Angelo, TX, and Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, TX.  These bases have an aggregated energy requirement of approximately 225,000 Megawatt Hours per year and a peak demand of approximately 45 Megawatts.  For these bases, AETC is interested in developing an aggregated electric supply solution.  AETC is considering the use of a special purpose Retail Electric Provider (REP).  AETC believes that a special purpose REP will create opportunities for AETC to more economically manage its forward supply needs utilizing a portfolio purchasing method that will allow further opportunities for AETC to purchase a mix of generation types (traditional and renewable fuels), while lending flexibility for the purchase of unique renewable resources (i.e., solar, landfill gas, wind, municipal solid waste).  Purchases of renewable energy resources are required under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  To achieve these objectives AETC wishes to identify an Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market participant that is a registered Retail Electric Provider.
As part of Market Research, this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there is more than one Retail Energy Provider (REP) capable of providing the services described above.  Also, based on the responses to this RFI a determination of suitability for small business set aside will be made.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 221122 with a maximum size standard for small business designation of 4 million megawatt hours per year.  Once Market Research has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors? to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors? must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR) and must be qualified to perform in the correct NAICS code as aforementioned.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors? shall indicate their size standard (large business, small business, 8a, HUBZone, SDB/8(a), SD-VOSB, VOSB, WOSB, etc.) when replying to this RFI.  Provide a single point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code, and your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  
In your response briefly describe your company, years of experience in the Texas market as an REP, number of employees, and the physical locations of (i) your main offices, (ii) your REP operations, (iii) your QSE operations, and (iv) your back office services.  
Please provide answers for each of the following, utilizing the existing numbering scheme for each response, and limiting your total response for this RFI to no more than fifteen (15) pages:

<DESC>(1) The purpose of this modification is to correct the description of the MedSun program as addressed in the synopsis (Modification No. 2). As a result, the first paragraph of the Description section is hereby deleted and replaced with the following version:

The Food and Drug Administration intends to make a single award for professional services to support the MedSun program. MedSun is a medical device adverse event reporting network. It is comprised of a primary network and several sub-networks. The primary network collects information on medical devices generally, while the sub-networks collect information about specific types of devices and tissues and cells. The program involves investigation of the adverse events reported and providing feedback to the clinical community about the events and possible remedies thereto.     Currently 350 hospitals participate in the MedSun program, providing reports to both the primary network and sub-networks.

(2) The proposal due date remains unchanged as a result of this modification.

Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.  8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.   Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.   EVALUATION. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations: 1) lowest price technically acceptable 2) time of delivery Quotations are due by COB- 1600 (4:00PM) PST on July 11, 2007 at The Purchasing & Contracting Branch, Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC)/Marine Corps Air Ground Task Force Training Command (MCAGTFTC), P.O.

<SUBJECT>A--Modification of Due Date for receipt of information for Navy Shipboard Plastic Waste Recycling under Sources Sought N00167-07-SS-105 originally issued on 30 May 07
<SOLNBR>N0016707SS105
<RESPDATE>073107
<CONTACT>Ms. Tracy M. Carole 301-227-4893
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) are seeking information from potential sources that can provide commercially-viable technologies, systems, or processes for the recycling of shipboard plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversions systems. The Plastics Waste Processor (PWP) is used by the fleet to compact shipboard plastic waste into dense sanitary disks that can be stored in odor barrier bags to prevent shipboard habitability problems. Navy ships retain the plastic waste disks onboard while at sea to comply with zero-plastic waste discharge regulations. When ships return to U.S. ports, these disks are offloaded and disposed of in landfills. Navy ships generate an estimated 1,500 tons per year of plastic waste. The goal of this initiative is to eliminate the landfill disposal of PWP plastic disks through recycling. The potential !  obstacle to recycling is that the plastic disks intermingle various plastic types with food and other contaminants (e.g., metal, glass, paper, cardboard, and cloth) by melting the thermoplastics around the other constituents. The proposed solution must demonstrate the ability to recycle the plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversion systems at a cost equal to or lower than current landfill disposal fees ($40-$50 per ton). The proposed solution shall also identify who will remove the plastic disks offloaded from Navy ships. Potential offerors are requested to respond with technical documentation supporting the commercially-viable technology, system or process, including: (a) process description, (b) processing rate capability, (c) descriptions of demonstrations conducted to date, (d) current commercial, industrial, or military applications, (e) an estimate of the fee (per ton plastic waste) to process the PWP plastic di!  sks, (f) preliminary implementation plan (less than one page), that tr acks the Navy plastic disks from who removes the disks offloaded from Navy ships all the way to how the disks are used or consumed in the final application, and (g) quantity of systems sold or in use commercially. Technical, industry, or professional society certifications or endorsements should be provided, if available. The submittals should consist of no more than ten pages of text, including data and/or illustrations and are due by July 31, 2007. This synopsis is for information purposes and to identify potential technologies and offerors. This sources sought announcement does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP) and does not obligate the government in any way to purchase or test any of the potential solutions offered. Furthermore, it does not commit the government to pay for any proposal costs in response to the sources sought announcement. Submit responses for this synopsis to Ms. Tracy M. Carole by email (tracy.carole@navy.mil) or by mail to Naval Surface Warfa!  re Center, Attn: Tracy M. Carole, Code 634, 9500 MacArthur Blvd., West Bethesda, Maryland 20817-5700.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative is a collaborative effort to harness the power of information technologies to modernize structured learning.  It sets forth a new paradigm to provide access to the highest quality education and training that can be tailored to individual needs and delivered cost-effectively, whenever and wherever it is required.  The ADL Initiative employs a structured, adaptive, collaborative effort between the public and private sectors to develop the standards, tools, and learning content for the future-learning environment.

The ADL Initiative created a network of four ADL Co-Laboratories (ADL Co-Labs) to advance the initiative and to serve distinct areas of operational responsibility.  The ADL Co-Lab Network serves as the focal point and catalyst for the large-scale cooperative research, development, implementation and assessment of ADL technologies and related products.  As a member of that ADL Co-Lab Network, the Joint ADL Co-Lab integrates instruction and technology to meet the military’s training requirements.  It actively pursues research interests to advance the state of distributed learning within the Department of Defense.

PROGRAM SCOPE
The Joint ADL Co-Lab (JADL) anticipates making multiple awards with the dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 for each award.  Offerors may propose on one or more research areas and offerors are encouraged to aggregate two or more research areas in one white paper solution.  Contractors may also Team to propose on research focus areas. The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper must address at least one of the research areas listed in the BAA and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  See attached Enclosure.

PHASE I
Phase I will be a 12-month effort (we will accept some deviation from the 12-month requirement with appropriate justification) and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  The effort will culminate in an initial capabilities demonstration in the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2008.

PHASE II
Phase II will be a 12-month effort (we will accept some deviation from the 12-month requirement with appropriate justification) and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  Final capabilities demonstration will be at the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2009.  Phase II funding is at the discretion of the JADL.

Each white paper must include a statement that the offeror agrees to:

a)	The formal exchange of technical information developed under this effort with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and/or Associated Contract Agreements (ASA),
b)	Participation in at least two mandatory technical interchange meetings with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, and 
c)	Government purpose rights applying to both technical data and software developed under this effort

For projects using the Microsoft .NET framework, the Open Platform for E-Learning (OPEL) is being developed by the Joint ADL Co-Lab for use by the distance learning community and is available to prototype program participants.  The platform is intended to allow prototypes to focus the maximum amount of available funding on value-added research by avoiding the need to develop basic SCORM input/output mechanisms and a graphical user interface for demonstrations.  The platform provides:

    * A SCORM Document Object Model (DOM) that allows for object-oriented reading, writing, and modification of SCORM-conformant files.

    * The “ADL Prototype Program Workbench”, a user-friendly Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides:
            * A graphical user interface (GUI) for working with the SCORM DOM.
            * Reusable design surfaces for displaying and editing common data types (text, XML, charts/graphics, workflow, etc.)
            * Integrated diagnostics capabilities (logging, error reporting, etc.)

    * Code integrated from past prototypes serving a variety of functions.

Prototypes may provide workbench plug-ins, DOM extensions, or entirely new libraries as a means to demonstrate prototype functionality.  If your organization is interested in using OPEL, please contact the Joint ADL Co-Lab for further information. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION
Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper.  White paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received by the Joint ADL Co-Lab no later than 1500 EST on 25 September 2006.  No extensions will be granted.  White papers must address requirements for both phases and shall not exceed 5 pages in length of computerized text at 12 pitch, excluding resumes and diagrams.  Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed by the JADL Evaluation Team to best meet the program objectives.  

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA
White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:

1.	Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to one or more BAA topics.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.  Also, innovative teaming arrangements should be taken into consideration.  Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  

2.	Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of one or more BAA topics.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential alternative approaches and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving Distributed Learning should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered.  

3.	Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offeror’s history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.

4.	Personnel: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for this effort.

5.	Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.
  
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted.  The Government intends to use non-government personnel to assist in the evaluation of white papers/proposals.  Contract personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contract personnel are required to sign Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure Statements.  Offerors will be notified whether or not the white paper was favorably received.  Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the government to fund the effort in whole or in part.  Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter with complete instructions for proposal preparation and submission.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  

This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding.  The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission.  Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government’s solicitation for this effort.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  

WHITE PAPER FORMAT:  White papers shall not exceed 5 pages of computerized text at 12 pitch (excluding cost estimates and diagrams).  Contractor format is acceptable; however, a preferred format is provided as an Enclosure to the BAA. The white papers should be provided in both hardcopy and electronic form no later than 1500 EST 25 September 2006.  NOTE: Both, the hardcopy and the electronic copy MUST BE received together, by the due date/time.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division. Forward deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) have documented requirements for a small, light weight hand-held imager which provides SOF operators the ability to conduct surveillance, detect, identify and track threats in all light, weather conditions, penetrate natural and man-made obscurants such as foliage, dust, smoke, and fog.   This sources sought is for the Medium Range – HHI (HHI-MR) module. This sensor module will provide medium-range surveillance, identification, and detection capabilities in all light and weather conditions and should include an integrated near-IR laser pointer for target designation.   The HHI-MR module will be hand-held device with a maximum weight of 5.0 lbs. The dimensions of the device should be less than 248 cubic inches, (13.8"L x 5"H x 3.6"W). The sensor module shall be constructed of, or coated with, neutral colored non-reflective materials to reduce probability of adversary detection. Sensor shall be responsive enough and have sufficient FOV to detect and classify, at a minimum, a man at 1300m. The focus system shall include one or more manually set fixed focus positions to support rapid transitions from close handiwork to infinity, and any distance in between. The imagers shall utilize software to mitigate the effects of thermal washout. The startup time of a device that uses uncooled thermal sensors shall be less than 5 seconds after power has turned on and for a cooled device shall take less than 5 minutes to power up. Sensors and sensor modules shall be hardened to reduce the probability of electro-magnetic interference with or from platform w!  eapons, communications and power train. Sensors shall be filtered to reduce susceptibility to electro-magnetic environmental effects and optical augmentation without degrading sensor performance. System must support capture of still / live imagery and be capable of feeding data in analog and digital format to external display or recording devices. Sensors shall not emit detectable light or noise to anyone other than the user. System must be powered by the device's battery and operate for a minimum of 5 continuous hours. System shall function in temperatures ranging from -20° C to +60° C (-4° F to +140° F) and in environments where relative humidity ranges from 0-100%. System shall be sealed to ensure it functions reliably in all environments where water, fine dust, sand and other particulate matter both in air, and in solution, are prevalent.  This sources sought is being issued to identify potential sources to manufacture the Medium Range - Hand Held Imager. The Government is interested in utilizing the best available existing technologies or a combination thereof (i.e. non-developmental items, commercial-off-the shelf or modified commercial-off-the-shelf).

<CONTACT>Pamela J Taylor, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-824-1068, Fax 757-824-1974, Email Pamela.J.Taylor@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for services in support of NASA's Sounding Rockets Program (NSRP).  The proposed contract will serve as the principal mechanism for implementation of the NSRP and the NSROC Contractor shall manage and be responsible for providing all associate services and supplies (except those provided as Government Furnished Property).  As such, the Contractor shall design, fabricate, integrate, and perform flight qualification testing of sub-orbital payloads, provide launch vehicles and associated hardware, and provide various activities associated with subsequent mission launch operations.  The Contractor shall have the capability to provide the full spectrum of engineering design and analysis activities necessary for the development of sub-orbital vehicles, payloads, and ground support equipment including (but not limited to) the following disciplines: flight performance and dynamics; structural and mechanical; electrical power; telemetry communication; guidance, navigation, and control; software and information systems; and environmental testing.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities associated with implementation of the NSRP including technical laboratories, fabrication, environmental testing, and explosives storage.  NASA will retain overall management of the NSRP including certain programmatic elements such as mission selection, funding, international agreements, grants administration, oversight and approval of ground and flight safety processes, and ownership of program assets.   The NSROC Contractor shall also be responsible for providing general support under individual task orders that may not be directly related to implementation of the NSRP.  This support shall include, but not be limited to: fabrication of mechanical, structural, electrical, and electronic hardware; environmental testing of flight and ground support hardware and systems; and a broad range of technical activities such as engineering studies, system and subsystem development, drafting and technician services, environmental studies, and education and public outreach services.   In order to encourage the most efficient and best use of the Wallops Flight Facility suborbital program infrastructure, and to reduce the overall cost to NASA for maintaining this infrastructure, the NSROC will enable the Contractor to utilize Wallops Flight Facility resources and capabilities (in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations) for non-NSRP government and commercial customers.	All such efforts shall be performed on a non-interference basis with all NASA assigned work. GSFC is seeking capabilities from all potential sources for the purpose of determining the appropriate level of competition.	 This is not a solicitation announcement.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This sources sought synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  You are requested to provide electronic responses (30-page maximum including attachments) via e-mail to the primary Point of Contact (POC) for this requirement.  Your response is required by August 1, 2007.  To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one-page summary shall be included with your capability statement(s), which identifies your company’s specific capabilities that are relevant to the requirement.  Specific examples of suborbital payload and launch vehicle development activities, launch operations services, and associated examples of the relevant engineering experience (including detailed descriptions) are recommended.  Companies are also requested to provide their name, address, primary POC and telephone number, company’s average annual revenues for the past three years, total number of employees, and your Government size standard/type classification (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran, HUBZone, business, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities) on the summary page.  The summary page will not count against the maximum page limit.  It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.  GSFC/WFF is also interested in potential contractor feedback related to subcontracting opportunities for the various work requirements, given the possibility that the total requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.  This feedback would be used as research information to support the analysis and development of subcontracting goals.	This feedback should also be provided electronically via e-mail to the primary POC by August 1, 2007.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Technical questions should be directed to: emmett.d.ransone@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Pamela.J.Taylor@nasa.gov. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.

About 15% of current users of VISN 12 medical services receive mental health (MH) and substance abuse care.  All estimates suggest that at least twice that many could benefit from care for such conditions.  However, many do not seek care for MH problems due to stigma, inconvenience, and other barriers.  Previous studies in VISN 12 suggest that at least twice as many older veterans would use MH and addiction services if those services were provided in primary care and it is estimated even more would use telephone-delivered services.  The contractor would provide 24 hours per day, seven days a week service for 36 months.  The contractor will make telephonic contact with the OEF/OIF veterans and introduce the program of services that are available and encourage enrollment.  All enrollees will then be contacted by the contractor's experienced behavioral health clinicians for screening and assessment in the areas of PTSD, anxiety disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, etc.  If additional chronic medical conditions are identified, the veteran will be enrolled in a program where the primary care practitioner will handle MH problems.  Having this available to pts and staff telephonically will obviate the need for the alternative, expensive collocation model of integrated care.  Mission statement: The seamless transition of OIF/OEF veterans into VA care and the integration of mental health into primary care are major components of VA's mental health strategic plan and VHA's overall plan for health care. The VA's expectation is for 5,000 veterans to be enrolled for MH services by 9/30/07.

<DESC>The US Army, PM Radars is seeking sources to develop a lightweight, man-portable weapon location sensor that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and enables accurate detection of mortar, rocket and artillery locations.  This systems performa nce is detailed in the Performance Specification For the LIGHTWEIGHT COUNTER MORTAR RADAR (LCMR), AN/TPQ-48 (V)3 dated 8 January 2007, and the SOCOM Operational Requirements Document (adopted by the Army and approved by TRADOC) Annex A, dated May 2005, pro vided herewith. These documents can be viewed via the Interactive Business Opportunities Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil by referencing this solicitation number and/or subject title. Anyone interested shall forward their company name, address, CAGE code, and point of contact information (to include name, title, telephone number and e-mail address) to Joseph Manganaro at joseph.manganaro@conus.army.mil or telephonically at 732-427-1389.  Company information will be verified via the Central Contractor Registration (CC R) database.  If youre registered in this database, access to these documents will be granted.  The Government possesses no technical data package for the LCMR, AN/TPQ-48(V)2 radar and the LCMR AN/TPQ-48(V)3 radar is not required necessarily to be a spira l/evolutionary development from the AN/TPQ-48(V)2 radar design, but rather it must be a radar designed to meet the Performance Specification For the LIGHTWEIGHT COUNTER MORTAR RADAR (LCMR), AN/TPQ-48 (V)3 dated 8 January 2007, and the SOCOM Operational Req uirements Document (adopted by the Army and approved by TRADOC) Annex A, dated May 2005. The Government anticipates a cost reimbursement contract (Not-To-Exceed $30M) to acquire a twelve (12) month developmental effort to deliver thirteen (13) LCMR AN/TPQ-48(V)3 prototype systems capable of passing the multitude of tests required in Developmen tal Testing/Operational Testing (DT/OT).  At the conclusion of prototype development, the Contractor shall support PM Radars and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) in a three (3) month AN/TPQ-48(V)3 testing effort to validate the performance of th ose systems through DT and OT.  At the conclusion of the test and evaluation phase, all exit criteria shall be satisfied.  The anticipated contract shall also include a Time and Materials (T&M) line item for contractor support during OT and will include a requirement for a Level III Technical Data Package to enable full and open competition for the AN/TPQ-48(V)3 production quantities.   All interested contractors must possess a Secret facility clearance with Secret safeguarding capability.  Access to Secret and For Official Use Only (FOUO) information may occur during the course of this contract.   DESCRIPTION:  The Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a lightweight, man-portable weapon location sensor system which, when properly sited, provides continuous 360-degree surveillance using an electronically scanned antenna.  The current LCMR provides the ability  to automatically detect and locate mortar, rocket and artillery firing positions.  Currently fielded AN/TPQ-48(V)1 and AN/TPQ-48(V)2 versions of the LCMR are providing counterfire support in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The LCMR, AN/TPQ-48(V)3 system shall fulfill a current capability gap of existi ng counter fire radars and improve the capability of the previous LCMR systems.  It shall be a mortar, artillery, and rocket locating radar that is lightweight, physically small in size and electronic signature, with 360-degree search capability.  The LCMR  system will have increased accuracy and range, be highly mobile, interoperable, have built in reliability, and be a ruggedized battlefield radar system with high throughput.  The system shall be interoperable with Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Sy stems (AFATDS), Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and future Command and Control (C2) systems, and ha ve a day/night capability for supporting Warfighters in all operational environments including Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT).  The system shall be modular in design, man-portable, and capable of being assembled, disassembled, and transported by a two soldier crew in virtually any position to support any operation.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-48(V)3 shall be designed to be High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mountable as well as deployable in a stand alone, man-portable configuration.   The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) established for the AN/TPQ-48(V)3 system include improved range and accuracy performance requirements, net-ready communications (interoperability), 360-degree coverage, and reliability.  The Government plans to incorporate requirements for associated efforts such as production acceptance qualification, evolution of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and documentation (to include a Level III Technical Data Package), initial spares, and train ing. The Government GFE requirements include: one M1152 HMMWV (with armor kits), Ultra Lightweight Camouflage Net Systems (ULCANS), Single Channel Ground to Air Radio Systems (SINCGARS), Tactical Communications (TAC) Links, Engineering Design Models (EDM), Miss ion-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) gear and associated basic issue items (BII) which will be required for AN/TPQ-48(V)3 development and test.   The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or in any subsequent exchange of information.  All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked.

Telephone Number: 703-682-3660 Systems Background GFEBS will address long-term Army and Department of Defense (DoD) goals and satisfy legislative requirements imposed by the Chief Financial Officers Act. The vision/objective is to implement a CFO Act-compliant general fund finance and accounting capabilit y that supports DoD with accurate, reliable, and timely financial information, in peacetime and in war. GFEBS will serve as the Army's financial backbone, capturing general ledger data into a single system. It will be the system of record for the entire Ar my. Accenture was selected as the GFEBS System Integrator (SI) to replace the Armys legacy financial systems with SAP, a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application.   GCSS- Army (F/T) will enable the Army to integrate the tactical supply chain, obtain accurate equipment readiness, support split base operations, and obtain up-to-date status on maintenance actions and supplies in support of the warfighter. It is the prima ry tactical logistics enabler and combat multiplier to achieve the Army Campaign Plan and Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) Transformation Vision for the Logistics Domain in support of soldiers in the field. The GCSS-Army (F/T) will reengineer the current tactical Standard Army Management Informat ion Systems (STAMIS) and rollout will allow more than 135,000 soldier and contractor users in the total Army to view complete logistics management information and make timely, data-driven decisions. GCSS-Army (F/T) will provide the U.S. Army with accurate logistics management information for effective execution of supply, maintenance, and property accountability operations and timely data sharing with other Army and DoD automation systems. The software technology solution is based on a SAP application that is broken down into segments. Northrop Grumman Mission Systems was awarded a contract for Segment 1.

<SUBJECT>R--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Purchase Order for Oracle Forms Conversion
<DESC>The US Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to award a sole source contract for the following tasks in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is being issued as a commercial acquisition under FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12. The work includes upgrading MMS' TIMS Oracle Forms from 6i to 10g using the PITSS.con licensed software.  This includes 5 day on-site conversion of MMS TIMS Oracle forms and reports and training using the conversion tool, as well as the related impact analysis tools and version control tools.  The PITSS.con software is required to ensure the highest percentage of forms are converted and an impact analysis is performed.  PITSS.con is the only application that offers the impact analysis tool.  The impact analysis tool is required because it will significantly reduce MMS resources maintaining the converted applications.  If the impact analysis tool is not used then the developer must manually go through the entire application to determine the impact a change has on the system.  With the number of forms and reports that are contained in TIMS (~1200), this would be very time consuming and costly.     The Ross Group is the only Oracle forms partner that provides the PITSS.con software and no other U.S. company provides it.   This award period will be for six months beginning in August, 2007.   This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone request will not be honored.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received by the POC listed below by close of business July 18, 2007, will be considered by the government.  POC: Caroline Laikin, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2100, Herndon, VA 20170.  Questions and/or responses must be emailed to Caroline.Laikin@mms.gov or faxed to Caroline Laikin at 703-787-1828.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<SUBJECT>A -- RAPID EYE PROGRAM INDUSTRY DAY
<DESC>The Rapid Eye program is an exploratory development program with the overall goal of developing and demonstrating the ability to deliver a persistent ISR capability anywhere on the globe within one hour and remain on-station until relieved or the mission is completed.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, develop and demonstrate all the technologies necessary for the rocket delivery of a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAV.  These technologies may include: low ballistic coefficient aerodynamic decelerators; low stored volume, deployable UAV structures; and high efficiency propulsion systems for vehicles operating at high altitudes.  Other advanced technologies may also be developed and demonstrated as required by the architectures proposed by Offerors.  The Government is not interested in approachs that employs any form of buoyant flight for this application. 

The Rapid Eye program will research and develop technologies and systems which will enable the military to: (i) rocket deliver a HALE UAV on a ballistic track to the approximate area of interest (ii) decelerate the launch package from reentry speeds to the UAV deployment speed, (iii) deploy the UAV and start its propulsion system, and (iv) provide persistent ISR on-station at high altitudes for a minimum of seven hours.  The air vehicle ISR payload is nominally 500 lbs with a 5kW power requirement.  It is envisioned that this proposed system will utilize a current inventory launch vehicle or one planned to be in the inventory by the end of 2009.  Launch vehicle should not require significant modifications (minor modifications, common to other launches, such as changes to fairing configuration, are permissible).

The key system development objectives include: (i) identification of robust system architectures that meet the program goals at a reasonable cost, (ii) identification of system designs that prove feasibility of the program vision through experimental demonstration and analysis, and (iii) identification and reduction of system and subsystem technology risks.

It is anticipated that the program will be divided into four phases: Phase 1) concurrent, high risk technology evaluation and conceptual system definition studies, concluding with a System Requirements Review and the accompanying Conceptual Design Review; Phase 2) risk reduction and mitigation test phase to include scaled demonstrations of critical subsystems and a Preliminary Design Review of the system; Phase 3) Critical Design Review of the system; Phase 4)  fabrication, assembly, systems integration, and flight test evaluation of the complete demonstration system.

The Rapid Eye program Industry Day will be held on July 25, 2007.  The goals of this meeting are threefold: (i) to familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in the Rapid Eye concept and component technologies, (ii) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of the BAA proposal requirements, and (iii) to promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  It is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive, quality responses to any potential DARPA solicitation.

The Industry Day will be held at Booz Allen Hamilton - Virginia Square, Suite 600
3811 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203-1707 (http://www.boozallen.com).  

Pre-registration is required NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM EDT on July 18, 2007 for attendance.  The Industry Day will be unclassified and is limited to three representatives per organization. Attendance is not required to propose to any potential solicitation on this topic.   Check-in for the Industry Day begins at 8:00 AM, followed by the morning session beginning at 8:30 AM.  This session will include the introduction of the DARPA Rapid Eye program vision and philosophy, objectives and goals, and invited presentations addressing state-of-the-art foundation technologies.  The afternoon session will cover acquisition and program schedules, and contract vehicle details.

<SUBJECT>--Sources Sought - Steel Cast Armor Plate: P900 Plate Qualification (RSCH-2007-04)
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a r equest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informat ion requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. PROGRAM GOAL: 1.  The US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center TARDEC (Warren MI), and the US Army Research Laboratory ARL (Aberdeen Proving rounds MD) are seeking to establish additional sources for a new category of steel alloy, cast, armor  plate; and to establish a Qualified Manufacturers List (QML), for current and future procurements. The government proposes to Identify, test, and qualify companies that have a production capability to meet the requirements. Manufacturers are asked to cont act Mr. Tom Furmaniak via email at tom.furmaniak@us.army.mil for an opportunity to test their plates for qualification. Future acquisition awards will be made only for such products that have been tested and approved for inclusion in the QML.    2. The anticipated date that the Government will begin awarding contracts is under discussion and subject to the results of the qualification testing, contractor lead times, and final determination of plate demand. 3. The procurement strategy for this cast plate will follow the same strategy which the Army has long used for Cast Armor (MIL A 11356).  The Army specifies a chemistry range. The mill will submit samples of plate which have been poured and heat treated fo r ballistic acceptance testing; and foundry / process qualification. Once approved the foundry shall maintain the same process and follow a Q + A process with spot tests for continued ballistic tests.   4. A MIL SPEC is currently being staffed for this cast plate. It incorporates the historic armor strategy for wrought armor plate MIL A 12560 and cast armor  MIL A 11356 and for reference ASTM test methods.       POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT:   The Army is currently finalizing plate demand, sizes and delivery points.  The preliminary initial Gov demand for this plate is 10M Lbs. (total) with 2.5 M Lbs. / quarter with deliveries to begin in Dec 2007. This represents the initial demand. It is expec ted that there will be additional demand that follows upon this initial requirement. Any additional demand will likely be front loaded into the base demand NOT delivered after deliveries of the initial demand. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: 1. Plate Chemistry: A detailed chemistry range has been established but for the purposes of this request the nominal chemistry is a 4130 or 4330 alloy steel with reduced sulfur and phosphorus similar to levels attainable with VIM/VAR or ESR grades of steel .   2. This armor plate has slots at angles to the surface (drawing included). The drawing does not include any draft however any business consern is permitted to suggest a draft limit to permit ease of molding and pouring.  3. Plate Hardness: After heat treatment: 302  352 BHN (300kg-load) 4. Plate Sizes: Multiple plate sizes may ultimately be specified. Presently the order will be for plates 36 W x 30 H x 5/8 thk. The foundry may pour larger plates then cut to size.  5. Plate Flatness: Tolerance TBD: NOTE: Flatening in a press may be required after casting. 6. The mill shall be capable of in house chemical analysis and develop a Q + A process that includes pour records to ensure all plates deliveries conform to chemical and hardness requirements. 7.  All potenti al bidders shall have full capitalized  facility with the exception of tooling.  8. The plates shall be delivered to multiple locations in the US. 9. The GOV has a history of pouring this plate (in house, experimental)  in the past with a lost foam / loose bonded sand method; and can share this background with sketches of a gating system as Government Furnished Information.    RESPONSE INFO REQUESTED:  Business concerns must respond to all the areas indicated below: 1.	Indicate pour capability 2.	Melt method 3.	Heat treat capability 4.	Indicate ISO certification  5.	Major customers 6.	Designs of any prior plate-like, castings  (IE When, Quantity) 7.	Ability to pour this material 8.	Anticipated casting method 9.	Molding method, tool lead time, ROM tooling cost 10.	ROM production rate RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the Survey are requested no later then 30 calendar days after announcement is posted. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC:  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point.  The maximum size of each e-mail sh ould be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  Please submit electronic responses and any questions prior  to full response to Tom Furmaniak at tom.furmaniak@us.army.mil . Please format the subject line of the response email as follows; [Organization Name] response to P900 Plate Sources Sought Notice.   GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information  qualifying as COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:          1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriat ely protected.        2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness  of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected      3 The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another p arty through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,        4. Company Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and  at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.      5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restrict ion legend and any explanatory text.      6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Company Confidential w ill preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, 07EOMHA000008, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This requirement is set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 Software Publishers. The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase use of a hosted task project tracking application that will increase timeliness goals, efficiency, accuracy, and accountability of a wide range of tasks and projects across 5 offices within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA) offices located in Arlington, VA (2); Cleveland, OH; Irvine, CA; and Miami, FL.  
  

The period of performance shall be 12 months from the date of award with four successive 12 month option periods. 

The contractor shall provide a hosted task project tracking application, hosting services for the application, and training for users and administrators.  The contractor will provide access to the application in the base year for 100 full function users.  The application must be scalable to support a potential increase in the number of users to approximately 600.

Task or Project Tracking Application:  The application shall be capable of tracking and reporting deadlines and workload at the task level, and in addition, associating multiple tasks to projects.  The application shall provide standard project management capabilities including but not limited to work breakdown structure, Gantt charts, critical path analysis, and milestone tracking.  Task and project records must support the capability to attach associated documents; user-defined fields; E-mail notification of overdue tasks, completed tasks, new task assignments, etc.; labor hour tracking; and group and user-based access controls.

Hosting Services:  The hosted application shall be web-based, browser independent, and require no application-specific plug-ins or downloads to desktops.  All communications, including passwords, shall be SSL encrypted.  Hosting services shall include operating system and application patches, updates, and upgrades at no additional charge.

Users may require access to the full functionality of the application, or to limited (such as read/view only) functionality.  The contractor shall provide pricing on a percent basis for full function users and limited users. For evaluation purposes only, the offeror shall provide the unit price for full function users and limited function users. Increases in the number and types of user licenses made during the course of the initial 12-month contract or any of the subsequent option years will be prorated from the beginning of the month during which the change becomes effective.

The quantities stated herein are the Government?s best estimate and are provided for proposal preparation and evaluation purposes only. The actual quantity of licenses may vary.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers: technical merit, price and past performance. 

Technical evaluation will be based upon: 

1.   Task Management Capabilities.  25%

The offeror must describe how and to what extent tasks can be created by users and assigned by supervisors, task records can be customized with user definable data/fields, tasks can be prioritized, and tasks can be displayed by users in user-definable views based on multiple methods of sorting.

2.  Reporting.  25%

The offeror must describe how and to what extent the application provides both individual user and group roll-up views and how these views can be structured and sorted.  The contractor will describe how and to what extent the application provides user definable reports including but not limited to definable data/fields, definable sorts, and definable structures.

3.  Project Management Capabilities.  20%

The offeror must describe how and to what extent the application provides project management capabilities including but not limited to work breakdown structure, task dependencies, human resource scheduling, and analyses such as critical path, schedule and cost variance, and earned value.


4.   Automatic Time and Event Based Notifications and Assignments.  15%

The offeror must describe how and to what extend the application provides automatic e-mail notifications based on criteria such as tasks becoming overdue and task and project completion.  The contractor will describe how and to what extent the application provides automatic assignment of tasks and/or projects based on subject matter and/or other criteria.

5.   Access Control.  10%

The offeror must describe how and to what extent the application can provide access control from the perspectives of individual vs. group definitions and create/modify vs. read/view access as applied to task and project records, views, reports, and documents.

6. Past Performance. 5% 

If a proposal is received from an offeror that does not have a past performance rating of all offerors that submit technically acceptable proposals and apply the average rating to the offeror?s proposal. 


As part of the evaluation, the Government may require a demonstration of the product. The demonstration may be onsite in Arlington, VA; via web and conference call; web meeting; VTC; etc. at the offeror's option and at no cost to us.  Offerors may be assured that as long as their demonstration is effective, the method chosen will have no bearing on the evaluation. There is no requirement for an offeror to appear onsite.


The business proposal shall provide a firm-fixed unit price, inclusive of all transportation charges for base period and each option period. The fixed unit price per full function and limited function user shall be multiplied by the estimated quantity to determine the base period price. Award will be made on an all or nothing basis. Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government?s best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. 

The Contractor shall submit an original and three copies of its invoices monthly for additions or subtractions of users during each month.

EPA's Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN) recommends recycled content levels for purchasing office furniture as shown in the table below.
EPA's Recommended Recovered Materials Content Levels 
for Office Furniture Containing Recovered Steel, Aluminum, Wood, Agricultural Fiber and Plastic
Table G-9 from EPA website ? Recommended Recovered Materials Content Levels for Office Furniture


         Product	          Material	Postconsumer content	Total recovered materials content (%)
Furniture structure	Steel	16	25-30
Furniture structure	Aluminum	 -	75-100
Particleboard/
Fiberboard
Component
	Wood or wood composite
Agricultural
	Greater than 0

                    -	80-100

100
Fabric	PET	100	100
Plastic furniture component	HDPE	70-75	95
Remanufactured or Refurbished Furniture	Various	25-75	25-75


EPA's recommendations do not preclude a procuring agent from purchasing cafeteria furnishings made from other materials. They simply require that procuring agencies, when purchasing cafeteria furnishings made from steel, aluminum, wood or wood composite, agricultural fiber, PET, HDPE or various other materials purchase those items made from recovered materials when these items meet applicable specifications and performance requirements. 

Notes:  The recommended recovered material content levels for steel in this table reflect the fact that the designated item is generally made from steel manufactured in a Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF).   Steel from the BOF process contains 25-30% total recovered materials, of which 16% is postconsumer steel. 

Particleboard and fiberboard used in the wood components of office furniture may also contain other recovered cellulosic materials, including, but not limited to, paper, wheat straw and bagasse.  The percentages of these materials contained in the product would also count toward the recovered materials content level of the item.  In addition, while EPA has no evidence or indication that wood treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is currently used in office furniture, EPA is not recommending the use of CCA-treated wood as a recovered material in office furniture.  The arsenic in CCA is a known human-carcinogen and EPA is currently conducting a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment of CCA as a part of the pesticide reregistration process for CCA.  In addition, EPA is conducting a risk assessment for children who contact CCA-treated wood playsets and decks.

Specifications:  EPA did not identify any standards or specifications that would preclude Government agencies from purchasing office furniture with recovered materials content or remanufactured or refurbished office furniture.  The GSA requires that remanufactured furniture meet the same Underwriters Laboratories, ASTM and Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer?s Association standards and fire codes as new furniture.  


Installation consists of receiving, delivery from DFAS dock to cafeteria, setup including leveling, and trash removal. Any defective parts received will not be accepted and replaced within a reasonable time. All purchases are non taxable.

4.0  Invoicing Information:  Invoices shall be submitted to the COR/GPOC (Acceptor) as a 2-in-1 or Combo invoice via the internet using the Government provided Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) Receiving/Acceptance System at https://wawf.eb.mil.  (ref. clause 252.232-7003).  When the 2-in-1 or Combo invoice is received by the COR/GPOC via WAWF, the COR/GPOC will review the document and, if it is correct, accept it electronically and forward it for payment.  Web Base Training is available at www.wawftraining.com and for more information go to www.dod.mil/dfas and click the e-commerce link.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any
subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to
any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall
be treated as a partnership.

value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

<DESC>This notice is being provided in accordance with FAR Parts 5.203 (b), 5.207 and 13.105.

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank), a federal agency, intends to continue its current support with Sungard Computer Services, LLC (at 505 Huntmar Park Drive, Suite 100, Herndon, VA 22070) for provision of virtual data center services on a sole source basis for an eighteen month period (October 1, 2007 through March 31, 2009).  The Ex-Im Bank currently has a competitively awarded GSA FEDSIM task order in place with Sungard for these services, which expires September 30, 2007.  The Ex-Im Bank seeks to continue Sungard?s support of this requirement beyond the term of this order on an open market basis under the commercial buy procedures of FAR Part 12 (f)(1) at the dollar thresholds permitted under the simplified acquisition test program for commercial items at FAR Part 13.5 (e)(2).

The Ex-Im Bank is preparing to transition multiple business applications from a mid size IBM mainframe computer executing several old applications in an VM/VSE/Adabas Natural environment to internal hosting of these applications in an Intel/Java environment.  The mainframe rehosting requirement is being conducted as a separate fully competed action under FAR Part 15.  This transition effort, including the source selection to contract for those services, is anticipated to take eighteen months but may be completed sooner.  The applications to be transitioned are critical to the daily business of the Ex-Im Bank and relate directly to EXIM Online, the Ex-Im Bank?s initiative to provide its products and services in a web based environment for greater accessibility to U.S. Exporters.

Sungard also provides continuity of operations (COOP) support to Ex-Im Bank under a separate competitively awarded contract.  The disaster recovery and coordination aspects of the VDC support are intertwined with Sungard?s COOP responsibilities.
     
In consideration of the above described interdependencies, the Ex-Im Bank has determined that continuing our relationship with Sungard for VDC support until such time as those functions can be performed internally (on or before March 31, 2009) is the technical solution that provides the greatest reduction of technical and performance risk to the Ex-Im Bank.  SEE NOTE 22.

ALL COMMUNICATIONS IN REFERENCE TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE THROUGH USAC'S Contracting Office.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are  being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is W911W6-07-R-0036 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).

Question & Answer
06/12/2007

Question 1:  Since this contract is for part 91 flying and there was no mention of any limitation, I assume there is no age limit that will be imposed on contract pilots, correct?

Answer 1: There is no age limit for our operation.  As long as a pilot has an ATP, is typed 	in the equipment to be flown, has a current first or second class medical, and has been to a recurrent course in the past 12 months he is good to go.  Landings within the last 90 days are not a concern to us; we will accommodate that requirement if necessary.

Questions and Answers
06/11/2007

Question 1.  It appears the FFP line items we are being requested to quote are for 20, 120 and 80 flight days respectively, but the Q&A indicates that the government intention is to task this in smaller chunks.  Further examination of FAR 52.212 and the provided fill-ins indicates that the maximum order at any one time is for 20 flight days.  With this in mind, is the government requesting that vendors actually provide FFP quote figures on a "per flight day" basis?  Or is the idea that vendors submit pricing for the flight day quantities above, and you will then divide by the total to get a per day figure?  Since there is no SF 1449 with required blanks to fill in, we just want to ensure that our pricing submittal is compliant.  It occurs to us that a per flight day figure for each location may be more appropriate, since we also may be able to apply a volume discount scheme as allowed by the FAR.

ANSWER 1:  The estimates are for a period of performance of one year:  July 01, 2007 through June 30, 2008.  The line items should have stated, ?Unit Price per Flight Day $       ?.

Question 2.  Can you clarify the following language?  "The contractor remains legally responsible for each pilot provided under this contract and will supervise each pilot as defined at 5 USC 7103(a)(10)." The U.S. Code supervisory requirements are clear and certainly part of our business practices, but is there an intent to burden the contractor with some kind of liability requirements with this statement?  Does the government expect the contractor to carry aviation liability insurance for the operation of non-owned aircraft?  

ANSWER 2:  In accordance with FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) 37.104, the intent of this language is to make clear that the requirement is not a personal services contract.  It is the contractor?s choice to carry aviation liability insurance for the operation of non-owned aircraft. 

Question 3.  We have so far been unable to locate an electronic version of form USM-271.  Can this be made available or do you have a link where it may be downloaded?

ANSWER 3:  A form USM-271 wiil be e-mailed to anyone requesting the form.  Please send e-mail request to sandra.fink@usdoj.gov

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
06/08/2007


QUESTION 1:  FLIGHT DAYS: By ?flight days? ? can we expect these flight days would be sequential for the entire program (smallest footprint 220 days - one pilot per day ? start at one base until that base complete then start at the next base and so on), sequential at each base only but potentially overlapping the three bases (smallest footprint 120 days with periods where flight days are occurring simultaneously at all three bases), or overlapping to any extent (even up to the ridiculous extreme of 220 pilots all flying on one day.)  The question boils down to ? what is the maximum number of pilots you would require on ANY given day during the period of performance?

ANSWER 1:  Our use of contract pilots is designed to cover extenuating circumstances that are brief in nature.  We may need a contract pilot to fill a vacant slot for only one day in one office during a given period of time.  We may need that same pilot for a series of days ? say 5days and then not again for some time, if ever.  These are not regularly filled positions.  The need is sporadic and temporary in nature.  The amount of duty time or days of involvement will be passed to you when a request for help is published.  Our minimum liability for contract pilots at any given moment will vary significantly from 0 to as many as 3 to 6 throughout the unit.

QUESTION 2:  SIC / PIC:  Would our pilot(s) be expected to be PIC all the time, occasionally, or never?  Since the solicitation allows for class I or II medical, I assume our pilot(s) will be SIC only, never PIC.  Will our pilots expect to land the aircraft all the time, occasionally, or never?

ANSWER 2:  Contract pilots are never given the responsibility of PIC.  They will forever participate as SIC.  As the SIC they will not be given a landing until, in the judgment of the PIC, a positive working rapport has been established and a familiarity with JPATS operating procedures has been gained.  In other words a confidence level has been achieved.

QUESTION 3:  PROCEDURES: I expect they would operate as JPATS crewmembers and abide by JPATS operating procedures ? there are likely many details of those operating procedures that could have significant impact on pricing, likewise, they would be extended the same considerations as the current full time pilots of the JPATS under these operating procedures (such as duty day and flight time limitations that would constitute one complete ?flight day?).  Is there any chance you could forward or make available to me (through a web link possibly) the operating procedures that our pilots would fall under?

ANSWER 3:  Generally we adhere to an 8 hour flight day and a 12 hour duty day.  Our limitations are 38 hours per week, 100 hours a month and 1000 hours a year.  Our flights average 6.5 in the aircraft which usually translates to a 10 to 12 hour duty day.
 

QUESTION 4:  RESOURCES & EQUIPPAGE: Will all flight planning be done at JPATS facilities using JPATS resources and publications?  Will our pilots have at their disposal JPATS in flight publications or will they be expected to bring their own for all eventualities?  Do the aircraft have their own headsets with boom mics OR will JPATS issue these OR will our pilot(s) be expected to have his or her own?  Will our pilots abide by JPATS dress code for flying or will you want them individually identifiable?

ANSWER 4:  JPATS will provide all maps and charts.  All aircraft have headsets, however it never hurts to bring one if it is available.  Our trips are usually four to five stop in duration.  Most are out and back from the point of origin.  We do have occasional over night stops.  The schedule will be made available to the contract pilot so he may know what is expected for a particular assignment.  A short sleeve polo type shirt in gray is what our pilots wear along with black slacks and black shoes or boots.  Ex-airline folks have shown up in a short sleeve airline shirt which is acceptable.  Polo shirts in subdued colors are acceptable (black, white, and blue).

QUESTION 5:  NORMAL FLIGHT PROFILE: The flight profile our pilot(s) would have to support at any given base could range from a ?turn? every day beginning and ending (or at least planning to) every day at the base to one long trip for the entire duration of the expected number of flight days contracted at that base.  What can be expected as the normal trip length or does it vary considerably?  Are there certain locations that you regularly have your crews overnight if they depart on trips or does it constantly vary?

ANSWER 5:  See Answer 1.

QUESTION 6:  TRAINING: In the interest of safety, it would be appropriate to expect some period of training to be provided for our pilot(s) in operating procedures and crew coordination on JPATS flights but there does not seem to be any provision for integration training.  At a minimum I would think a day or two of ground school taught by JPATS to include operating procedures, CRM standards, facilities orientation and a safety equipment and special equipment walk around would be necessary.  Would it be reasonable to assume that JPATS would make the facilities, personnel, and aircraft available to support this in advance of flights with contractors commencing at any given base?
 
ANSWER 6:  JPATS recognizes the liability attendant with the use of contract pilots and to the extent possible attempts to mitigate that liability are made.  We do not provide lengthy ground schools.  We expect to invite professional aviators who have considerable experience and have developed good habits associated with the professional disciplines required to operate in today?s air traffic environment.  The PIC will provide the contract pilot with a briefing which will entail an overview of our procedures, checklists and expectations.  That briefing may take place 2 hours prior to the flight or we may attempt to provide a more complete pre-flight briefing to the extent that all parties are available to participate.  We are quite busy and occasionally understaffed.  If we had pilots available for more extensive briefings, we would not find it necessary to occasionally contract for one. 
As a minimum we require all contract pilots to hold an FAA issued ATP Certificate.  They must be type rated in the aircraft they will be assigned to fly and must be able to show proof of having completed re-current training in the aircraft in question within the last 12 months.  Time in type is preferred.  Trainees (time in type) are an unwarranted liability.  We want to encourage the participation of experienced professional pilots.
 
Currently the majority of our contract requirements are found in Alexandria, LA (B737-300) and Phoenix, AZ (MD83).

<DESC>The following security requirements are hereby incorporated as Amendment 0002 to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation and shall be applied as follows:   

Implementing Instructions for Compliance with HSAR clause 3052.204-71, ?Contractor Employee Access? 

1.    GENERAL

Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) clause 3052.204-71 requires that contractor personnel requiring unescorted access to government facilities, access to sensitive information, or access to government information technology (IT) resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract. 

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy requires a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract for all contractor personnel who require recurring access to government facilities or access to sensitive information, or access to government IT resources.

Contractor employees will be given a suitability determination unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.  Requirements for suitability determination are defined in paragraph 3.0.

1.1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS:

Performance of this contract requires the Contractor to gain access to classified National Security Information (includes documents and material).  Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, National Security Information (NSI) as amended and supplemental directives.  

The Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, an attachment to the contract, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the Contractor is required to have access to classified information at a DHS or other Government Facility, it shall abide by the requirements set forth by the agency.

1.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENT:

The Contractor shall ensure these instructions are expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this contract.

2.   CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL

2.1	EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY

To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy, the contractor must complete the following forms for applicable personnel who will be performing work under this contract as indicated:
?	Standard Form (SF) 85P, ?Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions?
?	FD-258 fingerprint cards 
?	DHS Form 11000-6, ?Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement?. Required of all applicable contractor personnel.  
?	DHS Form 11000-9, ?Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)?
. 


2.2	CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY

The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on contracts if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns.  

2.3	TERMINATION

The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence.  The Contractor shall return to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report shall be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to who it was issued and the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.


3.0	SUITABILITY DETERMINATION

DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary suitability checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow.  A favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar DHS from withdrawing or terminating access government facilities or information, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office.

Contract employees waiting for an EOD decision may begin work on the contract provided they do not access sensitive Government information.  Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the Contractor is escorted by a Government employee.  This limited access is to allow Contractors to attend briefings, non-recurring meetings and begin transition work.

4.0 BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS

Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, requiring access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through the DHS Security Office.  Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the DHS Security Office.  The Standard Form 85P will be completed electronically, through the Office of Personnel Management?s e-QIP SYSTEM.  The completed forms must be given to the DHS Security Office no less than thirty (30) days before the start date of the contract or thirty (30) days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:

a.	Standard Form 85P, ?Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions?

b.	FD Form 258, ?Fingerprint Card?  (2 copies)

c.	DHS Form 11000-6 ?Conditional Access To Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement?

d.	DHS Form 11000-9, ?Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act?

Only complete packages will be accepted by the DHS Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  
Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department?s Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted:
(1) The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U. S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State;
(2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U. S. citizen; and
(3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government.
4.1 ALTERNATIVE CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-IT CONTRACTS
For non-Classified or non-IT contracts the above citizenship provision shall be replaced with the citizenship provision below:
Each individual employed under the contract shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by a Permanent Resident Card (USCIS I-55 1). Any exceptions must be approved by the Department?s Chief Security Officer or designee.

5.0 INFORMATION TECHOLOGY SECURITY CLEARANCE

When sensitive government information is processed on Department telecommunications and automated information systems, the Contractor shall provide for the administrative control of sensitive data being processed. Contractor personnel must have favorably adjudicated background investigations commensurate with the defined sensitivity level.

Contractors who fail to comply with Department security policy are subject to having their access to Department IT systems and facilities terminated, whether or not the failure results in criminal prosecution.  Any person who improperly discloses sensitive information is subject to criminal and civil penalties and sanctions under a variety of laws (e.g., Privacy Act).

Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access.


6.0 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT

Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS.

<DESC>This amendment to Solicitation number W31P4Q-07-T-2007 is being issued to extend closing date for receipt of request for quotes regarding subject combined solicitation/synopsis below and to post requested answers to technical questions.   Closing dat e for receipt of request for quotes is extended from 2 July 2007, noon (CST) timeframe given in original announcement TO 13 July 2007, noon (CST).  Graph of Noise Profile will be provided via e-mail upon request. TECHNICAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ASKED: 1.    Is site-clearing required by the contractor? No 2.    Will excavation and grading be required by the contractor? 	No 3.    Will a slab be provided by the contractor? 	There is an existing slab 4.    Are utility connections points available near the proposed site? How far? 	Yes, in the same building.  Contractor just needs to supply connection points to chamber.  Local technicians will provide hookup. 5.    Are there requirements for dynamometer cooling water system? 	Not currently  6.    Are there requirements for an engine air start system? 	Not currently 7.    Are there requirements for a control room or equipment room? 	No 8.    Are there detailed specs for the lights and outlets, i.e. operating environment? Not sure what is being asked for.  Explosion proof lights and outlets are not required.  Prefer low profile fluorescent lighting. 9.    Are there requirements for conduit runs within the test cell? No 10.   Will a hoist or engine handling system be required by the contractor? No 11.   Will a connection to sanitary sewer be required by the contractor? 	No 12.   Will an oil/water separator be required by the contractor? 	No 13.   The 50dBA noise criterion is achievable only if the source is defined. Most helpful would be a specific engine type and associated noise spectrum. 	The source is a 40  100 hp heavy fuel Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) engine.  The current 40hp engine generates around 130 dBA within 4-5 feet of the exhaust pipe.  This should represent a worst case sound pressure level.  The only noise spectrum informati on we have is from a ground run of the current 40hp engine (see below).  It is not known if this would be representative of all engines in the desired size range (40-100).
