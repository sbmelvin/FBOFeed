AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utility Privatization Grissom AFRC, Indiana Natural Gas Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is Jul 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Grissom ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way.  The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate.  The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are:  None.
Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSC) supplies natural gas to Grissom Air Reserve Base under an interruptible gas service contract. This type of contract allows the local utility to curtail gas service to customers on the interruptible agreement under extreme weather conditions when their priority customers, e.g., hospitals and residential customers, require the supply of additional gas. 
A single eight-inch (8”) pipeline enters the base at a fenced compound and runs alongside Harry Forman Drive.  Gas service is supplied to the base at 55 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) through a regulating station located on the service main ahead of the metering station and the installation distribution network.  The gas main passes through one metering and valve station, and gas is distributed to each facility at a reduced but variable pressure.  NIPSC owns and maintains the odorizing equipment.  There is a limited amount of tracer wire on the remaining system.  However the exact location and amount is unknown.  
The natural gas is distributed throughout the main base through approximately four miles of underground pipeline.  These lines are owned entirely by Grissom ARB.  The average depth of burial is 36”.  The gas main is constructed of either polyethylene pipe (PE), or in some locations, high-density polyethylene (HDPE).  There are 32 buildings within the cantonment area supplied natural gas directly.  The majority are not separately metered.  Grissom ARB deactivated their steam plant August 2000.  All facilities within the cantonment area are on alternative heating systems.
The NIPSC central metering point located was relocated from just inside the fence to a point by the truck scales.  There are ten government owned secondary metering points on base.  
The most significant impact to the natural gas system was the deactivation of the central steam heat plant and the construction of new support facilities inside the cantonment area.  A study of the heat plant identified potential energy savings in gas demand of 20-30% by converting individual buildings to alternative independent heating systems.  Additionally, the new facilities, while adding over 285,000-sq. ft. of heating space, replace over 400,000-sq. ft. of older less energy efficient structures.  The combined savings from both programs are estimated at 33.5% gas demand.
Grissom’s natural gas piping system is relatively new.  The entire gas main piping network was replaced under several different contracts between 1989 and 1997.  The mains include both PE and HDPE pipe according to construction drawings and discussions with NIPSC and shop personnel.  The specific locations and ranges of each type of distribution piping are not identifiable with assured accuracy. 
NIPSC provides maintenance on an as needed and emergency-repair arrangement with the base.  Over the last four years, only minor maintenance repairs were required.  NIPSC identified and satisfactorily corrected each problem.  NIPSC also maintains the repair records and documentation.

<DESC><p>The Air Force is sending more Airmen "outside the wire" as our adversaries are armed with tactics and strategies that challenge traditional warfighter capabilities. Mission requirements demand prolonged and repeated exposures to unpredictable and hostile environments, rendering our troops vulnerable to reduced readiness and unidentifiable adversaries. The charter of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Biosciences and Protection Division (AFRL/RHP) is to create physical and cognitive sanctuaries to ensure combat survivability, extend human performance, and protect the force. Two major areas of research are: Biobehavioral Performance and Biomechanics. The Biobehavioral and Performance Branch (RHPG) conducts research to ensure human, individual and team, physical and cognitive performance in operational and extreme environments. The Biomechanics Branch (RHPA) conducts research in biomechanics, anthropometry, and analytic sciences to ensure performance and safety for all Airmen. The research goal of these two Branches is to enable the human weapon system to meet the current and future battlefield challenges through their biobehavioral performance and biomechanics research.</p>

<p>As the only active duty base in the LA area, Los Angeles Air Force Base (LA AFB) is home of the 61st Air Base Wing and Space and Missile Systems Center - the Air Force's premier space acquisition center. Located in the heart of the city near LAX, LA AFB is home to military and their families, as well as an employer to over 5,000 civilian employees.</p>
<p>Every year LA AFB hosts a base wide day of team building and esprit de corps which draws crowds of 800 people. This is a great opportunity to raise customer awareness of your company with this exclusive military demographic.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Los Angeles AFB invites you to join in supporting the morale, welfare and recreation of our military and their family members by becoming a commercial sponsor for Sports Day this 10th of July. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. <br />In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event.

<DESC>Installation Contracting Command, Regional Contracting Center-Fort Bragg, North Carolina intends to award, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a contract to Kipper Tool Company, 2375 Murphy Blvd, Gainesville, GA 30504 for Kipper Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) Rescue Kits to support the Aviation Brigade requirements.  The inception of an alternative Rescue kit would drastically impair the mission of the 82nd CAB. The requested items are to be used in the Brigade to support downed aircraft recovery operations, IED Extraction and patient recovery for the assigned Medevac crews. The Brigade must be prepared to deploy in response to conflicts, natural disaster relief, and other operations at a moments notice and the currently utilized Kipper ALSE Rescue Kit is an integral part of this function. The design of the kit allows for rapid loading/unloading onto vehicles or aircraft in the event of an emergency as well as rapid inventory and accountability during actual operations or command change inventories.  The Brigade first purchased the item in October, 2005 and has since trained extensively on this particular kit and become familiar with all aspects of operations utilizing the kit. Each unit within the 82nd CAB was provided with a week long onsite training seminar conducted by the vendor. The training included equipment set-up, operation and concluded with simulated exercises using old automobiles. All subsequent training using the ALSE Rescue Kit has been conducted utilizing what was learned during the training seminar. It would be detrimental to the 82nd CAB to have to become re-acclimated to the use of a generic or alternative product. The unit would suffer the cost and expended man-hours of retraining each unit on the use of another kit. In addition to the costs of training, the inception of an alternative Rescue Kit would mean training in combat operations as well as disaster relief operations at the home station would not coincide with the training being conducted in theater using the previously purchased Kipper ALSE Rescue Kits. This is not a request for Competitive Proposals.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If you feel your firm possesses the ability to provide these supplies, you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet the requirement.  If no affirmative written response is received, the supplies will be awarded without further notice.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the email address provided below no later than 19 June 2008, 3:00pm Eastern Time.  POC for this notice is Brandon Hawkins, Phone# (910) 907-5144 or Email: brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil

<DESC>This solicitation will be posted on or about June 18, 2008. 
The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is contracting to acquire detailed information regarding the most commonly diverted drugs. Specifically, a detailed, comprehensive characterization of prescription drug diversion is needed. This project will achieve that goal by determining whether the methods by which prescription drugs are purchased conform to distinct patterns and whether those patterns are indicative of suspicious behavior. 

The government also requires an assessment of the magnitude of prescription drug diversion. Having first identified the methods of acquisition associated with commonly diverted prescription drugs (as detailed above), this project will estimate the proportion of prescription drugs that are likely diverted from the legitimate market either for illicit resale or abuse.

Finally, the need exists for an evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. The project will analyze prescription drug acquisition patterns and trends throughout the United States and will develop estimates of prescription drug diversion in each of the 50 U.S. states. Those estimates of diversion will then be used to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence or absence of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and the estimated diversion in each state.

Vendors shall not contact ONDCP regarding this solicitation. Contacting ONDCP may jeopardize any offer submitted on behalf of the vendor. 

Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<a href="mailto:annemarie.bird@emcbc.doe.gov">Anne Marie Bird, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>DOE intends to negotiate a sole-source 24 month extension to thecurrentcontract (DE-AC05-O1OR22877) with the United States Enrichment Corporation(USEC), 6903 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817-1818.  The anticipatedawarddate is on or before September 30, 2008.  The period of performance (PoP)willbe for an additional 24 months from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2010,withspecific tasks being completed at different times during the PoP.  USEC isthesole lessee of the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) enrichmentfacilities under rights provided pursuant to the USEC Privatization Act(theJuly 1, 1993 GDP Lease) and possesses the only Nuclear RegulatoryCommission(NRC) Certificate of Compliance (CoC) to operate the PGDP uraniumenrichmentfacilities.  The contract extension will be divided into two distinct taskswith a defined work scope assigned to each task.The first work scope task, anticipated to complete by the end of FY2010, istoprovide deactivation activities in USEC leased facilities that are insupportof the transition of PGDP to D&D (decontamination and decommissioning).Deactivation activities are those that focus on minimizing siteinfrastructureand utilities essential to the Departments mission.  Specific tasksincludecontinuing removal of material deposits, including Highly Enriched Uraniumdeposits, removal and disposition of hazardous liquids and environmentallysensitive materials (e.g., PCB liquids).The second work scope task is to provide surveillance and maintenance (S&M)anddeactivation functions for the X-333 facility and any other similar PGDPfacilities returned by USEC to DOE under the GDP Lease.  This task isexpectedto be completed by the end of FY2009 with the transition of S&M activitiesto anew Management and Integration (M&I) contractor that will support DOE intheD&D of the Portsmouth site.  The work scope associated with this taskincludesan extension of the current S&M processes with the X-333 facility and anyothersimilar PGDP facilities returned by USEC to DOE under the GDP Lease,including:continued surveillance and maintenance activities essential for nuclearcriticality safety/radiological safety and documented facility safetyrequirements; continued site infrastructure, utilities, and securityservicesessential to multiple user site operations and national security.  USECshallalso prepare documentation to support the transition from the current NRCregulatory environment to an Atomic Energy Act/DOE Authorization Basis incompliance with the Atomic Energy Act and DOE orders.  USEC shall alsopreparedocumentation to support the transition to the new M&I contractor that willbeassuming the S&M responsibility.USEC possesses the only NRC CoC to operate the PGDP and has the necessaryapproved programs and procedures and certified personnel for performingboththe deactivation and S&M functions under the NRC license.  USECs NRC CoC,approved programs, procedures, certified personnel, and experience, andleaseagreement at the PGDP site makes it uniquely qualified to execute thetransition from the NRC regulatory framework to the Atomic Energy Act/DOEAuthorization Basis.  Under this contract, USEC will continue the returnandtransition of facilities and systems to DOE at the PGDP in a safe andsecuremanner.  The estimated value of this contract extension, including bothtasks,is approximately $130,000,000 to $150,000,000 through FY2010.Point of ContactPamela Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 859-219-4056, Fax 859-219-4097,Email Pam.thompson@lex.doe.gov; or David Senderling, Contract Specialist,Phone859-219-4054, Fax 859-219-4097, Email david.senderling@lex.doe.gov.Place of PerformanceAddress:  Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Piketon, OhioPostal Code:  45661Country:  USA

This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201. However, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation.  The resulting contract will be considered repair and maintenance of real property and thus Davis Bacon Wage Rates and construction contract terms and conditions will apply.
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION. 
The work to be performed under this contract consists of furnishing, obtaining, and providing all labor, equipment, materials, and supplies to complete the restoration of the Fish Creek and Helm Bay cabins. This includes, but may not be limited to the replacement of foundations, decks, roofs, windows, doors, chimney, furniture, refurbishing of interior and staining of exterior walls, and other listed items.

The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete project described in the contract. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract.

The cabins have been reserved for four weeks each during the month of September 2008 for the contractors use.  The contractor is allowed to use cabins during these time periods for crew camp facilities and this will also be the completion time for the contract. 
  
PROJECT LOCATION. 
The Fish Creek cabin is located on the north end of Thorne Arm, and Helm Creek cabin is located on the east shore of Helm Bay near the mouth of Helm Creek.  Both cabins are located on the Ketchikan-Misty Fiords Ranger District.  Both cabins are only accessed by boat or float plane.

OBTAINING A SOLICITATION.

However, a prospective bidder may request a paper copy by faxing a note to 907.228.6254 specifically requesting a paper copy of solicitation RFQ AG-0116-S-08-0043.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters(HQ) plans to continue an existing agreement for the operation ofGlobal Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA).  GEIA is a major crosscutting activity of theInternational Geosphere-Biosphere Program.  Since 1990 GEIA has been developing anddistributing inventories of global gas and aerosol emissions from natural andanthropogenic sources.	GEIA provides the highest quality information on air emissionsand global exchange processes for comprehensive global assessments of past, present andfuture atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate change.  GEIAs mission coversseveral themes -New Inventories, Inter-comparisons and Evaluations, PrioritiesObservations, Databases of Driving Variables, Temporal Variations, Chemical ExchangeModels, Validation Using Observations and Global/ Regional Chemistry-transport Models.	NASA Headquarters intends to continue its sponsorship with GEIAs network, news on dataand events of interest to the global community.  The network includes almost 625 peoplearound the globe.  There is no other organization in the industry that can provide such aunique blend of International Geosphere-Biosphere Programs.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), plans to procure on a sole source basis for a AKTA Automated Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System with GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, NJ 08855. 

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.



The following salient characteristics apply to the AKTA chromatography system:

•	The system must be compatible with the AKTA system’s controller, fraction collector, sample pump and detection monitor. 

•	The system must be capable of being controlled with Unicorn software. 

•	The Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system shall have flow rates of 0.01 to 20 mL/min at pressures up to 5 MPa.  The system must be equipped with a system pump, a mixer for precision gradient formation, an injection valve, UV/pH/conductivity monitor with fixed wavelength detection, a Fraction collector for collecting up 120 samples in 16 mm tubes and 8 samples in 30 mm tubes, system start-up, and two (2) 25MPA valves.

•	The system shall have the ability to be sanitized without removing columns and possibly introducing air into the system.  

•	The motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves shall be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.  

•	The system shall be able to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell culture supernatants, and recombinant protein expression systems; to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.
 
	
PART II - FACTS AND REASONS TO JUSTIFY OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Statute: 13.106-(b)(1)

	(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers  may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization.


Justification

The laboratory has invested considerable funds in chromatography columns and fittings which are compatible with AKTA systems only. Acquisition of a competing FPLC system will necessitate the purchase of new chromatography columns and fittings which are expensive. Discarding the columns from the old system would generate waste, which is contraindicated by the NEMS (NIH Environmental Management System).  Laboratory staff have used the AKTA system in another section and learned how to use the control and analysis software. This is significant as the powerful and sophisticated software that runs this and competing systems takes time to learn. If a competing system were acquired, additional time would be required to learn the software and to write new programs. Also, there would not be other users with experience around to offer guidance.  Having all sections of the LMB use the same chromatography system provides system back up and sharing of consumables, methods, and accessories. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on June ___, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80096-MM on all correspondence.

This control software will be imported to run within an Application Program Interface on the CDU-7000.  The Government does not possess the rights to rehost the CDU-900 control software for the purpose of modifying, updating and maintaining the USN/USMC control software into any device other than a Rockwell Collins device.  As the designer, developer, and OEM for the CDU-7000, Rockwell Collins is the only company that has the ability, resources, technology, and documentation necessary to modify, develop, produce, maintain, and support these systems. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The estimated period of performance is 24 months beginning after contract award. This is not for introduction of new common cockpit systems into existing platforms.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511210   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ingenuity Systems, 1700 Seaport Blvd. Redwood City, CA 94063 for the renewal of two(2)Ingenuity Pathways Analysis concurrent licensefor one year with unlimited user accounts. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results. Using a researcher's gene or protein dataset in combination with Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. Specifically it: A. supports genomic and proteomic data analysis; B. enables discovery of novel genes, proteins and interactions (canonical) pathways; C. allows expansion of pathways to identify putative targets; D. contains manually curated pathways from full-text scientific literature (Not just abstracts); E. allows comparisons of 2 groups of pathways; F. allows user creation of a pathway from a set of genes; G. develops pathways from an input genelist on the "fly", meaning it develops a pathway from just that set of genes and no others. This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an "interactomic fashion". There are no pathways analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. This software is presently being used to support an ongoing research project at EPA. As such, it is required for continuity of data analyses for the project.  In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02),RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711,  by fax (919)541-1075 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov .

<DESC><p>Description:<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) is issuing this RFI in an effort to conduct market research to solicit and survey industry for potential sources that may have the technical capability to meet its requirements and potential solutions for providing financial risk management software packages and support services related to Asset-Liability and Economic Capital Models (ECM in general). The ECM being developed by OFHEO will be used to provide alternative risk-based capital measures to supplement the statutory measures of capital adequacy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), and to supplement market and credit risk focused examinations. OFHEO is seeking an ECM software solution and desires to see what software technology products exist in the market. See attached for detailed information about requirements related to this RFI.
<p><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance restrict the Government on its eventual acquisition approach. This is an RFI only, and all information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however, information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition planning purposes.

<DESC><p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) ensures the capital adequacy and the financial safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises). OFHEO currently uses both a minimum capital measure and a risk-based capital measure to assess the capital adequacy of the Enterprises. OFHEO is currently developing an Economic Capital Model (ECM) from a regulatory perspective. The purpose of the ECM is to provide alternative risk-based capital measures to supplement the statutory measures of capital adequacy of the Enterprises. In general, economic capital refers to any risk-based measure of capital necessary to protect against unexpected losses over a given period of time and at a given confidence level. In developing the ECM, OFHEO is considering a multiple models approach to mitigate model risk. Specifically, OFHEO may develop several different measures of each of credit, market, and operational risk.
<p>OFHEO requires the services of a contractor to provide expert advice and recommendations on both the overall methodology of the multiple models approach, and on the practical implementation of the various models, or stress tests, being considered as components of the ECM. The contractor's advice and recommendations would take into consideration industry best practices as they would be applied to oversight of the Enterprises, and any practical or implementation realities confronting OFHEO to achieve a production process for determining a risk-based capital requirement on at least a quarterly basis. Also the contractor's advice and recommendations will be required to be accompanied by supporting discussion and documentation that OFHEO may reference in support of any new or revised capital-related regulations or guidances. In addition, the contractor may be required to provide expert advice and recommendations on the identification and acquisition of vendor models and data for use in the ECM. The offeror selected under this contract is precluded from offering relevant models and data.</p>
<p>OFHEO anticipates soliciting and awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a total of three years with fixed labor rates applicable to each year. Work will be issued via task orders. Tasks may vary in length and may be intermittent. The contractor must be able to provide services on short notice. This Request for Proposal (RFP) is unrestricted. NAICS Code 541690 is applicable, and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. It is anticipated that Solicitation No. OFHEO-08-R-0001 will be released on or about July 9, 2008, via posting on this website. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available. All offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>All questions and correspondence shall be addressed to Janice Uthe at janice.uthe@ofheo.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility, on a sole source basis, to provide secure care and related services to select children in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) Division of Unaccompanied Children’s Services (DUCS) custody.  These select children require placement in or transfer to a secure detention facility due to their criminal history, disruptive behavior or escape risk.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be for one base year from date of contract award with four option years.

This project provides secure services in the required geographic area within 2 hours driving time to San Francisco, CA immigration court.  It is essential that care provider accepts both ORR initial placements and transfers.  It is essential that the care provider has extensive experience working with Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC).  Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility is the sole responsible source in this geographic area that meets these requirements.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  Any interested source, in order to meet the requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) a location within a 2 hour drive of the San Francisco, CA immigration court (2) extensive experience working with UAC’s in an established facility.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted by 5 pm June 30, 2008 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.

The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factor as the requirement for acceptability:  Relevant Past Performance:  A minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past five (5) years that demonstrate the company's experience on projects that are similar to this project in terms of complexity, size and dollar value.  A similar project is defined as one whose main requirement was the paving and reconstruction of a parking lot and roadways sited at an occupied facility (Governmental, Courthouse or Institutional) at a total contract award amount of $100,000.00 or more.  All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability, but shall not be ranked using non-cost/ price factors.

Description.  The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command intends to award a follow-on, 5 year, Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract for continuation of the Lightweight Family of Weapons and Ammunition (LFWA)/Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) Technology Base Project,. This contract continues the development of technologies to reduce the weight and size of current small caliber weapons and ammunition, originally developed under the  LFWA contract W15QKN-04-C-1085 and its modifications.   Some of the technologies developed under that contract include caseless and cased telescoped ammunition, weapon recoil mitigation, materials technologies, and thermal management.  The contractor shall continue the development and maturation of these technologies so that they can be transitioned to a System Development and Demonstration phase, to be executed by the Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  The focus of this effort will be risk mitigation of the caseless ammunition, which offers the greatest weight and size reduction payoff, but still presents substantial risk at this stage of development.  The other technologies will also continue to be developed using a systems engineering approach, to increase the chance of success for the integrated system.
The focus of this effort will be on the critical technologies needed to achieve weapons and ammunition which are lightweight and compact, yet provide maximum lethality, accuracy and reliability at a reasonable cost.  These critical technologies have already been identified as follows:
	Advanced Ammunition (Caseless or Cased Telescoped)	Materials Technologies	Advanced modeling and simulation to identify the most effective design and use of materials	Thermal Management, including control of heat output from ammunition and the mitigation of heat throughout the weapon system	  None of the technologies can operate independently of the others and achieve the desired performance, therefore these technologies must be developed using a parallel, integrated system approach.
Place of Performance.  Hunt Valley, MD
Numbered Note 22 will apply to this Synopsis and resulting Solicitation.

<DESC>Mobile District intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bellsouth Telecommunications, 2180 Lake Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30319 to provide voice/data communications and equipment for the Mobile District Corps of Engineers pursuant to the authority under FAR 6.302. The service area consists of remote locations throughout Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida for various Corps offices located at parks, locks and dams, and military installations. This service was a part of an A-76 Competitive Study and is due to be taken over by an ACE-IT contractor in the near future. A change to a new provider at this time would increase cost and the potential for an additional change once the new Service Provider begins service. Bellsouth has been providing these services to the field office locations for numerous years and to disrupt service with Bellsouth would impact the Corps by losing service in these remote locations, losing investments in equipment and installation costs and pose compatibility problems between current equipment and replacement equipment if another vendor were selected. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive propsosals. However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.

<DESC><p>This is a sources sought/market research notice conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, Market Research. Bolling AFB is seeking information from all interested parties capable of developing an enterprise, multi-user database system to manage their complex ceremonial operations missions. 11th Operations Group has a time-sensitive, mission-critical need for ASD development in support of the USAF Band and Honor Guard. To perform its mission, 11th Operations Group uses an obsolete scheduling database to support the Band and Honor Guard. Therefore, the 11th Operations Group is unable to effectively and efficiently manipulate this data to meet on-going mission requirements. This scheduling process demands accurate and timely representation of the data. The Band and Honor Guard are using a Microsoft Access-based application that was developed in-house over many years and has been maintained/upgraded by several generations of band members. Because of the complexity of the system and expansion of its user base, the application has outgrown the Access platform and has become difficult to use and unreliable--there is now great potential for mission failure. Developing/launching a replacement system is a high priority requirement.
<p><br />2) All interested parties are encouraged to provide information on their capabilities to meet this requirement to develop a scheduling database or commercial off-the-shelf product, implementation, training and maintenance. Additionally, the database must be interoperable with the Air Force Outreach Request System (AFORS), a web-based system that manages the inflow of requests for Band and Speaker appearances.</p>

<p><br />4) The database system should consist of, but not limited to the following: Database Backend<br />a. Microsoft SQL Server 2005<br />i. SQL Script to generate database<br />ii. Script to import data from previous Access DB<br />iii. Documentation<br />1. Transaction descriptions<br />2. Entity relationship model<br />Web Client<br />b. Technical Specs <br />i. ASP.NET 2.0 <br />1. Code in Visual Basic<br />2. rights to use/modify all code<br />3. Design<br />4. Documentation<br />ii. Security <br />1. Windows Authentication with CAC enabled logins<br />2. Integrated and extensible self managing permission through Personnel Duty Manager<br />3. Allow access as needed<br />4. Utilize SSL with a DOD cert<br />iii. Email<br />1. Integration with Bolling/AFNCR Exchange Server<br />2. Extensible email notification and reminders<br />3. One-way updates to Public Folder Calendars<br />Interface<br />iv. Query and Reporting<br />1. Extensible Access-like Graphical Query interface to enable custom user reports<br />2. Custom Savable user reports<br />3. Allow generation of reports on SQL trigger<br />4. Predefined reports<br />v. Group Scheduling<br />1. Create and modify jobs/activities<br />a. Assign groups and personnel<br />i.

<SOLNBR>4QFQ97086101
<RESPDATE>063008
<CONTACT>Deborah E. Joeckel, Email deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov - Eddie Mills, Customer Account Manager, Phone 256-895-5914, Email eddie.mills@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (GSA-FTS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this request for information to industry.  The HPCMP is considering pursuing a multi-year contract for the purchase and maintenance of commercially-supported storage lifecycle management (SLM) software (combining information lifecycle management and hierarchical storage management) to support the HPCMP’s HPC Centers’ data file management and archival requirements.  In addition, limited direct technical services in support of customer-specific software enhancements and installations may also be pursued.  It is envisioned that the contract will provide a capability for the HPCMP for approximately 10 years beginning in fiscal year 2009.  Software products from Sun Microsystems Inc. are currently addressing the hierarchical storage management requirement.  Currently the HPCMP is responsible for a wide variety of allocated HPC-class systems distributed across 6 large computing centers.  The HPCMP web-site www.hpcmo.hpc.mil provides links to activities and resources associated with the Program.

As a part of the early stages of formulating this acquisition, the GSA is surveying potential candidates for participation as well as seeking early input that will assist in formulating the architecture of the contract.  Items of interest include:

a.	Storage Lifecycle Management consists of a layered software capability that manages locality and retention of data files by providing the ability to associate metadata to those data files, and to report on and to act on that metadata in conjunction with HPCMP-specified policies.  The SLM capability will determine how and where to provide most efficient storage for those data files, and will identify when data files no longer need to be retained.  HPCMP users commonly perform computations on multiple HPC systems, so the SLM-based  system must provide the ability for data files to be accessible from multiple HPC systems in a center and should facilitate the development of a capability for wide-area sharing of data files between HPCMP centers.  The HPCMP Disaster Recovery (DR) facility will be an integral part of the information lifecycle management and hierarchical storage capability provided through SLM.  Sample characteristics of the SLM are provided in Exhibit 1.

b.	The Government considers the significant scale of implementation associated with the selected product(s) coupled with the long term commitment to the selected product, maintenance and services to be unique.  As a function of this, the HPCMP is pursuing a correspondingly unique software licensing and pricing model.  This is envisioned to go beyond traditional “volume discounts” to view the HPCMP requirement as a long term conglomerate of  dynamically changing and growing resources versus an assembly of many pieces that incrementally change from year to year.  The GSA is seeking input from industry with respect to an industry-acceptable licensing model that can effectively address this unique environment.

c.	The Government envisions a procurement of SLM software, support and training that will occur during 2008.  Acquisition of supporting hardware and integration with the SLM software will occur following award.  In order to validate that the proposed solution can scale to support the HPCMP’s needs, a limited Capability Demonstration by each offeror is planned as part of a proposal evaluation process.  Details of the Capability Demonstration may be found in Exhibit 2.  Please note that the Capability Demonstration will focus on performance characteristics of a proposed solution, and will not address all aspects of the required system functionality.

An information briefing will be offered to interested vendors.  The briefing is scheduled for the morning of June 23, 2008 beginning at 10:00AM EDT and will be followed by vendor-specific one-on-one information exchange meetings and question and answer sessions individually scheduled for the afternoon of June 23 to host all interested vendors.  Each vendor will be allowed 30 minutes for a one-on-one session.  

Please provide any comments addressing the above items as well as any other information that might be of value in formulating the architecture of this acquisition to Ms. Deborah Joeckel at deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov and Mr. Eddie Mills at eddie.mills@gsa.gov by COB June 30, 2008.  Comments and questions may be submitted to GSA at any time during this Request for Information.

Mamakos,W.NASA, College Park; -Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, IEEE Journal of, Publication Date: May-June2007, Volume: 13, Issue: 3, On page(s): 511-536 The purpose of this RFI is to solicit specific capability information fromindustry/aerospace on diode-pumped short-pulse Nd:YAG laser suppliers for capabilityassessment. The goal of this RFI is to insure that the best and widest possible set ofcapabilities is considered for the ICESat-II mission. It is anticipated that NASA GSFCwill proceed with a future funding opportunity to assist in the design, development andproduction of the ICESat-II laser transmitters, but this RFI in no way constitutes acommitment of future funding opportunities from NASA. Interested organizations are invited to submit to the NASA point of contact listed belowa description of their diode-pumped short-pulse Nd:YAG laser technical andresource/facility capabilities relevant to air and space applications. This submittalshould also describe the organizations experience and past performance in the areas ofair and space-based laser systems. We are specifically interested in the following areas:1) Diode-pumped short-pulse Nd: YAG laser design that would a) meet or exceed theperformance requirements given in Table I (will be uploaded as modification to this RFI)and b) be at a state of development that would enable production of a engineering testunit (ETU) for laboratory laser/electro-optic parametric conformance testing andlong-term (preferably accelerated) reliability testing. The engineering test unit (ETU)should be designed to flight-qualifiable standards but would not need to be flightqualified. 2)Diode-pumped short-pulse Nd:YAG laser manufacturing quantities produced per year forair and space applications (minimum quantities of each type of diode-pumped short-pulseNd:YAG laser are encouraged if exact numbers are considered proprietary) 3)Production methodologies, quality control and standards (e.g. Mil-specs, Telcordia,Six-sigma etc.) employed in the manufacturing process for diode-pumped short-pulse Nd:YAGlasers 4)Facilities development and facility capability for manufacturing of diode-pumpedshort-pulse Nd:YAG lasers 5)Laser component (e.g. pump laser diodes, damage testing of optical coatings, lasercrystal development etc.) development and testing facilities and experience. 6) Environmental testing (e.g. vibration, long-term reliability, temperature cycling, andaccelerated life-tests, vacuum) of air and/or space-based diode-pumped short-pulse Nd:YAG lasers, laser components and laser qualification experience and past qualification. 7) Previous and recent prototype, breadboard, brassboard, engineering model and flightmodel diode-pumped short-pulse Nd: YAG lasers hardware for air and space applications. Capability Statements should include an executive summary, not to exceed two pages, toaddress any major items that the organization wishes to highlight. As part of itsassessment of industry capabilities, the NASA-GSFC may contact respondents to thisRequest For Information, if clarifications or further information is needed. Capability Statements shall be submitted to the point of contact listed below and must bereceived by: Monday, June 30, 2008 no later than 5 PM EST Statements may be submitted electronically via email, by fax, or by regular mail, to: Dr. Michael A.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on availability of jet fuel additive packaging, dispensing and storage technology for static dissipater additive, fuel system icing inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor/ lubricity improver, and +100. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The system should be Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for receiving, dispensing and storing additives.  Locations for use of these technologies would be at DoD sites within the Continental United States (CONUS).  We are currently exploring the possibility of additizing jet fuel at the skin of the aircraft.  We need the capability to receive additives in bulk, min-tote, drum and can.  We also need the ability to transfer the additives from container to truck mounted reservoirs with as little handling as possible.  We need the ability to prevent incorrect dispensing by utilizing either varying sizes of dispensing mechanisms which will only allow one additive to be dispensed into a particular reservoir.  We are interested in storage modes, tanks, couplers, nitrogen blankets, containment, hoses, sampling ports, and any other technology required to receive, store, and dispense jet fuel additives.

No Solicitation currently exists, therefore DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  Only serious interested parties are invited to provide commercial market and/or company information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought notice.  Responses should include full company name and address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to conduct the study entitled Potential for Interactions Between Endangered and Candidate Bird Species with Wind Facility Operations on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, described below.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The anticipated period of performance will be three years from the effective date of the contract.  The estimated cost range is between $800,000 and $1,000,000.   The applicable NAICS Code is 541990:  All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This study will provide an initial evaluation of the potential for endangered, threatened, and candidate bird species to interact with offshore wind facilities located along the Atlantic Coast.  The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic coasts have near-term potential for wind power development. Experience from onshore wind development and wind development offshore in Europe suggests that siting of facilities is an important consideration for minimizing impacts to bird species.  Of critical concern is the potential for interaction between these offshore facilities and endangered, threatened, or candidate bird species.  Along the East Coast, the species of concern are the piping plover (Charadrius melodus), roseate tern (Sterna dougallii), and red knot (Calidris canutus).  While these birds are considered shorebirds, there is some question as to whether they may fly over waters on the OCS at distances greater than three nautical miles during migration, or for some species, during commuting flights.  In some locations, Federal waters may occur in areas where land masses would allow for transects across these waters.   Existing information about these species has focused on nesting areas and sitings along the coast.  For the red knot, numerous studies have been conducted concerning their feeding on horseshoe crab larvae.  Little to no information exists as to their migratory flight patterns.  In some coastal locations, the roseate tern may venture far enough offshore during feeding to be impacted by offshore wind facilities.  The key question to be addressed by this study is whether these bird species are at risk from offshore wind facility development.  The determination of risk can be evaluated either through physical observations or through predictive models or a combination.  Equally important is the ability to demonstrate that these birds are not at risk based on a lack of observations (i.e. they are not observed in an area where development would occur) or through predictive models.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The scope of work includes the following tasks.  Task 1: the contractor collects relevant data and information to evaluate the potential areas along the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Coast where interactions between the piping plover, roseate tern, and red knot and potential future wind facilities on the OCS are most likely to occur.  Task 2:  the contractor evaluates existing methodologies for evaluating whether the birds of interest are at risk.  Task 3: the contractor will propose a pilot project(s) specific to a generic location along the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic Coast.  Task 4: within available resources, the contractor will conduct a pilot project(s) to evaluate the proposed study or studies from Task 3.   Task 5, the contractor will synthesize data and information gathered, prepare a final report and, as appropriate, write and submit an article(s) describing the research results to a peer-review journal.  SOURCES SOUGHT-How To Respond: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing one original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) Proposed key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study), with the proposed key personnels qualifications and specific experience, with information on which tasks each key person would perform, qualifications for completing those tasks, and the rationale for that assignment.  (2) Field and analytical facilities and equipment.  (3) Organizational experience.  (4) Specific references including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact, telephone number, and email address for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last three years.  References will be checked.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  Following review of all Capabilities Statements, the Government will establish a list of those organizations deemed most qualified to perform the work.  Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on the following criteria: (A) demonstrated experience and expertise of all key technical personnel including identified Project Manager, especially relating to their knowledge and experience in light of specific tasks to be performed. (B) Demonstration of adequate facilities and equipment to complete the tasks. (C) Demonstrated organizational history of successfully conducting projects of similar size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value; producing high-quality deliverables and completing similar projects on schedule and within budget.  Capabilities of any subcontractors or partners will also be considered.  RESPONSE DATE AND SUBMISSION:  Please send one original and four copies of the Capability Statement to:  Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170-4817, Attn: Debra Bridge, Contracting Officer, no later than Tuesday, July 1, 2008.  Any questions regarding this procurement should be emailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov or faxed to 703-787-1041.  Please include with your question(s) your full name, the RFI number M08PS00084 & title of solicitation, your organization name, complete address, point of contact and phone and fax numbers.

It is not NGA’s intent to preclude companies that express an interest; rather the Bidder’s list will enhance teaming opportunities.  The government intends to issue a draft request for proposal (RFP) after reviewing responses to this RFI.

3.   BACKGROUND

NGA has a significant community of D/HH employees who are vital to supporting the NGA mission.  These employees rely on varying degrees of interpretation support.  Potential offerors should be prepared to propose personnel with the following qualifications:
1.  Personnel must either have Top Secret/SCI clearances or be clearable.
2.  Personnel must have fluency in various modes of sign language and be able to adequately interpret and transliterate between American Sign Language (ASL)/other modes of sign language and English.
3.  Personnel who are willing to travel as there is expected to be some CONUS and OCONUS travel.

NOTE:  NGA is considering the implementation of a Small Business Security Clearance Pilot Program if applicable.  The emphasis is to allow small businesses the opportunity to propose on NGA solicitations at a Top Secret clearance level and provide a limited number of pre-award NGA clearance sponsorship to companies determined to be a viable sources based on their response to this RFI.   This Pilot Program is to assist small business personnel in obtaining a NGA TS/SCI Security Clearance within an approximate 90-day timeframe, enabling cleared personnel to start work upon award or shortly thereafter.  Qualified small businesses must have the required capabilities and technology to support NGA’s interpreting services requirements.

The mission of NGA is to provide timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial intelligence in support of national security.  The mission of the offeror(s) selected for award of any contracts awarded as a result of any RFP subsequest to this RFI is to provide interpreting support to a vital group of NGA employees to facilitate their performance.  
  

4.  ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK

Interpreting tasks are expected to include, but not be limited to, support in the St. Louis, MO area, Arnold, MO, Bethesda, MD, Reston, VA, Ft. Belvoir, VA, Washington, DC, as well as temporary duty assignment (TDY) and deployment assignments support as required.  In addition, the NGA will be relocating East Coast operations to New Campus East by Fort Belvoir between 2010 and 2012.  TDY support may be throughout the United States.  The RFP will include an option for OCONUS TDY travel and deployment assignments which may include hazardous war zone areas.  It is anticipated that a minimum of five (5) Full-time Interpreters and one (1) part-time Interpreter with TOP SECRET//SCI-cleared personnel for the Greater St. Louis, MO area and four (4) Full-time Interpreters and one (1) part-time Interpreter TOP SECRET//SCI-cleared personnel for the Greater Washington, D.C. area meeting the requirements of the SOW and possessing skills will be needed to fulfill NGA requirements.  Intermittent Interpreting support will also be required on an as-needed basis to supplement on-site interpreting support.  The draft SOW is attached. 

Optional effort- NGA has a requirement for TOP SECRET//SCI cleared personnel to provide Computer Aided Real-Time Transcription (CART) Services on a frequent, but intermittent basis for various meetings and trainings in the St. Louis, MO area.  Occasional CART services may be required in the Washington, DC area on a less frequent basis.  (This may be the subject of a separate procurement, the government will make a determination after reviewing RFI responses.)

<DESC><p>The NMFS intends to award a contact (base and 4 option years) to Michael Kandrashoff to act as project field manager and principle sampler in a study of the prevalence of fish with abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system and nearby reference sites. The following reasons are given for this selection. He has spent the past 12 years working on various aspects of the fish abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system. He is familiar with both the St. Lucie estuarine system and the project. He has been serving as project field manager since 1996 on NOAA's St. Lucie Fish Health Project. Mr. Kandrashoff helped NOAA develop a detailed list of the types of externally visible abnormalities that occur in fish in South Florida. Mr. Kandrashoff helped NOAA develop a categorization scheme for these abnormalities that is applied in the field. He has a unique combination of skills that are needed for this project. He is extremely effective in catching fish and has a well trained "search image" for abnormalities. Mr. Kandrashoff can identify the species of the area and can recognize and categorize the full types of abnormalities found in fish of this area. He is thoroughly acquainted with the codes and categorization schemes used to record fish species and the various types of abnormalities used by NOAA in this project. He is familiar with the fish species of this area, their scientific names, their habits and habitats as related to their capture, and the various abnormalities that occur in the fish of this area. He is highly skilled at catching fish on rod and reel. He is well versed in the literature on abnormalities in fish and fish as indicators of environmental quality. He has been trained to collect and preserve skin, fin, and liver tissues for histopathological analyses. He has been working for over 10 years with NOAA in the project, which was extended and expanded with State funding beginning in 2000. Analysis of the database to date has shown distinct relationships between abnormalities and potential sources of variation, including especially species but also year, season, and area. The strong statistical relationships evident in the data attest to the quality of field screening and recording of data. He lives adjacent to the St. Lucie estuarine system and can conduct the project without any expenditure of time and funds for travel. The Government intends to continue the biological sampling component of a multi-year NOAA project being conducted with funding through the State of Florida in the St. Lucie Issue Team Initiative. It is critically important to the success of the multi-year project that collection of data be continued without interruption because missing data points affect the quality of the analysis. It is critically important to the success of the project to maintain continuity in methods and continue the sampling without interruption.
<p>Project objectives are to (1) quantify the most obvious sources of variation in the prevalence of abnormal fish (taxonomic, temporal, spatial, and type of abnormality), (2) standardize an index of prevalence for sources of variation that might confound the ability to discern trends, (3) determine trends over time, (4) compare the St. Lucie estuarine system to nearby reference areas, (5) characterize the abnormalities miscroscopically, (6) examine the relationship of prevalence to potential causal factors, and (7) develop performance measures for use in evaluating biological effects of regional and local restoration projects. The major objective of the field component of the St. Lucie project is to sample the fish of the St. Lucie estuarine system and a reference site to extend a multi-year database and facilitate statistical analyses. A second objective is to acquire tissue samples to allow microscopic analysis of the abnormalities. This announcement relates to maintaining a project field manager to act as project field manager. Duties are described below. .</p>
<p>DESC: The required work will consist of the following:<br />The provider shall act as field project manager and principal sampler and perform the following:<br />(1) sampling fish with rod and reel (and other gear, as required) one full day (8 hr) per week (for a total of 3 sampling days per week) in each of three general areas: the outer St. Lucie estuary, the inner St. Lucie estuary (upstream from Hell's Gate), and Jupiter Inlet. The contractor shall screen the fish for externally visible abnormalities and record the following information for each fish caught: date, station, salinity, temperature, wind observations, observed dredging activity, species, length, number of abnormalities of each type (according to 17 recognized types established in previous work in the St. Lucie system), number of lesions by size for 3 size categories (&lt;5 mm, 5-10 mm, and &gt;10 mm), radius in 2 dimensions and extent of elevation or depression of the 3 largest skin lesions, proportion of the fin lost to fin erosion, and a narrative description of abnormalities, particularly with respect to the fin affected (i.e., pectoral, pelvic, caudal, anal) and position on the body (i.e., left or right side, dorsal or ventral of the lateral line or on it, and forward, mid, or rear part of the body).<br />(2)The contractor shall assign to each abnormal fish a unique identifier in the form of a code that indicates capture date, capture location (station), species, and number. Fish should be numbered as they are caught. For representative samples (no more than 600), the contractor shall obtain samples of abnormal tissue and organ tissue, label (with unique identifier code) and ship the material as specifically instructed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The contractor shall enter the data from each sampling trip into a database (Quattro Pro), with a separate data file for each month and main region (i.e., outer St. Lucie, inner St. Lucie, Jupiter Inlet), and provide the three data files to NOAA/NMFS each month.<br />(3)The contractor shall manage and coordinate a volunteer reporting program with charter-boat guides and recreational fishers. The contractor shall show the volunteers how to screen fish for externally visible abnormalities, how to recognize the 17 major categories of abnormalities seen in the St. Lucie system, how to record the data in the field, and how to enter the data in a database. Where necessary, the contractor shall provide the data entry. These data shall be maintained separately from the data acquired directly by the contractor to avoid loss of reliability in the contractor's data. Data obtained from each volunteer shall be identified with the name of the volunteer in each record. The contractor shall maintain regular contact with the volunteers to ensure consistency and timely acquisition of data. <br />(4)The contractor shall provide the motorized boat, fuel, bait, gear, and ice required for sampling.<br />(5)The contractor shall provide a freezer and maintain special samples in the freezer as required by the COTR.</p>

<a href="mailto:wes.burnett@us.army.mil">Western Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>A.  General Information<BR><BR>Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Chlorhexidine Alcohol Prep Products for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  Standardization for this product line represents a previously standardized product line initiative for this Region. It expired 11/07.  This product line includes a full line of Chlorhexidine Alcohol Prep Products, as detailed in the Technical Criteria below, Usage Items. <BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 10/08.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.      Products & Performance Required <BR>The Northwest Region is seeking Chlorhexidine Alcohol Prep Products. The product category includes applicators and solutions in various concentrations & sizes.<BR>Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $50,293 This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>APPLICATOR FREPP CHLORAPREP 1.5ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR FREPP CHLORAPREP 1.5ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR CHLORAPREP ONE STEP 3ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR SEPP CHLORAPREP 0.67ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR CHLORAPREP ONE STEP 10.5ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR CHLORAPREP ONE STEP 10.5ML LF<BR>APPLICATOR CHLORAPREP 26ML WITH TINT<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.      Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.       Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company           criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide a full range of Chlorhexidine Alcohol Prep Products.  At a minimum, vendors must carry Chlorhexidine Alcohol Prep Products. The product category includes applicators and solutions in various concentrations & sizes. Note: A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>a.  Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (please provide DAPA number).  <BR>b.  Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>c.  Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. <BR><BR>3.  The Vendor has a delivery network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet regional demand history in a timely manner.  <BR><BR>4.  Vendor representation must be sufficient to provide product implementation services and customer servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please answer Yes/ No and provide contact information (name, address, phone, email) <BR>for your representative(s). <BR><BR>5.  Your company must provide staff training for this product line.  Please state how your company will meet this requirement. <BR><BR>6.  Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.<BR><BR>7.  Provide the following information for your prep agents: shelf-life, storage requirements and any restricted use for any specific surgical procedures/skin condition and/or specific age group. (Short shelf life and or special storage and handling requirements are undesirable and may therefore make certain products unacceptable).<BR><BR>8.  Due to the large number of personnel in training status in our facilities, we require clear and explicit instructions regarding safe use of prep agent products as included on product packaging to include recommended coverage rate, (e.g. x inches by x inches per ml) of product.  Please provide a copy of instructions for use included on your companys product packages for the following types of prep agents:  Chlorhexidine Gluconate.<BR><BR>1.	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  the CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a clinical, patient care setting. <BR> <BR>2.	The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>a.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. (DO NOT SEND UNTIL REQUESTED)<BR>b.	Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c.	All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e.	Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR>3.	The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>Applicator with Chlorhexidine Gluconate/ Isopropyl Alcohol solution in the following volumes:<BR><BR>1-5 ML  :  Quantity (20 each)<BR>8-15 ML:  Quantity (20 each)<BR>25-30 ML:  Quantity (20 each)<BR><BR>4.	The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place on at least 5 patients in a clinical patient care setting.  <BR><BR>5.	The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>6.	The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  All criteria will be evaluated on at least 5 patients in a patient care setting, in order to evaluate each criterion:    <BR><BR>1.  Use of the product following manufacturer recommended prep and dry times facilitated an efficient surgical site prep time.<BR>     a. Each manufacturer is required, in their user instructions, to recommend prep contact and dry times for their products.  These times maximize product efficacy.  If application, contact and or dry time in a clinical setting is too long, time spent in the OR can increase leading to increased risk of surgical and anesthetic complications.<BR>b.	 Evaluator will assess the whether actual prep contact and dry times for the products allow for efficient surgical site prep time. <BR><BR>2.  Consistency and odor of product is clinically acceptable.<BR>     a.   Patients undergoing surgery can be sensitive to odors increasing their potential for nausea.  Consistency must be considered because a too thick product will not spread effectively on the patients skin and a too thin product can drip and pool underneath the patient and increase the risk of a chemical burn.<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess odor (not strong or noxious smell) and that product does not run or drip during application to surgical site <BR><BR>3.  Skin is without adverse effects after using product.<BR>     a.   Hypersensitivity to prepping products may cause adverse skin outcomes (rashes, redness/irritation)<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin for redness/irritation following use of product on patients skin.  <BR><BR>4.  Use of the product allows for easy differentiation between prepped and unprepped skin.<BR>     a.   Some product tints are difficult to visually distinguish on the skin of people of all ethnicities.  Draping over unprepped skin would increase the risk of postoperative infection from skin flora contaminating the surgical field.<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin following prep to determine whether prepped and unprepped skin is clearly delineated prior to draping the patient.  <BR><BR>5.  Use of the product does not obscure pre-operative surgical markings.  <BR>     a.  Marking of the surgical site identifies the correct operative site.  If the prepping product obscures the pre-op marking the potential for a wrong site surgery is increased.<BR>     b.  Evaluator will assess surgical site to ensure that pre-op surgical markings are still visible following the prepping procedure.  <BR><BR>6.  Use of the product facilitates surgical drape adhesion throughout the operative period<BR>      a. Products must dry quickly and completely so that drapes adhere to the prepped surgical site.  Inadvertent shifting of drapes during the surgical procedure could result in contamination of the surgical field.  <BR>b.   Evaluator will assess whether drapes shift during the surgical procedure<BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.1 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>A.  General Information<BR><BR>Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Iodophor Alcohol Prep Products for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  Standardization for this product line represents a previously standardized product line initiative for this Region. It expired 11/07.  This product line includes a full line of Iodophor Alcohol Prep Products, as detailed in the Technical Criteria below, Usage Items. <BR><BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 10/08.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.      Products & Performance Required <BR>The Northwest Region is seeking Iodophor Alcohol Prep Products. The product category includes applicators and solutions in various concentrations & sizes.<BR>Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $27,506 This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>SOLUTION SURGICAL DURAPREP 26ML APPLICTR<BR>SOLUTION PREVAIL SURG PREP<BR>PREVAIL-FX ONE-STEP TPCL PREP<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR><BR>C.      Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.       Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company           criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide a full range of Iodophor Alcohol Prep Products.  At a minimum, vendors must carry Iodophor Alcohol Prep Products. The product category includes applicators and solutions in various concentrations & sizes. Note: A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>a.  Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (please provide DAPA number).  <BR>b.  Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>c.  Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. <BR><BR>3.  The Vendor has a delivery network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet regional demand history in a timely manner.  <BR><BR>4.  Vendor representation must be sufficient to provide product implementation services and customer servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please answer Yes/ No and provide contact information (name, address, phone, email) <BR>for your representative(s). <BR><BR>5.  Your company must provide staff training for this product line.  Please state how your company will meet this requirement. <BR><BR>6.  Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.<BR><BR>7.  Provide the following information for your prep agents: shelf-life, storage requirements and any restricted use for any specific surgical procedures/skin condition and/or specific age group. (Short shelf life and or <BR>special storage and handling requirements are undesirable and may therefore make certain products unacceptable).<BR><BR>8.  Due to the large number of personnel in training status in our facilities, we require clear and explicit instructions regarding safe use of prep agent products as included on product packaging to include recommended coverage rate, (e.g. x inches by x inches per ml) of product.  Please provide a copy of instructions for use included on your companys product packages for the following types of prep agents:  Iodophor Alcohol.<BR><BR>1.	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  the CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a clinical, patient care setting. <BR> <BR>2.	The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>a.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. (DO NOT SEND UNTIL REQUESTED)<BR>b.	Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c.	All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e.	Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR><BR>3.	The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>Applicator with Iodophor Alcohol solution in the following volumes:<BR>   1-5 ML  :  Quantity (20 each)<BR>   8-15 ML:  Quantity (20 each)<BR>   25-30 ML:  Quantity (20 each)<BR><BR>4.	The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place on at least 5 patients in a clinical patient care setting.  <BR><BR>5.	The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>6.	The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  All criteria will be evaluated on at least 5 patients in a patient care setting, in order to evaluate each criterion:    <BR><BR>1.  Use of the product following manufacturer recommended prep and dry times facilitated an efficient surgical site prep time.<BR>     a. Each manufacturer is required, in their user instructions, to recommend prep contact and dry times for their products.  These times maximize product efficacy.  If application, contact and or dry time in a clinical setting is too long, time spent in the OR can increase leading to increased risk of surgical and anesthetic complications.<BR>b.	 Evaluator will assess the whether actual prep contact and dry times for the products allow for efficient surgical site prep time. <BR><BR>2.  Consistency and odor of product is clinically acceptable.<BR>     a.   Patients undergoing surgery can be sensitive to odors increasing their potential for nausea.  Consistency must be considered because a too thick product will not spread effectively on the patients skin and a too thin product can drip and pool underneath the patient and increase the risk of a chemical burn.<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess odor (not strong or noxious smell) and that product does not run or drip during application to surgical site <BR><BR>3.  Skin is without adverse effects after using product.<BR>     a.   Hypersensitivity to prepping products may cause adverse skin outcomes (rashes, redness/irritation)<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin for redness/irritation following use of product on patients skin.  <BR><BR>4.  Use of the product allows for easy differentiation between prepped and unprepped skin.<BR>     a.   Some product tints are difficult to visually distinguish on the skin of people of all ethnicities.  Draping over unprepped skin would increase the risk of postoperative infection from skin flora contaminating the surgical field.<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin following prep to determine whether prepped and unprepped skin is clearly delineated prior to draping the patient.  <BR><BR>5.  Use of the product does not obscure pre-operative surgical markings.  <BR>     a.  Marking of the surgical site identifies the correct operative site.  If the prepping product obscures the pre-op marking the potential for a wrong site surgery is increased.<BR>     b.  Evaluator will assess surgical site to ensure that pre-op surgical markings are still visible following the prepping procedure.  <BR><BR>6.  Use of the product facilitates surgical drape adhesion throughout the operative period<BR>      a. Products must dry quickly and completely so that drapes adhere to the prepped surgical site.  Inadvertent shifting of drapes during the surgical procedure could result in contamination of the surgical field.  <BR>b.   Evaluator will assess whether drapes shift during the surgical procedure<BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.1 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR>

<DESC>BACKGROUND: 
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates four HC-144A aircraft.  The HC-144A is manufactured by EADS CASA in Seville, Spain and procured under the authority of the aviation program management office USCG Commandant (CG-931) through the USCG Integrated Deepwater System acquisition program. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft.  End state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets.  The projected average flight hours for the HC-144A operational aircraft are 800 – 1,000 hours annually.  The following is a projected number of operational USCG aircraft for the next five-year period: 
Fiscal Year	FY 2009	FY 2010	FY 2011	FY 2012	FY 2013
Projected No. of Aircraft	05	07	12	14	16

These aircraft are operated in support the Coast Guard Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, as well as surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, which is differently from general aviation.  USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt–laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Aircraft and its components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG’s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  
SYNOPSIS:
The U.S. Coast Guard (CG) is seeking information from potential sources that can provide repair services for the Coast Guard HC-144A Command, Control, Communications, Computers Sensor Acquisition System (C4SAS) components.  
The USCG’s objectives are: 
To obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center or equivalent to effectively test, troubleshoot, clean, repair, and/or modify C4SAS components to the most current configuration and have them returned to service for CG operational use, in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition.  
To have all HC-144A C4SAS components, repaired/overhauled for returned to service with FAA Form 8130-3, other FAA authorized airworthiness form, or Certificate of Conformance attached.
To have all HC-144A C4SAS components, repaired/overhauled to meet OEM’s specifications IAW the OEM’s Component Maintenance Manuals, Service Bulletins, Modifications, and Specifications.  (The USCG cannot provide any of these data or documents to potential sources.)
To track and document flight time, calendar time, flight cycles, landings, and all work performed on HC-144A C4SAS components undergoing repair/overhaul as required under USCG ACMS.  This is accomplished via a Component Repair Record (CRR) which is used by the CG to update the Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) and to maintain the integrity OEM restoration intervals and life cycle limits as applicable to the HC-144A C4SAS.  
To obtain and observe at least two levels of repair services for HC-144A C4SAS components.  The USCG anticipates at least two levels of service and contractors may propose additional levels, as such for separate incorporation of service bulletins, completion of modifications, the breakout of major components, etc.  At a minimum, these two levels of service, “Minor Repair,” and “Major Repair,” must be addressed.    
REPLIES:
All interested parties should respond in writing to John Sugimoto, HC-144A Division, c/o Commanding Officer (144), USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, phone: 252-384-7305, FAX: 252-384-7309, e-mail address (John.T.Sugimoto@uscg.mil).

It has been determined that the Datex Ohmeda Aestiva S/5 Anesthesia Machine is the only anesthesia delivery unit capable of meeting this requirement of the Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, NC due to the need for standardization of equipment.  It has been determined that Datex-Ohmeda is the only manufacturer capable of meeting this requirement.  Anesthesia machines from Datex-Ohmeda are currently in use in the Operating Rooms of Womack Army Medical Center.  In order to maintain a safe environment for the patient, Womack is standardizing this critical medical equipment which is extremely important.  Anesthesia is a critical part of any surgical procedure and uniformity in the operation of the anesthesia equipment is important.  Other anesthesia machines on the market utilize a different anesthesia delivery system.  Therefore, the acquisition of a non Datex-Ohmeda machine would require extensive training for all the anesthesia providers and/or technicians.  Changing practice patterns to accommodate different anesthesia delivery systems would impose an unnecessary burden on the clinical staff and could potentially jeopardize patient care.  In addition, since all machines would be the same, the same repair parts can be used for all machines thereby reducing cost to the customer.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is
section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act as implemented by FAR 13.501, using the test program for commercial items.The applicable NAICS Code is 423450 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This notice is for informational purposes only; NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED as a result of this announcement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information in response to this notice via email to the address listed below, no later than June 17, 2008 at 3:00 PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed contract is entirely in the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by June 17, 2008 at 3:00 PM EST, a sole source contract with Datex Ohmeda will be pursued.

<DESC>The current Federal Telecommunications System 2001 (FTS2001) Long Distance Crossover Contract with AT&T Corporation (GS00T01AHD0002) will expire at midnight on February 27, 2009.  This notice is to advise that the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, for continued performance for a 16-month period beginning February 28, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010. The estimated dollar value is $166M.  This contract is authorized under FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source, and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements).  The incumbent is in place, operational and able to provide the services during this interim period with full system implementation without interruption and degradation.  The agency cannot perform its mission during this interim period nor can it tolerate the disruption to its customer agencies.  The interim period encompasses the time needed for agencies to complete the fair opportunity process under the Networx Program, and the period required to complete any transition from FTS2001 to Networx.  The contract is necessary to allow sufficient time to implement transition and phase out the existing contract.  This is not a formal solicitation.  The Government does not require individual acknowledgement by potential respondents.

<DESC>Notice Type: Notice of Intent to Sole SourceSolicitation:	VA-101-08-RP-0207Set Aside:  N/AClassification:  D- Information Technology servicesLocation:  NationwideNAICS:  	541513 Computer Facilities Management ServicesSynopsis:The purpose of this notice is to provide the Contracting Community with knowledge of the Government's intent to sole source the procurement described herein in accordance with the statutory authority described herein to Hewlett Packard Corporation (HP), 6600 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 28817.  The contract is anticipated for award by October 1, 2008.  The contract length will be for no more than 5 years (1 base year and 4 one-year options).  The scope of the contract will include maintenance and support services for the legacy operational environment currently running the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) in VA facilities across the nation.   This legacy environment primarily consists of HP's proprietary Alpha servers running HP's proprietary Open Virtual Memory System (OpenVMS) operating system.  These mission critical systems provide storage and access for electronic medical records for all patients treated at VA medical facilities. Operational anomalies and downtime of these systems are life-threatening situations as timely access to mission critical electronic medical records directly impacts patient care. Access to HP engineering support for both Alpha hardware and OpenVMS are critical for operational stability and for quick restoration of failed systems.  Both the Alpha servers and the OpenVMS operating system are proprietary products from HP thereby making HP the only contractor with the specialized workforce and system documentation needed to provide the required services for these products.  The required services include engineering support and engineering changes to the Alpha processors, OpenVMS operating system, and continuity of operation services, without voiding warrantee and the operational integrity of these systems.  HP has most recently been performing these services under the VistA Maintenance and Expertise Center (VMEC) contract V101(93)P-2120 awarded in 2003. HP is the only vendor with the necessary expertise and experience to provide the required services without presenting the Government with unacceptable risk, delays and duplicative costs.   Through market research, the Government was not able to identify suitable sources that possess the ability to make engineering changes to both the Alpha hardware and OpenVMS operating system without voiding the warrantee and license provisions of both products.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements'. Per FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  The Government intends to issue a request for proposal to HP without further notice. The estimated cumulative value of VistA Maintenance is $250,000,000.     All inquiries regarding the information herein shall be directed to Jeff Bishop Contracting Officer, via email at Jeff.Bishop@va.gov.VA may include an optional line item for VistA Imaging maintenance and support services as part of this requirement.  VistA Imaging is not document scanning.  Its features incorporate and exceed the functionalities/capabilities of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS).  VistA Imaging is a complex environment dedicated to capture, management, storage, and display of diagnostic quality medical images with image capture occurring directly from medical devices. To date, these services have been sourced from HP through the VMEC contract. VA will soon be issuing a separate announcement seeking qualified sources for provision of the VistA Imaging maintenance and support.  These services include mission critical maintenance and support of dedicated servers, storage, display devices, integrated software, and configuration tuning for the FDA certified VistA Imaging application and the FDA certified VistA Imaging configurations in VA facilities across the nation.  VistA Imaging presently integrates over 150 different medical imaging modalities with the VistA health information system. Ability to support, integrate and configure the interfaces for all of these modalities will be required in order to qualify as a viable source.   If no qualified sources are identified, VA will exercise the option for VistA Imaging maintenance and support services included in this contract.  The estimated cumulative value of VistA Imaging is $75,000,000. Furthermore, VA recognizes the current operational environment of Alpha servers and OpenVMS greatly limit the Government's ability to seek competition as well as take advantage of many market trends.  To remedy this limitation, VA is actively developing a statement of work titled Veterans Information Technology Acquisition for Lifecycle Solution (VITALS).  The VITALS requirement may be competed in a full and open manner with its primary objective being provision, maintenance, and support of an open operational environment that is expected to ultimately replace the current VistA environment of Alpha servers running OpenVMS.   A final determination of the acquisition strategy for VITALS has not been made; no further information is available regarding VITALS at this time.Contracting Office Address: Department of Veterans AffairsIT Acquisition Center 1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX  78772Place of Performance: NationwidePrimary Point of Contact Jeff BishopContracting OfficerJeff.Bishop@Va.Gov

Incumbent frequently will be part of selection committees for the open and competitive procurement of technical assistance.</p>
<p>11. As an internationally recognized strategic information expert, incumbent works independently to provide technical consultation on SI program activities of ongoing or proposed public health programs funded by PEPFAR. Incumbent has the discretion to plan and adjust not only own work, but also the work of others related to the delivery of quality SI services in Cote d'Ivoire. Incumbent discusses development of SI technical services activites, including designing technical indicators and collection instruments, interpreting results, and making recommendations for program improvement, with senior staff of appropriate ministries and other SI partners throughout the country.

<p>14. Incumbent has the authority to develop and adjust long-range strategic plans with senior-level ministry officials, and to counsel and guide them in the setting of priorities necessary to make substantive changes in thinking related to the delivery of SI services, particularly as it relates to developing a nationwide health management information system. This is a long-term effort that will require the formulation of detailed proposals for the development of a national SI policy and the development and dissemination of technical and administrative guidance documents. Incumbent is central to this effort and will be required to monitor and evaluate progress, to make adjustments of project impact and outcome, and to carefully document the results.</p>
<p>15. Incumbent provides highly technical and strategic advice to PEPFAR colleagues, relevant ministries, and implementing partners related to the development and monitoring of SI systems for management tracking, supervision and evaluation of PEPFAR program progress.

<p>For PEPFAR Executive Team and CDC Country Director:<br />16. Provides advice on Strategic Information and monitoring, informatics, and SI systems training requirements; on improvement of program quality through development of SI protocols, procedure manuals and quality assurance instruments; and, on identification of consultants for specific SI program activities.</p>
<p>For other PEPFAR partners<br />17. Reports to the TWG on the progress and outcomes of SI program data and information and makes suggestions to ensure a highly effective integrated approach. Since SI is a crosscutting area for all prevention, care and treatment programs, data this program collects and analyzes will show the effectiveness of program interventions, such as referral systems to other services offered by other programs. Advice and recommendations are made in order to improve overall program quality as well as effective supervision and quality assurance.</p>
<p>For subordinates and colleagues:<br />18. Provides advice and recommendations on improving SI program quality, including training, implementing and monitoring field activities. As an example, provides advice and suggestions, when finding out from monitoring and quality assurance (Q/A) visits that provincial staff do not understand the importance of accurately collecting, collating, analyzing and presenting program data in a way that will assist them to identify problems, and from there negotiates and suggests solutions to ensure a high quality program.</p>
<p>For national and international organizations:<br />19. As the nationally recognized expert on SI systems, provides recommendations on the development of state-of-the-art methods and practices. Major decisions related to SI program changes will be on the basis of advice, counsel and guidance provided by incumbent.</p>
<p>20. Incumbent's technical support on SI aspects of prevention, care and treatment projects, as well as his/her provision of valuable information needed for improvement of program implementation, has a high level of impact on PEPFAR and CDC activities in Cote d'Ivoire. For example, incumbent works with the Prevention, Care and Treatment, and Strategic Information technical working groups to assure that effective program indicators for laboratory testing and training requirements are incorporated into their programs.</p>
<p>21. Incumbent's activities have a significant impact on the formulation and delivery of SI services within Cote d'Ivoire. The need for directional change in the delivery of SI services requires an individual with strong persuasive skills who is recognized and respected for hi/her professional skills in SI systems development. The potential change to be brought about by the incumbent in this position could potentially affect the delivery of SI services for decades. This, in turn, affects the ability of programs that depend on SI results to be strengthened.</p>

<DESC>AE Scope of Work - Surgery Renovation and ExpansionWork will provide two new O.R.s designed for orthopedic and other major surgery along with associated support rooms.  The new O.R.s are to be built next to existing changing room and onto roof area above lab (approximately 2000 sf).  The new space will require new HVAC units to support the new O.R.s designed per VA standards with 100% outside air through HEPA filters and all necessary temperature and humidity control.  Any necessary structural work to support the new space will be included.  Project will renovate existing space occupied by two smaller O.R.s for additional recovery beds and will provide necessary outpatient surgery support space.  The project will be designed so that it can be constructed in phases (separate projects) of approximately $750,000 each.  The AE will meet with Surgery staff and develop initial space plan and cost estimate (15% submission).  Additional submissions will be at 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  Work inside the surgical area will require detailed dust control and work coordination in order to not disrupt ongoing surgery.  The A.E. will use VA design guides, details, and specifications.  The AE will provide four sets of documents at each submission including a cost estimate and will provide a set of AutoCAD drawings and specs in Microsoft Word at the final submission.  The AE will provide 15 sets of drawings and specifications for procurement.

The following DLAD provisions are hereby added in full text:

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests (Sep 1999)
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.

DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (Jun 2001)
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is May 23, 2008 @ 1:00PM local time.

This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a Multi-ChannelSwitched Plasma Power Supply.Background:The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has requirements for a high frequency switchedelectrical power supplies and controller. The equipment will be used in noise controlresearch funded by the Supersonics Project of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program inNASAs Aeronautics Directorate.  Fundamental research into methods of flow control havedeveloped an actuator which uses several small, rapidly pulsed electrical discharges toprovide local perturbation of a jet shear layer to control the turbulence in the jet. Thepurpose of the equipment being procured is to drive a much larger number of these plasmadischarges in a precisely prescribed manner to reduce the noise of the jet and at a scalemuch larger than has been attempted previously. The power supplies will be attached toelectrodes arranged around the lip of a jet nozzle and be precisely controlled to providean array of plasma arcs which will be controlled in different spatial and temporalpatterns to modify the jet flow and noise. The power supplies shall drive 64 plasma arcsof variable duration and frequency between electrodes roughly 3mm apart in atmosphericconditions. The electrical output of the 64 power supply channels shall be individuallycontrolled for voltage, burst frequency, duration (duty cycle), and phase from thecontroller. During the output portion of the output cycle, the output voltage shall bemodulated at radio frequencies (RF), and typically requires a period of peak voltage toinitiate the plasma arc, followed by a quasi-steady-state lower voltage period tomaintain the arc. Diagrams of an example expected signal output are given for reference(see attachment).Specifications:Specifications of the pulse burst repetition rate, RF frequencies, initiation andquasi-steady-state voltages, overall power outputs, and other details shall be thefollowing:1.	64 independently controlled channels2.	Each channel can be controlled for voltage, burst frequency, duration and phase.3.	Output voltage is RF;4.	RF conversion frequency: 1-2 MHz;5.	Output voltage: 10-20 kV (breakdown mode), 500-1000 V (quasi-steady-state mode);6.	Output power during the burst: 100-150 W / channel;7.	Pulse burst repetition rate: 0.1-50 kHz;8.	Duty cycle: 5-25% with minimum pulse duration of 3 s or less over the frequencyrange;9.	Minimum efficiency (power coupled to load / input power): 70%;10.	Power input form: 208 VAC;11.	Control system to remotely control signal parameters and initiate and stopoutput;12.	External high voltage transformers may be placed near actuator electrodes, cablelength between main unit and transformers at least 10 ft;13.	System is enclosed and all enclosures are grounded.14.

<p>Name Brand Justification for RM Young Wind Monitors Replacement Parts</p>
<p>&bull; The RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are the standard wind monitoring sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment. <br />&bull; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. <br />&bull; These RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.<br />&bull; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor. <br />&bull; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.<br />&bull; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required. <br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor. <br />&bull; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.<br />&bull; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty.</p>

<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>0001. Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) requires the contractor to produce an institutional repository system to meet the requirements as stated in the following description.</p>
<p>OPTIONS:</p>
<p>0002. Year 1 technical support only.<br />0003. Year 2 technical support only.<br />0004. Import 1600 legacy publication records from EPrints database. To be done after original development in 2009.<br />0005. Import 1600 legacy publication records from EndNote format. To be done after original development in 2009.<br />0006. Import 600 legacy publication records from tab delimited file. To be done after original development in 2009.<br />0007. Import 3200 legacy publication records from tab delimited file. To be done after original development 2009.<br />0008. Forty hours of additional developer time to address development issues found to be outside the scope of these requirements. To be done after original development in 2009.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />SCOPE OR MISSION:<br />This project will create a searchable public repository of the peer reviewed literature produced by ESRL. This repository will consist of an internal repository for the entry and maintenance of records from which records intended for the public will be synced to a public repository on a separate network. The internal repository will be customized to support ESRL publications metadata and editing workflows. Software must meet ESRL IT network and security requirements, and run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5.0 or better.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />ESRL currently uses a number of different systems to track and maintain information about the publications produced at ESRL. This process is labor intensive and the records created do not contain standard metadata. These records are collected annually and published to the web through a manual process which provides only the most basic search capability.</p>
<p>ESRL seeks to create a system to provide a public, web-based interface to search and list ESRL peer-reviewed publications information, to provide an internal repository for gray literature inside the lab, and to produce ESRL-wide citation statistics for data calls. This system should provide an efficient interface for staff to enter, edit and maintain standard publications information. It should provide workflow for quality controlling the publicly accessible information. It must also meet ESRL IT system, network and security standards.</p>
<p>WORK TO BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>ESRL requires the contractor produce an institutional repository system to meet the following requirements.</p>
<p>System Requirements<br />The system must be based on EPrints repository software, an open source package, and run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system version 5.0 or greater. This system will be developed and tested at the contractor's facility. The final product will be transferred to ESRL via digital media or ftp for installation by ESRL on ESRL equipment. The contractor will have no access to ESRL networks.</p>
<p>The system will be implemented as two repositories. A repository located on an internal network will provide a staff interface for records entry, maintenance and editing workflows. Records intended for the public will be synced from the internal repository to a read-only, public repository located on a separate public network. Non-public data such as full text copies must not be replicated to public repository unless explicitly flagged. Repository builds will include configuration for branding, metadata, citation styles, and browse views.</p>
<p>User accounts will be created from the NOAA LDAP directory and used to authenticate users on the internal server. Transmission of user passwords will be secured using SSL. User accounts will be used as an authority list for author/editor name entry. Scripts will be used to update user accounts from NEMS on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Contractor will document procedures for conducting system updates and patching, backups and system restoration from backups to be implemented by ESRL.</p>
<p>Records Entry and Management Workflows<br />The contractor will develop extensions to the repository software to provide the following workflows.</p>
<p>Researchers will authenticate to the internal repository via LDAP to enter their publication information either from a doi service, xml record or by manual entry. Records entered in the internal repository will require no additional editorial control. Researchers will be able to update any record which they entered, or on which they are listed as an author. Researchers will flag a record as "published" to submit it to the Editor for inclusion in the public database. Further editing by the researcher will not be allowed for records flagged "published". A browse by author view will allow researchers to generate a listing of their citations included in the database.</p>
<p>Editors for each division will authenticate to the internal repository via LDAP to enter and maintain publications information, and quality control citation data once a researcher has submitted a record as "published". This quality control process includes the option to flag the record for replication onto the public server. Editors will receive email notification of published records when any of the authors is from their Division. Editors will also be able to bulk process published citations. Editors will be able to edit any of the records in the database matching their editorial scope. Divisions will occasionally add or change Editors, so the role and responsibilities should be shareable or transferable.</p>
<p>ESRL Publications Metadata<br />The repositories will support standard ESRL mandatory and optional metadata for the publication types, book, book chapter, journal article, conference proceeding and report. ESRL metadata standard is available at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/publications/metadata.pdf.<br />Records will include a "published" flag to be set by the Researcher to indicate to the Editor that a record is ready to finalized, a "public" flag to be set by the Editor to indicate that a record should be pushed to the public server, and a per-document flag to be set by the Editor to indicate whether each file attached to a record should also be pushed to the public server with the record.</p>
<p>The ESRL publication metadata standard includes 5 record status levels, submitted, accepted, published, web publication and unpublished. Each of these records a date for that status. Each item does not need to exist in each of these states, just the date the record the achieved that state. The submission/editing workflow will include a field for each of the 5 dates.</p>
<p>Entry of author information for records must allow ESRL authors to be explicitly associated with their division or laboratory and staff type.</p>
<p>Internal Interface<br />The internal interface will allow ESRL researchers and editors to search and update the full database. This server will include gray literature and full text versions that are not available to the public. It will provide the following capabilities: <br />&#61607; Allow ESRL researchers to search all published internal data and receive email notifications on new publications and search results.<br />&#61607; Browse all citations by date, author and division.<br />&#61607; Search forms to generate lists for standard publications metrics: <br />o number and listing of peer-reviewed publications per year, <br />o number and listing of peer-reviewed publications per year for each Division, <br />o number and listing of publication per fiscal year (month part of publication date will be required), and<br />o listing of citations in submitted, in-press and published status.<br />&#61607; Export search results into AGU citation format for integration with text editors.<br />&#61607; AGU will be the default citation format, http://www.agu.org/pubs/AuthorRefSheet.pdf. An export option to generate a list of AMS citations should be provided, http://www.ametsoc.org/pubs/authorsguide/pdf_vs/agbrf2002.pdf.</p>
<p>Public Interface<br />The public interface will allow the public to search citation information. Features will include:<br />&#61607; Web-based search of abstracts and citation metadata.<br />&#61607; Full text search of available full text documents.<br />&#61607; Citation listings must highlight ESRL authors in bold to identify the NOAA authors. See for example: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/search/pubs/pubs2006.html. The system will use the division or laboratory affiliation data entered by the Researcher/Editor to determine which authors are NOAA affiliated. <br />&#61607; Browse citations by indexes such as date and Division.<br />&#61607; AGU will be the default citation format. An export option to generate a list of AMS citations will be provided.<br />&#61607; Receive notification of new publications by rss.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES:</p>
<p>&#61607; An EPrints software repository will be hosted by the contractor for development, and testing of the development in progress.<br />&#61607; Contractor will present the following development phases for acceptance: <br />o LDAP authentication,<br />o researcher and editor workflows which allows for required controls,<br />o workflow to input multiple author affiliation,<br />o custom formatting to highlight ESRL authors,<br />o export search results in AMS formatting, and<br />o synchronization of public repository data.<br />&#61607; Contractor will transfer final software for internal and external repository builds to ESRL via digital media or ftp and provide technical support for the installation on ESRL servers.<br />&#61607; Contractor will document procedures for conducting system updates and patching, backups and system restoration from backups to be implemented by ESRL.<br />&#61607; Contractor will provide 1 year of technical support service.</p>
<p>&#61607; ESRL will provide temporary account access to the NOAA LDAP directory service for authentication development and testing.<br />&#61607; ESRL will provide server hardware, OS licenses and SSL certificates for internal installation and conduct the internal installation.</p>

<DESC>The Department of State is seeking proposals from GSA Schedule 70 contractors for software development services for the Department of State (hereafter referred to as the State Department or DoS).  State issued a Request for Information (RFI - CVSRFI1044A) in February 2008 and provided a draft solicitation for Industry comment.   A Pre-Solicitation Industry Day was conducted on March 26, 2008 to further clarify the request for quotation and answer Industry Questions.  Based in part on information provided by Industry during the RFI comment period, State revised the draft RFQ and issued it as the Request For Quotation (RFQ) SAQMMA08Q0215 attached to this notice.  The RFQ calls for the procurement of services from GSA Schedule 70 contractors holding NAICS Code 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services.  Background: DoS currently employs the use of four primary software systems to support non-immigrant and immigrant visa processing domestically as well as at overseas Posts.  Due to a number of pressing software, business, and management challenges related to these existing visa systems, the Department is pursuing the consolidation of the capabilities found in the existing set of systems to develop a unified visa processing software solution (henceforth referred to as the Consolidated Visa System (CVS) or System).  The Department’s goal with this System is to address the functional, operational, and financial implications of conducting training and maintenance for four separate primary visa systems as well as to strategically transform and modernize State’s visa processing environment by providing consolidated, person-centric visa data.  Proposals addressing this RFQ are due by noon on July 10, 2008.  All questions regarding the RFQ may be submitted by sending an e-mail to the AQM (State Office of Acquisition Management) POC no later than June 24, 2008.  No questions received after that date will be answered unless the Government determines the answer to the question imparts information material to Industry’s ability to respond to the RFQ.  Government responses to questions will be made available.  The CVS RFQ SAQMMA08Q0215 has been posted via http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  In order to access technical drawings, system documentation, and relevant standards of the systems and development processes, interested contractors must request a CD containing the materials from the AQM POC listed. The CDs may be picked up at State’s AQM Office in Arlington, VA.  Contact Information: If you have any questions regarding this RFQ notice, please contact: STEWARTJ@state.gov via email only.  No telephone questions will be accepted.  All questions shall be in writing addressed to the above email address.  Jo-Ann Stewart, Contract Specialist, and Phone: 703-875-6646, Fax: 703-875-6085.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09 and DFARS Change Notice 20020730.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511 and small business size standard is $23.0 Million.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), is charged with managing all ONR Headquarters and Field Site Information Technology (IT) support for approximately 2,250 users.  The Office of the CIO is responsible for the design, development and maintenance of the headquarters and remote site information technology (IT) hardware and software access systems, telecommunications and wireless capabilities to support ONR mission objectives.  In addition, within the CIO is the Command Business Office (CBO), responsible for the continuous improvement of all ONR business processes aimed at increasing efficiencies and reducing the administrative workload and reducing operational and business costs.  The Office of the CIO has the responsibility for managing, tracking and accountability of all ONR and ONR field sites IT, including but not limited to legacy and Navy/Marine Corps Internet (NMCI) (laptops, software, components, accessories, licenses and the service maintenance agreements), telephone both wireless (national and international Blackberries) and desk hardware, and  phone lines.  Accountability and tracking of deliverable, assets, billings/invoices and contracts compliance is a complex and significant problem requiring a great deal on manpower to audit and reconcile all transactions.  In order to provide continuous business process improvement and accountability for the services, supplies, and deliverables of all Information Technology/Information Assurance (IT/IA) contracts, ONR/CIO is pursuing opportunities to develop solutions that will aide in managing complex IT hardware, software, maintenance service, and licenses contracts with governance in a timely manner.  The CIO wishes to conduct a pilot project to demonstrate a capability to ensure the controlled procurement, deployment, support and transparency of IT assets and services supplied to the ONR (and to the Navy), to ensuring ‘audit-readiness’ associated with procurement and contract compliance of these complex service contracts. The project will need to demonstrate the capability to ensure the controlled procurement, deployment, support and transparency of IT assets and services supplied to the ONR (and to the Navy), thus ensuring ‘audit-readiness’ associated with procurement and contract compliance of these complex service contracts..  The contractor will be required to identify and validate processes and capabilities required to institutionalize “best practice” discipline for governing complex service contracts.  The contractor shall be able to demonstrate an automated solution that will significantly enhance the accountability, visibility, and compliant with acquisition and lifecycle of IT assets and services.  Specifically:  (1) identify the Critical Success Factors (CSF) for a successful deployment and take-up of a Contract Execution Management solution within ONR; (2) align core processes and define key roles required for sustainability of the Contract Execution Management solution throughout ONR; (3) development of a targeted project timeline; (4) implement an automation platform to demonstrate the viability and extensibility of the Contract Execution Management solution for ONR CIO; (5) design a full systems deployment topology and pilot configuration, data flow, and loading processes and source data in order to target data mapping; (6)  validate data source and create source to target matrix to digitize contract terms and business rules as required; (7) build custom reports by the establishment of Single Point of Truth (SPOT) for the verification of data load source files; and (8) conduct an pilot findings and recommendations session.  The contractor will be required to provide a Contract Execution Management (CEM) software platform to capture, codify, and integrate selected IT asset and service attributes; integrate selected contract terms and conditions; and consolidate enterprise data sources that are generated throughout the procurement cycle.  This pilot project will last for approximately four (4) months and end with the Pilot and Assessment Review.  An additional two (2) months will be required so that the Government can perform its own test and evaluation.  The contractor will be required to make any necessary modifications to meet Government standards and IT configurations.  The Pilot and Assessment Review will be conducted to provide a final review of the findings and recommendations for ONR process improvements.  The pilot project will need to demonstrate the capability to ensure the controlled procurement, deployment, support and transparency of IT assets and services supplied to the ONR (and to the Navy), thus ensuring ‘audit-readiness’ associated with procurement and contract compliance of these complex service contracts.  The contractor is required to provide an automated solution that will (1) provide an auditable track of contracted deliverables to ensure the proper receipt, control, and disposal and ensure terms stated in the contract are complete; (2) assist in tracking invoices and billings for products and services to the contract; (3) assist in billing, invoice, reconciliation, and clarify the complexity of invoices and disputes; (4) track asset location throughout the asset lifecycle; and (5) assist in identifying assets and services which are functionally incompatible and ineffective.  The contractor shall provide a configured CEM software for six (6) months of limited use as a working pilot CEM Solution that will demonstrate the capability to align the terms and conditions of supplier contracts with the assets and services procured and utilized, including (1) reporting format/templates that will show the status of all transactions; (2) a “drill down” transactional reporting system which highlights performance, by subject, at any hierarchical level, to conduct “root cause” analysis by department, supplier, product, spend, and rate; (3) an  Contract Execution Management Strategy and Plan, including but not limited to an Organizational Assessment that will identify areas for process improvements, opportunities for cultural change, potential system enhancements within an acquisition environment; and (4) conduct the pilot, findings, and recommendations review session that will provide the final version of the pilot; and (5) provide the final  Assessment and Recommendations document and close project (formal sign-off - acceptance of deliverables).  The Government intends to competitively award a Firm Fixed Price contract (FFP) contract that represent the best value to the Government in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this solicitation.  The Government estimate for this effort is $100,000.00, although lower and higher proposals will be considered.  The period of performance will be from the award of the purchase order through six (6) months thereafter.  The application and submission process consists of full proposals, evaluation of proposals, and oral presentations.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>Based on previous awards, the Walla Walla District Corp has estimated (based on a one person crew) the time required to unassemble a standard 8 foot by 8 foot cubicle, move it to another floor and reassemble the cubicle system requires 4  to 5 hours approximately to accomplish in a professional manner.  A quote that comes in significantly under this in time may be considered non-responsive.  The quote provided under the sample scenario will be the basis for the time allowed for a standard cubicle to be relocated after award of the contract.  Any non-standard cubicle work will be prorated based on difficulty against the cost provided in the sample scenario by the successful offeror.  If more than one person is performing the work, the hourly rate provided under schedule B will need to reflect all workers performing the work.<BR><BR>Work under the purchase order will not allow man-hour time for commuting to the job site.  <BR>Local competition is expected and all work hours start from the job site which is the headquarters building in Walla Walla for the District Corps of Engineers.  <BR><BR>The electrical systems are under another contract and not involved in the cubicle set ups under this solicitation.  <BR>

<DESC>Amendment 1 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE)

The purpose of Amendment 1 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) is to make the following changes:

1.  Page 4, Part One, Overview information, change the Industry Day date from 13 June 2008 to 24 June 2008 and the PROPOSAL DUE DATE from 14 July 2008 to 28 July 2008. 

2.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1, entitled “Applications”, third sentence is changed to read as follows: 

The system must support a minimum of twenty (20) simultaneous 384 kbps video streams, as well as voice and data applications, peer-to-peer applications (e.g. CHAT), situational awareness, e.g. using FALCON View, and network management for aggregate per link data rates ranging from 6.5 Mbps up to 100 Mbps.”

3.  Page 15, Section 1.1.7 Option 1 and Option 2 is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.7 Option 1 and Option 2: MAINGATE Limited User Testing
The baseline program will result in a MAINGATE node system that leads to LUTs by US and Allied Experimental Forces.  This option, if exercised, provides for a large-scale engineering evaluation of MAINGATE in a fielded environment.  The evaluation will assess MAINGATE’s ability to enable new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) designed for the networked maneuver and dismounted forces.  Under the Option 1 and Option 2, the proposer shall provide a quantity of 1,000 MAINGATE nodes at the recurring production unit cost target (sell price to the government) of $60K (FY08$) per unit. Specific tasking and costs related to this event will include training, installation, testing, technical support, etc.

4.  Page 22, Section 4.3.2.2 Volume II, Cost Proposal, subparagraph 7, first paragraph, 4th sentence is changed to read as follows:

There shall be a single master WO element structure (at a minimum of 4 level) utilized for the Prime and IWO transfers as well as Subcontractors.    

5.  Page 25, Section 4.4.1, change the proposal date from 14 July 2008 to 28 July 2008.

6.  Page 30, Section 6.2.1 is replaced in its entirety with the following:

6.2.1 Security

The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under this BAA will be unclassified.   The program may involve Type 1 COMSEC material, and prime contractors must have a Facility Clearance at the Secret level for safeguarding and storage of Type 1 COMSEC material.  Prime contractors who propose work by subcontractors without an FCL and the work involves Type 1 COMSEC, the Prime Contractor must be required to sponsor the subcontractors for an FCL (be advised that the FCL process may take up to 180 days to complete).

<DESC>This market survey advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.1
BACKGROUND
Cultural change is at the core of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) ability to transform to a performance based organization.  The ATO has successfully implemented organizational changes at Headquarters, conducted a major consolidation of ATO support managers and staff regional office personnel to three Service Area Offices from nine locations, and is currently reengineering Service Center functions.  Cultural change initiatives in the last few years have focused on executive coaching, horizontal integration issues between service units and fostering effective leadership teams at the Service Area and the VP levels.  Several large communications outreach initiatives have been undertaken and cascaded throughout the organization.  These efforts were led by managers with the goal of educating, providing opportunities for dialogue, and providing mechanisms for upward feedback.  These communication sessions reached 1/3 of the workforce and focused on the compelling need for change, the direction and principles of the ATO, the plans in place to move the organization forward to a more customer-focused, results-oriented, and performance based culture.  Participants were engaged in discussions regarding cultural and behavioral shifts necessary in their facility/office to move the organization forward toward organizational goals.
A new ATO Chief Operating Officer has been selected.  He supports the changes that have occurred already and wants to further the progress the ATO has made.  He is interested in getting the ATO to operate as "One-ATO" both horizontally across service units and from the Vice President level down to the controller and technician level.  We are looking for support from the top of the organization with the Executive Council down to Front Line Managers in the field.  The effectiveness of leadership teams is always critical to organizational success and while we have made headways in the last few years in this regard, the restructuring also caused barriers.  It will be critical to get the Executive Leadership Team executing strategically and building the Service Area Leadership Council (The field Leadership Directors) to lead operations and execute well.
In the past, we have had executive coaching for all key executive VPs and Directors.  The coaching process needs to be up-leveled to include a very tangible and structured model for change and accountability to occur.  Employee surveys, site visits, manager feedback and interviews with the ATO's most senior leaders has revealed a reluctance to embrace the necessary changes because of learned behaviors and conditioned responses to the issues that arise in the organization.  A key requirement will be specialized training in executive coaching and a clear coaching model that influences change and can be measured.
PURPOSE
To meet the goal of transforming the ATO to a performance based organization, it is recognized that senior leaders need to understand the culture within the ATO, the desired behaviors that will complement the realignment currently underway, any anticipated obstacles, and model the corporate executive leadership and decision making that is needed from senior managers.
SCOPE OF WORK AND CAPABILITIES
FAA requires a skilled vendor to help us transform the culture of the FAA to a results-oriented, customer focused, and performance based organization.  This vendor will be required to work at every level of the organization and have the knowledge, training, skills and background to do large scale cultural transformation work.
A major requirement for this vendor is to have the specialized training credentials in executive coaching and building high performance teams.  The vendor not only has to have the training credentials of a professional executive coach but also the demonstrated ability to affect change and a clear and structured coaching model.  The vendor needs to have a high level of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational behavior and show examples of large scale cultural transformation initiatives they undertook and the positive results for the organization.
	Vendor will review documentation on FAA's strategic plans and objectives, including Mission, Vision, Values and Flight Plan, Strategic Management Plan (SMP), Business Goals, and Performance Objectives.	Vendor will review the ATO's employee perception survey (University of Maryland conducted in 2004) to understand the survey instrument and analyze the survey results.	Vendor will conduct interviews to gain an understanding of organizational issues.  Potentially interviews may be done with the senior leadership team to gain a solid understanding of the current situation with respect to each leader him/herself as well as opportunities and challenges each leader sees in the senior leader group working together to achieve successful culture change.  Focus groups may be used as well.	Vendor may also choose to conduct a series of interviews to assess the current environment, opportunities and needs at more operational levels.  Included will be interview with selected headquarters staff, interviews with three Service Area Directors and focus groups with mid level managers and individual contributors in those three Service Areas.	Vendor will provide one-on-one executive coaching with each member of the Executive Council.  This coaching will use a model that builds in accountability and has some sort of metric for improvement attached to it.	Vendor will recommend activities that have been specifically designed to accelerate the FAA culture change effort and produce measurable results in the most expeditious way possible.	Vendor will support on-call consultation to promote the FAA's expedited implementation of the cultural change recommendations.
The vendor will:  
	Develop a survey and assessment tool to measure organizational progress in becoming performance based.  Provide analysis and useable reports as a mechanism to leverage change.  Provide progress on agreed upon metrics and design and implement needed interventions to close gaps.	Deliver a recommended strategy for cultural change transformation.  This strategy should assist the agency in modeling, reinforcing and aligning critical leadership behaviors necessary for a cultural shift.  While this list is not inclusive, these change leadership behaviors are deemed critical to ATO success:a. Teaming:  Cooperates and collaborates with others across organizational boundaries.b. Achieving Results:  Produced measurable results, is accountable and adds value to the ATO.c. Influencing Others:  Takes risks, challenges and inspires others to move to new ATO behaviors.d. Valuing Others:  Listens, empowers, recognizes and rewards otherse. Flexibility:  Seeks feedback and makes changes in behavior 	Provide a plan for executive coaching that focuses on organizational outcomes, utilizes and communicates a clear coaching model, and increases measures of accountability for desired leadership behaviors.  The coaching model should include the participant's manager in the action planning process.	Design and deliver training to varied audiences depending on skill gasps.  Vendor needs to be experienced in training methods and delivery and effective in gaining performance based results.  Vendor will provide own printing and participant materials for any training conducted.	Support the Change Management Team in developing initiatives that move metrics in the areas of "building a performance based culture" and "improving relationships between managers and employees"

<DESC><h1>SYNOPSIS MODIFICATION</h1> --The purpose of this synopsis modification is to answer vendor questions and amend the solicitation, where necessary, to provide corrections and clarifications.  A conforming copy of Section L and M are attached that incorporate all of the changes made since the solicitation was first issued.<br><br>

--- <h2>QUESTION 31:</h2>  Do our subcontractors need to be small businesses?
<br><br>

--- ANSWER 31:  Per the “Agreement” in the Solicitation H.7 clause entitled Small Business Set-Aside, which reads in part “A small business concern submitting an offer in its own name shall furnish, in performing the contract, only end items manufactured or produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas,” a small business set-aside requires manufactured end items to be supplied by small businesses.  The size standard for the subcontractors is the same as for the prime contractor.  For this solicitation under NAICS 339943 --- Marking Device Manufacturing, a business is considered small if it has 500 or fewer employees.  In this case the firm that manufactures the completed label would need to be a small business but the firm that furnishes the raw materials, i.e., steel, aluminum, vinyl, adhesive, etc., would not have to be a small business.  <br><br><br>


--- <h2>QUESTION 32:</h2>  The Government has received additional questions and concerns regarding label delivery.  The following answer is provided to address these questions and concerns.
<br><br>

--- ANSWER 32:  The solicitation Section C, Paragraph 7.2.1.11 entitled Delivery Times sets forth the Government’s delivery expectations by stating “Processing and delivery expectations are organized under a three tiered schedule.”  The expectations identified in the three tiered schedule were further clarified in synopsis Modification 8.  The Government recognizes that industry practice, shipping schedules, overseas shipping complications, and other factors may affect shipping.  For this reason, the requirement is stated as an EXPECTATION and not a firm requirement.  Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals that address these expectations and offer the best possible solution.  Solutions should be supported by data that substantiates the feasibility and realism of the proposed solution.  <br><br> 

Deliveries are FOB Destination as provide by the clause entitled F.O.B. Destination (NOV 1991)( FAR 52.247-34), which is incorporated by reference in Solicitation clause F.1.  The contract does allow for shipping delays that are beyond the control of the contractor.  Additionally, offerors are reminded that this is a performance based contract and that simply confirming compliance with Government expectations does not relieve the Contractor from meeting those expectations during contract performance.  If the Contractor fails to provide the value of goods or services required by the contract, the Government will expect to receive consideration from the Contractor. <br><br>

The following changes are made to the solicitation Section F, L, and M to ensure consistency between the delivery provisions and to set forth the method of evaluating proposals regarding offered delivery solutions.  <br><br><br>

Make the following change to Section F – Deliveries or Performance --<br><br>

The second sentence of the solicitation clause F.3.1, IUID Data Labels (as amended) currently reads as follows: “The IUID Data Label delivery times shall fall within the delivery tiers shown in paragraph 7.2.1.11.”  This sentence shall be changed to the following: “IUID Data Labels shall be delivered F.O.B. destination.  The IUID Data Label delivery times shall comply with the Contractor’s proposed and accepted delivery solution, which shall be incorporated into this contract at the time of award.  If the Contractor does not provide a delivery solution, the IUID Data Label delivery times shall fall within the delivery tiers shown in Section C, Paragraph 7.2.1.11.   <br>End of Paragraph <br><br><br>

Delete paragraph L.3.7.d. – Production & Delivery Capability, and replace it with the following paragraph. --<br><br>

d. – Production & Delivery Capability: The proposal shall specifically state the offeror’s production and delivery capability for each type of data label material.  In other words, the offeror should provide a matrix showing how many data labels of each type can be delivered on a repetitive basis in the turn-around times set forth in the PWS (Paragraph 7.2.1.11).   As an alternative, the offeror can propose a production and delivery solution setting forth delivery time alternatives and options based on production and delivery capability, order size, and commercial shipping practices.  The production and delivery solution shall explain to what degree the offeror can meet the delivery expectations of the Government.  Solutions should be supported by data that substantiates the feasibility and realism of the proposed solution.  Note: This information is being requested both for proposal evaluation purposes and so that the Government can established daily IUID Data Label request limitations in the contract as a workflow management tool.  <br>End of Paragraph <br><br><br>  

Delete the solicitation Section M 2 - Step 1 - Evaluation of Technical Capability paragraph entitled SHIPPING STRATEGY and replace it with the following paragraph. --<br><br>

DELIVERY CAPABILITY & SHIPPING STRATEGY:  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed delivery solution to determine the degree to which the contractor can meet the delivery expectations of the Government.  Additionally, the Government will evaluate the degree to which supporting data substantiate the feasibility and realism of the proposed delivery solution.  The Government will evaluate each offeror’s shipping strategy (1) to determine the degree to which the shipping methods can ensure on-time delivery of IUID Data Labels and (2) to determine how well shipping costs can be controlled and kept to a minimum.   <br>End of Paragraph

- All are standard window based dialog boxes.  Open Dialog box is simply a standard open file, waves processing and mil 1553 are basically check boxes.  Edit Top/Bottom ADCP commands simply display a text file for editing in a nice GUI window.
11.  Additionally for the Waves Processing Dialog, when the dialog is called up from the Options menu it talks of the interactions with the Operation, Input, and Output sections of dialog.  There is no mention of what should be available to the user for the Data, ADCP Information and Processing sections.  When the dialog is called up from the Waves menu it speaks of the Data, ADCP Information and Processing sections and there is no mention of the Operation, Input, and Output sections.  Can this information be provided?
-more detailed information will be available after estimation phase.
12.  Is there a language preference (Java, VB, .Net, C++) for the simulation to be developed in?  Does language and development environment contribute to "future upgrades to OEDAS can easily and inexpensively rolled" in section 3.6?  Modular design factors highly into it as well.

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to solicit proposals for the implementation of the USAID/ETHIOPIA Urban Gardens Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children. 

This new Urban Gardens Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children is designed to improve the nutritional status and income of households in Ethiopia, affected by or living with HIV/AIDS, through income generating activities. This activity will focus on services to expand urban garden opportunities for low income HIV/AIDS-affected households, particularly those headed by females and orphans. This program will also provide access to additional services, including health and education, for the Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) beneficiaries in the program.

Through this activity, beneficiaries are expected to acquire the skills and means to enable them to:  increase food production; enhance household food availability; promote consumption of a balanced nutritious diet; improve family income through the sale of food surplus; and realize alternative livelihoods. By building on experience to date, this activity will expand areas where urban garden support for HIV-affected households and OVC are available and increase the number of beneficiaries.  

Five components of this activity are planned: 1) Technical  support in the development of urban gardens; 2) Technical support in accessing health and educational services for OVC; 3) Building the capacity of local Non-Government Organizations; 4) Strengthening referrals and linkages between Food and Income Generation, health, education, and  Care and Treatment services; and 5) Management and Evaluation Information Systems. Implementation is expected to include partnerships with on-going efforts to support OVC, prevention efforts, community-based palliative care and treatment programs, and HIV counseling and testing outreach services. Success accomplishing these activity components is defined as having created additional income-generating opportunities and improved access to health and education services for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and their families. Measurement of that success must be evidence-based.   

USAID/Ethiopia intends to post the Request for Proposals (RFP) on June 20, 2008.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.

<AWARDEE>SG Construction Services LLC
<DESC>The USPS Leased Space Accessibility Program (LSAP) typically consists of small scale handicap improvements to leased facilities throughout states of the mid-west.  Projects are awarded in groups of approximately 30 to general contractors pre-approved by USPS   The buildings are predominantly wood framed structures with masonry or wood constructed bearing wall, with steel framed buildings tending to be located near major metropolitan areas. The improvements typically consist of:

PLUMBING:
Replacement of faucets, drinking fountains, installation of sink waste line insulation, water coolers, and occasionally the construction of a new restroom tying into existing services. 

CARPENTRY:
Modification of custom wood framed customer counters, installation of manufactured customer counters and tables, replacement of doors, closers and hardware, installation of restroom grab bars and occasionally the construction of exterior ramps.  Finish work is limited to repairing adjacent wall and floor finishes.

ELECTRICAL
There are no major upgrades.  Work is limited to capping unused outlets, reconnecting countertop equipment and an occasional new wired outlet.

PAVEMENTS
Work consists of limited replacement of damaged asphalt and concrete pavements, parking striping, installation of non-illuminated pole signs, and the occasional construction of concrete ramps with handrails.
