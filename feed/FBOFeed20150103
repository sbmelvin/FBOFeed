<DESC>The Department of Energy, Procurement Services Division, Acquisitions Office, extended a Task Order by means other than full and open competition.  An approved Limited Source Justification (LSJ) sets forth the justification and approval for extension of a Federal Supply Schedule order on a Limited-Source basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.  Per FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the justification is for a noncompetitive extension of the ManTech Advanced Systems International, Inc. (ManTech) task order, to continue performance of the vital work they currently perform until the GAO Protest is complete and the follow-on contract is in place.  As outlined in the LSJ, no other source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required due to the unique and specialized nature of the services being provided.  The original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures and was not previously issued under sole-source or limited sources procedures.  All Schedule awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.  This justification is in the support of extending the existing award for a period of no more than one year, to ManTech.  The primary basis for this task order is to support the Power Electronics, Material Sciences, and Applied Physics, Systems Engineering, and Manufacturing Technologies services for the SunShot Initiative.  ManTech possesses requisite knowledge of EERE processes and systems, in addition to the requisite scientific, engineering, technical, analytical, management and planning expertise and personnel to successfully assist the Federal staff in accomplishing the mission of EERE SunShot.  The dollar value of this action (including options) is $9,549,792.80.  This special notice is not a solicitation for firms to submit proposals.  The above is the summary of the sole source justification.  To receive copy of the approved LSJ please contact Carrie N. Brown, carrie.brown@hq.doe.gov.
