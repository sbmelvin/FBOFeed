<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will be soliciting offers for a contract(s) to survey trees for detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in conjunction with officials of the State of Illinois.  APHIS is planning to survey trees that are hosts for the ALB for signs of infestation.  The program is necessary to reduce the potential for damage of tress from this major pest.  The Asian longhorned beetle bores into and kills a variety of tree species including f maple, elm, chestnut, birch, poplar, ash, and willow.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency and is committing extensive resources to eliminate this pest and restore the urban forest.  The work will include survey by bucket truck, tree climber, or any other means to thoroughly inspect trees on public and private property as directed.  The Asian longhorned beetle currently infests the following areas in the Chicago area of the State of Illinois:  Chicago, Revenswood, Kilbourn Park, Addison (DuPage County), Summit and All Saints.  APHIS reserves the right to award more than one contract, however, at this time the Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a single contract for the Chicago area.  Firm-fixed price contract(s) will be awarded, covering the period from date of award (approximately on or before January 12, 2004), through September 30, 2004, and will include four unilateral option years.  A post award orientation will be scheduled approximately on or before January 22, 2004. Tree surveyings will begin approximately on February 1, 2004.  SIC Code:  0783; Small Business Size Standard: $5.0 million average annual receipts over three years.  All responsible sources may submit an offer for consideration, however, evaluation preference will be given to responsive and responsible offerors that qualify as Hubzone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or women-owned small businesses, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified for the solicitation.  The solicitation will be released on or about December 15, 2003.  To download a copy of the solicitation, please visit our web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html.  The government intends to provide the solicitation and all amendments via this web site only.  NOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE SENT TO OFFEROR REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF THE SOLICITATION NOR ANY OF ITS AMENDMENTS.  IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THIS WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with MicroTechnologies, Inc. (MTI) to provide services to conduct and report on results of diagnostic testing for Infectious Salmon Anemia virus (ISAV).  The diagnostic tests are to include ISAV-RT-PCR analysis and cell culture isolation for viruses from fish (salmonids and non-salmonids) collected from the wild, netpens, or used in laboratory experimentation, and samples from the environment (seawater, sediment, surfaces of netpens and invertebrates) and may include assays for other pathogens.  Services for field collection of samples from the natural or culture environment are included in the proposed contract.  Archiving of tissues processed for molecular diagnostics may be required.  MTI is a small company in Maine that provides diagnostic services to the Maine and New Brunswick salmon aquaculture industry.  It was the first fish disease diagnostic laboratory in the US to isolate the ISA virus in commercially cultured Atlantic salmon using a cell culture technique modified from the then standard fish health certification protocols.  MTI wrote the fish health inspection protocols for ISAV when it became a >listed pathogen= and has been at the forefront of research and diagnosis on ISAV from when it first appeared in New Brunswick, Canada.  MTI is certified by the USDA-APHIS specifically for ISAV diagnosis and due to MTI=s long history of fish health certifications performed for US and Canadian salmon farms, including those experiencing ISA outbreaks, it is the only laboratory in the US with extensive experience in diagnosing ISAV from non-laboratory settings (i.e., in the aquaculture and natural environments).  This latter point is critical in diagnosing low-level infections which are most likely to be present in wild populations and in non-salmonid carriers.  MTI has extensive experience in diagnosis of various pathogens of fishes and is in a position to collect samples from Maine environments as needed.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by March 25, 2004.    Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture.  Complete Architectural and Engineering (A/E) services are required for the design and construction of a new Federal Courthouse to house the U.S. Courts and Court-related agencies in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The site will be located within the city limits of Harrisburg, PA.  The objectives for this project, include but are not limited to, serving the Government’s needs for functional space in the most efficient and cost effective manner, to provide visual testimony to the dignity and stability of the United States Government, communicate the importance of the federal judiciary’s mission, and create an asset to the community which reinforces the urban planning objectives cultivated by the City of Harrisburg.  The size of the building will be 24,432 gsm (262,970 gsf), including interior parking, and may house eight courtrooms (four District, two Magistrate and two Bankruptcy), as well as other court and court-related functions.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $70 million to $80 million.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Courthouse that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, both site and indoor parking, site development, client program development, socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This building will also include GSA design standards for secure courthouses and U.S. Marshals Service construction and security requirements.  The project will provide a facility that meets energy goals and includes sustainable design and construction practices (LEED). Estimated start date for design is November 1, 2004.  GSA’s CAD Deliverables Policy will be incorporated as a requirement of the awarded contract.   This policy is available from the Contracting Officer upon request.  Alternatively, you may access the CAD Deliverables Policy on the Internet at http://www.gsa.gov/midatlanticcadpolicy .  Graphic submissions, which reflect spatial information, must comply with this policy. Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated into AutoCAD are not acceptable.  Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 format at a minimum.  The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense at the request of the Government.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction.  The Stage I selection will result in a short list of a minimum of three to five lead designers and their firms.  This selection is open to A/E design firms, as defined above, within the United States.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the CBD announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) modified to include only the A/E’s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #3, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the-art Courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment. (3) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.

Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the Stage II project team, A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the hereby-designated general geographical area consisting of the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.

The Selection Board will interview each team at GSA’s Regional office located in Philadelphia, PA.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507 and FAR 52.219-9, large business A/E firms shall be required to provide the maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities to small business concerns and small business concerned owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals (RFPs).  This announcement only constitutes a synopsis of the future release of solicitation number N00019-04-R-0101 for P-3 Special Structural Inspections (SSI), Enhanced Special Structural Inspections (ESSI), SSI-Kits (SSI-K), Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), and Modification/Installation Programs (MIP) required by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).  The solicitation will be made available to interested parties on the NAVAIR website:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm.  This requirement is for efforts consisting of an intensive depot level process for airframe and component inspection, deficiency identification, and correction to ensure safe and reliable operation as well as to enhance the aircraft service life expectancy to sustain inventory levels throughout the service period.  SSI is a detailed inspection to detect fatigue damage in critical outer wing locations.  This requires significant material removal in order to gain access to the structure for inspections.  Material repair/replacement includes the removal and repair/replacement of the outer wing lower forward spar cap.  ESSI includes SSI inspections and is a major preemptive structural repair to the inner and outer wing surfaces, plates, beam, planks and fittings, with inspection and on-condition repair of center wing structure and fuel weep holes.  SSI-K is an ESSI inspection with mandatory material replacement for the outer wing, center wing box and horizontal stabilizer structural components.  PDM is scheduled depot level maintenance requirements to ensure the timely discovery and correction for actual and/or anticipated defects.  MIP efforts include the installation of Government Furnished Equipment and the maintenance, repair, removal, and test of aircraft components, avionics, aircraft structures and associated ground equipment for the USN and FMS customer P-3/S-3 T/M/S aircraft.  It is anticipated that the Government will award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price contract(s) for a base year and four one-year option periods.  Additionally, each year will contain over-and-above contract line items to cover efforts outside the scope of the basic contract requirements.  The Government intends, but does not guarantee, to make one award to a small business and multiple awards under unrestricted competition.  The award to a small business is not a formal set-aside but rather a reserved award.  Furthermore, award to a small business is contingent upon the small business being eligible under the North American Industry Classification System code 336411 and being both technically acceptable and generally evaluated to be in line with all other proposals being considered for award.  The ability of the contractor to meet the following minimum capability requirements shall be the primary focus of the contract(s):  SSI: an induction of 32 aircraft per year and maintain an estimated in-process schedule of 120 days; ESSI: an aircraft induction of 22 aircraft per year and maintain an estimated in-process schedule of 210 days; SSI-K: an aircraft induction of 15 aircraft per year and maintain an estimated in-process schedule of 210 days; PDM: an aircraft induction of 22 aircraft per year and maintain an estimated in-process schedule of 155 days; MIP: an aircraft induction of 60 aircraft per year and maintain an estimated in-process schedule of 210 days.  The above-cited quantities may not accurately reflect the total number of aircraft to be inducted due to concurrent work efforts.

The resulting contract will be a requirements type contract with a base year and five option years.  The estimated number of tests per year is 1.0 million.  SOW.  1.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IMMUNOASSAY TEST REAGENT FOR 6-ACETYLMORPHINE.  1.1.  The materials shall be for the specific immunoassay detection of 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) in urine.  The reagent must be compatible for use with the Hitachi Modular (D and P modules) automated drug screening equipment, and must be applicable without modification of the equipment.  The reagent must be compatible with the optimal throughput of the instrument being used to perform the assay in the military laboratory.  1.2.  Sensitivity and Specificity.  The sensitivity of the reagent must be such that it will accurately detect the presence of 6-AM when present at a concentration of 10 ng/mL in no less than 85% of cases, yet have a specificity such that the number of samples identified as presumptive positive do not adversely impact the GC/MS confirmation section in the number of samples requiring confirmation (GC/MS) analysis as determined by the DoD Drug Testing Laboratories.  The DoD for the initial immunoassay and GC/MS confirmation tests currently uses the following drug cutoffs in urine specimens.  The reagent must not interfere with the other drugs of abuse testing listed below:  Drug/Metabolite; Cutoff in ng/mL, Initial test, GC/MS.  11 Nor delta 9 THC carboxylic acid (THCCOOH), 50, 15; Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine), 150, 100; Opiates (Morphine), 2000, morphine 4000, codeine 2000, 6-AM 10; Phencyclidine (PCP), 25, 25; Amphetamine/Methamphetamine (amphetamines), 500, 500; Designer Amphetamines MDA/MDMA/MDEA, 500, 500; Barbiturates (secobarbital), 200, 200; Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 0.5, 0.2; 2-oxo, 3-hyroxy-LSD, 0.5, 1.0.  1.3.

An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free <7.5ng/ml <10.0 ng/ml cutoff calibrator <12.5 ng/ml <20.0 ng/ml controls.  Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 5% of the number of total specimens. The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in 3. below using this testing protocol.  3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF 6-ACETYL MORPHINE REAGENT.  3.1.  The reagent shall identify specimens containing 6-AM at concentrations equal to or greater than the 10 ng/ml screen cutoff for 6-AM.  The reagent used in the initial assay screen shall correctly identify 95% of the positive and negative control specimens when present at 12.5 ng/mL and 7.5 ng/ml respectively of 6-AM.  The sensitivity of the reagent must be such that it will accurately detect the presence of 6-AM when present at a concentration of 10 ng/mL in no less than 85% of cases, yet have a specificity such that the number of samples identified as presumptive positive do not adversely impact the confirmation (GC/MS) section in the number of samples requiring GC/MS analysis as determined by the DoD Drug Testing Laboratories.  3.2.  The reagent used in the assay of 4 specimen batches containing 20 sequential aliquots at each of the following concentrations per batch (7.5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 12.5ng/ml, and 20.0 ng/ml) must have a percent coefficient of variation of the mean concentration value (%CV) of less than 10%.  3.3.  The coefficient of variation for calibrators and respective controls at the concentrations listed in paragraph 3.2, when distributed throughout a normal laboratory-testing batch, must be less than 10%.  A laboratory batch consists of approximately 100 specimens and controls.  Throughout the batch there must not be significant drift in control values.  3.4.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open 7.5-ng/ml quality control samples must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.5.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open 12.5 ng/ml quality control samples must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.6.  The 6-AM assay reagent shall be checked for cross reactivity to commonly encountered pharmaceuticals or metabolites that may be found in normal urine specimens that might be expected to produce a positive response.  3.7.  The 6-AM assay reagent shall be checked for cross-reactivity to each drug/metabolite listed in 1.2.  The vendor must provide information regarding the extent or concentration of drug at which their reagent will cause a positive screening result. 4.  MANUFACTURER’S QUALITY ASSURANCE PRODUCTION PROCESSES.  4.1.  Adherence to Good Laboratory and Manufacturing Practices, such as ISO-9000 certification, must be documented.  4.1.1.  Quality and authenticity.  All materials used in the preparation of reagents should be verified as to authenticity and purity.  4.1.2.  Stability.  The kit and each kit component must be shown to be stable and at the correct concentration over the period of use of the kit.  Components, which are homogeneous solutions, must not deteriorate throughout the period of use of the kit (from date of preparation to date of expiration).  4.1.3.  Antibody specificity/cross reactivity.  Antibody specificity must be verified for each lot of reagent and provide equivalent sensitivity and specificity to the detection of 6-AM.  4.1.4.  Lot numbers.  Lot numbers must be used to identify reagents and other preparations to allow tracking of all immunoassay components.  Lot numbers should be bar-coded and/or should be compatible for use with the Hitachi Modular (D and P modules) Analyzer System. The procedures used to assign unique lot numbers for each solution or reagent must be clearly recognizable.   A single lot number for a kit will suffice if all materials used in that lot number can be tracked to identify the materials and procedures used in the preparation of that kit.  4.1.5.  Corrective action.  When a specified production lot that has been shipped for distribution or is in use is found to be out of control limits as stated above, the action taken to ensure correction for existing kits (i.e., notification) must be documented and action taken to ensure that the deficiency does not reoccur and all records must be retained.  The Contracting Officer must be notified within 2 working days of any deficiencies in existing kits and of all corrective actions.  The FDA must be notified according to its regulations.  5.  FIRST ARTICLE TEST REQUIREMENTS.  5.1.  Reagent for testing up to 5,000 specimens shall be required for the first article testing and approval.  Testing of reagent will be performed on a pass/fail basis.  To obtain approval, the first article test shall meet the specifications, inclusive of acceptable performance levels, set forth in 1. through 3. above and the manufacturers must meet requirements described in 4. above.  5.2.  The reagent kits provided for First Article Testing shall contain a complete set of manufacturer's procedural instructions for use and calibration of the reagent on the Hitachi Modular (D and P modules) Analyzer System.  5.3.  The testing and evaluation of the kits will be performed by Government personnel at one of the Drug Screening Laboratories specified by the Government.  5.4.  The contractor will be authorized two observers present at the initiation of first article laboratory testing.  Following laboratory testing, the observers will depart the laboratory and technical evaluation personnel will analyze and summarize data. Within 30 calendar days of completion of first article testing, the company will be notified of the results of the testing.  The technical evaluation panel will be established by the Government and will be present during first article testing.  5.5.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Ing. Jorge Rovira, Director, Dirección de Energía Eléctrica, Ministerio de Economia, Alameda Juan Pablo II y Calle Guadalupe, Plan Maestro, Centro de Gobierno Salvador, San Salvador, El Salvador, C.A., Phone:  (503) 231-5615, 281-1122 ext.1306, Fax:  (503) 281-1157, e-mail: jrovira@minec.gob.sv.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the El Salvadoran Ministerio de Economía (MINEC), in the assessment and design of a new national energy policy.

On March 3, 2003, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy Miguel Lacayo wrote to U.S. Ambassador Likins requesting USTDA assistance to help the Government of El Salvador structure a comprehensive energy policy. The objective of this effort was to prepare El Salvador for the increasing energy demand anticipated by the economic and trade development that would result from the entry into force of the Central American Free Trade Agreement currently being negotiated by the U.S. Trade Representative on behalf of the United States. The development of a market-oriented energy policy was expected to prepare the climate for an expansion of the energy sector that would in turn attract new international trade and investment, since large capital-project investors would be able to rely on a stable and market-driven competitive framework.

There has been considerable progress in El Salvador’s move from complete government domination in the energy market to a market-oriented private sector industry. In a country that has no oil or gas production of its own, all of the oil and oil-product import, refining, marketing and sales operations are in private hands, as are all thermal power generation and electricity distribution activities. U.S. companies dominate in both the oil and electricity markets.

In the electric sector, the Government of El Salvador has introduced a market-oriented marginal pricing methodology that selects low-cost generators first in the market-clearing and dispatching process. This is a procedure that has not worked to perfection, and subsequent attempts to adjust the market mechanism have sown confusion among investors. The re-orientation of the electric sector along free-market lines satisfactory to all players is a major objective of the study described here. 

This project has the Government of El Salvador’s highest priority, and it is supported by the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, as well as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. U.S. Government support rests in part on the idea that the establishment of a well-functioning energy market in its own right will improve living conditions throughout El Salvador but, more importantly, the successful implementation of a market-oriented energy sector in El Salvador will go a long way toward regional integration and will be compatible with the Central American Free Trade Agreement now under discussion.

The general objective of this Technical Assistance is to support the GOES in the consolidation of recent electric market reforms in El Salvador.  This will entail guaranteed price stability in the short run, and assured supplies in the long run, as well as general incentives for the long-term development of the electric sector, including distribution and commercialization activities.  The project requires that these reforms be consolidated by means of a new (wholesale and retail) market model, which is to be based on generating costs.  These generating costs will have to be the primary basis for bilateral contracts, along with requisite financial provisions that will guarantee the long-term supply of electricity and the identification and implementation of changes pertaining to the current regulatory environment of the distribution and commercialization sectors.  This means that recent changes in the (electric) sector that are already pointed in that direction will have to be retained, but in such a way as to assure an orderly and efficient transition to the implementation of the new model that is to be developed by this consulting project.  

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: 	Long-term Projection of Energy Demands
Task 2: 	Assess the Development of Energy Sources Over Time
Task 3: 	Assessment of Energy Efficiency Programs
Task 4: 	Develop Environmental Protection Plan
Task 5: 	Develop Plan for Attracting Private Investment
Task 6: 	Report on Energy Policy Harmonization among Central American Countries
Task 7: 	Assess Options for Importing Natural Gas from Mexico
Task 8: 	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $337,235 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm local San Salvador, El Salvador time, April 20, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Humberto Salvo, General Manager, Empresa Nacional de Transmisión Eléctrica, S.A., Pista Juan Pablo II y Avenida Bolívar, Apartado Postal No. LM-143, Managua, Nicaragua, C.A., 
Phone:  505-267-2688, Fax:  505-267-1620, e-mail: hsalvo@entresa.com.ni.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Empresa Nacional de Transmisión Eléctrica, S.A (ENTRESA), for the development of a comprehensive plan for designing and operating an optical transport network to provide a market alternative for the Nicaraguan telecom sector.  

ENTRESA is the state-owned electric transmission company in Nicaragua.  ENTRESA, as part of their power modernization program, is installing new shield wires on their electric transmission towers to protect them from lightning strikes.  ENTRESA’s new shield wires contain 12 to 24 embedded optical fibers and only a single fiber pair is required to control their electrical switching equipment.  The remaining capacity, if made commercially available, would significantly increase Nicaragua’s national bandwidth for telecom and Internet services, would provide Nicaragua with direct access to international networks and should drive telecommunications and Internet prices down.  

The new spare fiber capacity made available in ENTRESA’s shield wire modernization program is a national asset, not only literally since ENTRESA is state-owned, but also figuratively from the standpoint of its potential to provide significant national bandwidth at lower cost as well as direct international connectivity via the Americas Region Caribbean Optical-ring System (ARCOS). Circuit costs should decrease dramatically while reliability is significantly enhanced.  This project should enable significant decreases in the cost of Internet services, leased lines and switched voice, data and multi-media services in Nicaragua, thus accelerating e-Commerce and trade capacity.  It will provide backbone capabilities to support voice, data and multi-media over Internet Protocol (IP) in the future.  It should also allow the country to attract international investors whose factories, laboratories, offices, call centers and facilities require high-speed, reliable and secure telecom services.

While there does exist a high-capacity fiber-optic network on the Caribbean coast, the ARCOS Network, there are no telecommunications facilities available to connect Managua and the heavily populated pacific coast to this capacity (currently dependent upon an inefficient low-capacity microwave network from Costa Rica).  In pursuit of developing this high-value connection, ENTRESA, the national energy transmission company, has budgeted US$3 million to extend fiber-optic cable along their currently existing electric transmission towers around Managua and from Managua to the Caribbean coast.  While the commercial availability of the necessary physical infrastructure presents a significant opportunity to enhance the Nicaraguan telecommunications sector, that in itself is far from sufficient.  The major hurdle in this project development is that ENTRESA has no experience in telecommunications.

The objective of this technical assistance is to 1) assist ENTRESA in the design, development and evaluation of options for an efficient business model (dark-fiber provider; Joint Venture with carrier/operator; “carrier’s carrier structure”, etc.); and 2) development of an investment-quality Business Plan for ENTRESA that addresses the market, network design and financial aspects of the fiber business for whichever commercial model is selected and licensed.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: Perform Market Research and Analysis
Task 2: Assess Telecom Sector Capabilities and Plans
Task 3: Determine Stakeholder Objectives for Commercialization of ENTRESA Fiber-optic 
Capability
Task 4: Evaluate ENTRESA’s Telecom Capabilities
Task 5: Develop Business Model Alternatives for ENTRESA
Task 6: Facilitate the Assessment and Selection of ENTRESA’s Operating Model

TITLE: Knowledge Acquisition Technology and Applications

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 04-06-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; and, FY 07 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 April 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/IFTB is interested in  development of advanced knowledge acquisition tools to allow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to understand knowledge entry, allow knowledge to be collated from different SMEs, and allow knowledge to be validated and maintained in a more simplified and efficient manner than the current state of the art. Achieving advances in this area is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.    The overall objective of this BAA is to develop easy to use knowledge acquisition tools and techniques to allow SMEs to enter their knowledge efficiently into knowledge-based reasoning systems with minimal help from knowledge engineers.   These technologies should enable knowledge-based systems to easily encode SME knowledge to meet the needs of communities in their knowledge system environments. 


II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4,900,000.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $1,000,000; FY 05 - $1,000,000; FY 06 - $1,000,000; FY 07 - $1,000,000 and FY08 - $900,000.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 39 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 to $500,000 per year.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict their white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.

Electronic submission to Peter Rocci (Peter.Rocci@afrl.af.mil) will also be accepted.  

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value -Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding their use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Peter Rocci, telephone: (315) 330-4654 or email Peter.Rocci@afrl.af.mil.  

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, telephone (315) 330-4777 or e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River MD, intends to award a sole source cost type order against Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-03-G-0003 to United Technologies, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) in support of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter Program.  This is the second of a three phase effort to replace the existing MH-60R Halon fire extinguishing system with non-ozone depleting substance, which will shall have the same level of fire extinguishing capacity/efficiency as the current system.  SAC shall provide the preliminary design and analysis necessary to further define the non-Halon aircraft engine and APU Fire Extinguishing system and the aircraft modifications required to implement the candidate system selected in Phase I. This effort will result in the delivery of a risk reduction test article that can be used to accurately simulate an H-60 engine nacelle fire, a non-Halon fire extinguishing system prototype which will be installed in the test article and associated test plans and test data results.  As the sole designer of the MH-60R air vehicle, SAC is the only known source with the knowledge, experience, and data to perform this effort.  To award this contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment, has a requirement to establish a long-term business relationship for the purpose of improving and sustaining military family housing communities at the following installations:  F ort Benning, Georgia; Fort Rucker, Alabama; Fort Gordon, Georgia.  Collectively, these projects are known as the Southeast II Group.  This requirement will be satisfied through the Army Housing privatization program known as the Residential Communities Ini tiative (RCI).  RCI operates as part of the Congressionally authorized Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) (10 USC 2871).  RCI employs best commercial practices in management, development, construction, maintenance and operation to meet the Ar myÃ¢Â€Â™s long-term needs for military family housing.  The Army will award one contract for the Fort Benning project, one contract for Fort Rucker project, and one contract for the Fort Gordon project.  The Army may also include Fort McPherson as a stand- alone project or in combination with another Southeast II project.  The selected offerors will work with the Army to create a Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP) that will describe a 50-year plan to develop, re-develop, construct, maintain and  operate the housing assets at each of the particular Southeast II Group projects.  The Army will solicit this requirement on an unrestricted basis using a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  The Army intends to publish the Southeast II Group RFQ on or abou t March 29, 2004.  At Step One, the RFQ will seek, from interested offerors, a five-page submission addressing three Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs).  The closing date for receipt of MER submissions will be on or about April 12, 2004.  Upon conclusi on of the evaluation of the MERs, those offerors who have satisfied the MERs shall be eligible to further compete for the Southeast II Group by submitting a complete Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).  Offerors will be provided a minimum of 30 calendar day s to provide their SOQ submissions.   The Army recognizes that its RCI solicitations include a Step One selection process that remains fairly constant.  Providing a mechanism to allowing certain previously qualified offerors to avoid submitting duplicative documentation for Step One can enhanc e Offeror and Army efficiency.  Current potential Offerors who have qualified for inclusion in the competitive range in any prior Army RCI solicitation, and whose composition of principal members includes the same principal members (with the same responsib ilities) since inclusion within that competitive range or award, may request a waiver of the requirement to submit MERs and Step One and be automatically eligible to compete on Step Two of this solicitation.  Instructions for requesting a waiver will be pr ovided in the RFQ.  The Army, in its sole discretion, will determine whether the offeror fulfills the waiver requirements.  Offerors not qualifying for a waiver will be asked to submit Step One information in accordance with the RFQ.   The Southeast II Group RFQ and amendments will be available at the Army RCI web page at http://rci.army.mil.  Selecting the Southeast II RFQ button from the Army RCI web page will allow offerors to view and download the RFQ and amendments.  Prospective off erors will be requested to register. Registered offerors will receive electronic notification when amendments are posted to the web page.  The Army will only respond to questions about the RFQ if they are received by electronic or facsimile medium.  The Ar my will not reply to any question submitted later than 10 days prior to a submission deadline.  All comments or questions by e-mail should be directed to tracy.fetchik@usace.army.mil.  If by facsimile, comments or questions should be directed to Tracy Fetc hik at (301) 677-3005.  Army responses to questions will be issued in the form of an amendment to the RFQ and can be found at http://rci .army.mil.

<DESC>NOTE:  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 13, 2004.    

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will be soliciting offers for a contract(s) to survey trees for detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in conjunction with officials of the State of Illinois.  APHIS is planning to survey trees that are hosts for the ALB for signs of infestation.  The program is necessary to reduce the potential for damage of tress from this major pest.  The Asian longhorned beetle bores into and kills a variety of tree species including f maple, elm, chestnut, birch, poplar, ash, and willow.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency and is committing extensive resources to eliminate this pest and restore the urban forest.  The work will include survey by bucket truck, tree climber, or any other means to thoroughly inspect trees on public and private property as directed.  The Asian longhorned beetle currently infests the following areas in the Chicago area of the State of Illinois:  Chicago, Revenswood, Kilbourn Park, Addison (DuPage County), Summit and All Saints.  APHIS reserves the right to award more than one contract, however, at this time the Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a single contract for the Chicago area.  Firm-fixed price contract(s) will be awarded, covering the period from date of award through September 30, 2004, and will include four unilateral option years.  A post award orientation will be scheduled. Tree surveying services will begin on or about March 1, 2004.  SIC Code:  0783; Small Business Size Standard: $5.0 million average annual receipts over three years.  All responsible sources may submit an offer for consideration, however, evaluation preference will be given to responsive and responsible offerors that qualify as Hubzone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or women-owned small businesses, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified for the solicitation.  The solicitation will be released on or about January 13, 2004.  To download a copy of the solicitation, please visit our web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html.

The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting proposals for landscape modification at the Van Nuys – Santa Clarita P&DC in Santa Clarita CA.  The landscaping project will replace a majority of the existing landscaping which consists of lawn and shrubs; and replace them with more drought tolerant plant materials.  Selective removal of existing trees will be required throughout the area.  A majority of the lawn area is to be killed and replanted with a hydroseed mixture.  Groupings of trees, shrubs, and accent boulders will be planted throughout the area.  Plant material in the crib walls is to be sprayed with an herbicide, have the dead vegetation removed, leaving the root structure in place, and hydroseeded.  Ground cover adjacent to the structure will consist of stabilized decomposed granite and plantings of shrubs for contrast.  Modification of the existing irrigation system will be required to provide for the new landscaping.  Postal operations at the facility are 24 hours per day, and access to the facility and parking areas is not to be blocked without prior approval.  The work is to be completed in 120 days after notice to proceed.  Estimated range is $700,000-$900,000.  This is an owned facility.  The proposal must contain the offeror’s overhead, profit, bonds, insurance, and all other contingencies.  No allowance for such items will be made after contract award. The minority subcontracting goal for this contract will be 11%.  Offers will not be publicly opened.  All proposal information will remain confidential until award. This solicitation is being issued pursuant to the authority of the U. S. Postal Service Purchasing Manual, Issue 2 dated 1/31/02.

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN IN FULL EFFECT AND FORCE.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NEC’s outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT – The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT – The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating country’s export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Government’s export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating country’s specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.

<DESC>These are the questions and answers that occurred on the March 12, 2004 Industry day.

Industry Day Questions and Answers

1)	What criteria are you looking for in terms of Quality of Aggregate?

A.	Geologic testing and x years of proven performance or no geologic testing and x + y years of proven performance.  Solicitation will include more detail and time frames.

2)	Is the phasing plan a key issue, due to working around the runway?

A.	Yes.


3)	Is the planned start date an evaluation factor?

A.	The actual planned start date will not be an evaluation factor if the proposal can meet the not to exceed threshold listed in the solicitation.

4)	Can millings be reincorporated?

A.	No.

5)	Is there a stockpile of crushed concrete currently on base?  Is it going to balance out?  Can we use that stockpile?  How much is left?

A.	Yes. Calculations show the project will use less crushed concrete for base material than will be produced through demolition. The existing stockpile is usable, but not a sufficient quantity to complete the project without crushing material generated by this job.

6)	Who will supply the radios that Airfield Management requires for the contractor
to be in contact with the tower during operational hours?  The contractor or the government?

A.	Government.

7)	Is the 40V gate or another gate available to use?  Will privately owned vehicles (POVs) be allowed through that gate or only marked construction vehicles?

A.	A single construction gate will be available and staffed as needed by Security Forces.  All construction traffic for this project will be routed through the construction gate.  Gates will allow direct access to either State Highway 51 (Bruneau Highway) or State Highway 67 (Grandview Highway). Following award, contractor will choose the preferred gate, which will be coordinated with Security Forces for use. 


8)	How will the flow of traffic work at the 40V gate if it is utilized?  That is a one way flow on private property; will there be a two-way flow?

A.	Intent is for one-way loop traffic flow. This has yet to be finalized.


9)	Is the end date defined?

A.	Yes, it will be defined in the solicitation.


10)	In the overruns, is the asphalt milled up to existing base gravel underneath?

A.	Yes.


11)	In the overruns, is it an option to move the thresholds up?

A.	No.


12)	On the taxiways, does the milling and replacement go all the way to the runway?

A.	Yes, and the 200’ clearance line is distinctly marked.


13)	The foreign object debris (FOD) ridden concrete on H will be taken out.  Will it be hauled and crushed?

A.	Yes.

14)	On the portions of the project that require slab jacking, what will be done with the tie down anchors? 

A.	Design Engineer is evaluating and solution will be included with the solicitation.

15)	There are some roads that were utilized previously to access the overruns; will they be available for use on this project?

A.	Yes.



This project repairs existing taxiways and overruns through various methods to include urethane injection slab jacking, mill and overlay of asphalt surfaces, and full-depth concrete replacement.  A relatively small amount of electrical work is also included to install new edge lighting on one connecting taxiway.  Concrete and asphalt products must meet strict guidelines as described in project specifications to include aggregate quality, mix design, quality control testing, batching tolerances, as-placed testing, and final performance.  The approximate breakout of pavement repair methods are 520,000 square feet of asphalt mill and overlay, 150,000 square feet of full depth concrete replacement, and 16,250 square feet of slab jacking. 

The Magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

This contract will be a FFP contract with a NTE 120 days.
The successful contractor will be selected based upon several evaluation factors to include: past performance, mission capability, and cost/price.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest proposed price.  Offerors shall submit proposals that can be accepted solely on the basis of the initial offer as the Government may proceed with award of contract without discussion.  

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 31 Mar 04 using the Government's Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps).  Paper copies are not available.  You must register on the subject site in order to receive notification of changes to the solicitation; however, you may still retrieve the changes without registering.  Note: Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) in order to be eligible for award.  Registration requires a DUNS number.  Registration may take up to three weeks to process.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.

<DESC>MODIFICATION *** This announcement notifies all interested parties of an additional opportunity to provide information to the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) regarding the Sources Sought/Market Research announcement for Reference-Number-SS-2004-01.  If a response has already been submitted to this Sources Sought notice, no other response is needed.  Based on responses already received, NIST intends to issue a solicitation against GSA schedule and award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) resulting from that solicitation.  Any responses received to date from GSA schedule holders will be invited to participate in this solicitation.  Responses to this notice are not required for eligibility to reply to the solicitation.  A determination has not yet been made whether or not to set-aside the solicitation for small businesses.  Our intent is to issue a solicitation by July 1, 2004, with an award by September 30, 2004.  Multiple awards are anticipated.   Requests for other pertinent information may be addressed to the technical point of contact, Janet Brumby, email address is Janet.Brumby@nist.gov.  The contractual point of contact is Romena.Moy@nist.gov. *** ORIGINAL NOTICE *** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking sources with the capabilities to perform in-depth quantitative benefit-cost analyses of individual technology development projects and aggregates of projects funded by the Advanced Technology Program since its inception in 1990. *** Quantitative benefit-cost case studies are a foundation of ATP assessment of project outcomes and impacts in the longer term.  They have become instrumental in NIST-level budget documents and financial reporting as well as ATP reports to various stakeholders.  OMB, in particular, expects to see return on investment results, and has increased its expectations for “retrospective” analyses of benefits actually realized by the program to date, as compared with “prospective” analyses, as time has passed.  The utility of these studies depends on consistency and clarity of analysis and on the communication and presentation of complex concepts and results to a lay audience. *** Addressing the multi-faceted mission of the Advanced Technology Program “to accelerate the development of innovative technologies of broad public benefit undertaken through partnerships with the private sector”, studies will identify and quantify technical accomplishments, quantify private and public benefits and costs, and identify broader, less quantifiable impacts on industrial innovation and societal impact.   State-of-the art analysis techniques are expected to include traditional cash flow analysis directed at private and social rate of return measures and/or other approaches such as macroeconomic modeling, simulation, or econometrics, as appropriate.  Emphasis will be on ATP projects where the period of ATP funding has ended and commercialization has begun. *** Some task orders are anticipated to require a team approach, or a network of experts, encompassing specifically, scientist, economist, and/or financial market expertise.  Others may emphasize development of training modules or convening of workshops to explore issues in benefit-cost analysis techniques applied to early stage technology development projects undertaken by industry with private-public funding. *** Examples of studies currently being considered (not exhaustive) include the following: *** (1) Case studies of a single project, a cluster of similar technologies or applications, or a group of projects under an ATP focused program.  Studies will involve quantitative analysis of benefits and costs from product or process technologies.  Such studies will emphasize projects where the ATP-funded technology development phase is complete, and commercialization has begun.  (2) Case studies of complex projects, such as large joint ventures or groups of related projects involving substantial technology diffusion and potentially impacting multiple industries or multiple segments of a given industry.  Some of these studies are expected to require methodology development for tracing impacts in unanticipated applications and industries and to involve complex ATP attribution issues.  (3) Projects involving modeling of globalization of technology and trade.  Studies are expected to require modeling of economic benefits to U.S. consumers from ATP-funded technologies commercialized abroad.  (4) Workshops devoted to theoretical and practical issues in performing benefit-cost analysis; for example: appropriate use of private v. public v. social measures of return; confidentiality of company information; handling the counterfactual and program attributions; and definition of measures and/or new approaches; and possibilities for use of control groups. *** It is estimated that 1-2 task orders, amounting to $200,000–400,000 will be issued per year, beginning in FY 04. *** Information furnished must not exceed 10 pages and should include background information, contracts both Government and commercial for similar services, and references; i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organization’s capability for ATP to perform a proper evaluation of the capability statement. *** Interested parties shall provide the Government with information as follows: (1) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Company Size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), or Hubzone Small Business); (4) Identify whether you are interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; (5) Identify whether the services identified in the Draft Statement of  Work are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (6) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (7) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based - include the contract number; Government agency name and address; contract funded amount; (8) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; and (9) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel. *** THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. *** Firms interested in performing this requirement may reply to this Sources Sought by addressing the elements above and any processes that would be used. Replies shall be provided in duplicate (one original and one copy).  Proprietary processes or data must be clearly marked and documented as such.  Respondents should include applicable Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Central Contractor Register Number (CCR). The Government will not pay for any materials furnished in response to this synopsis. Submittals furnished will not be returned to sender.  Requests for other pertinent information may be address to Romena Moy at (301) 975-4999. Point of contact e-mail address is Romena.Moy@nist.gov.

<SOLNBR>EDOESE-SASA-2004-01
<RESPDATE>022004
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The United States Department of Education intends to award a purchase order to procure media services to create audiotapes and web casts for the dissemination of information to Local Education Agencies (LEAs).  In the fall of 2003, the U.S. Department of Education began conducting monthly conference calls to State Education Agency (SEA) Title I Directors in an effort to provide them with an opportunity to learn about and respond to complex issues relating to the implementation of No Child Left Behind (NCLB).  The calls have provided a way for Federal officials to explain the details of the Department's non-regulatory guidance documents as well as the Department's expectations for SEAs.  In addition, Title I Directors and other key SEA staff were given the opportunity to ask specific questions of Federal officials in order to gain a clearer understanding of the Department's expectations.  Consequently, feedback from Local Education Agencies' (LEA) staff to the SEA and Federal officials has highlighted the need for LEAs to receive these same opportunities for communication, information sharing and dissemination.  As a result, in January 2004, the Department completed the production of an audiotape and web cast for LEA Title I Directors and officials.  Using two different vehicles for sharing the production with LEA staff, the Department attempted to reach more than 15,000 invited LEAs.  In order to create a regular system and schedule for communicating with LEA staff, this procurement requests the services of a media production company to facilitate communication between the Department and LEAs.  The contractor shall provide media production services that lead to the creation of up to eight audiotapes and web casts to be available during the months of March, April, May, June, September, October, November, and December.  The tasks to be performed under this procurement include the following:   1)	Film/shoot 6 separate productions at ED or another D.C. location.  Videotape 6 productions at ED or another DC location. No taping session to last longer than 4 hours.   Each production shoot must include two crews equipped with two industry standard electronic news gathering (ENG) kits and a minimum of two videographers.  There should be sufficient lighting, mics, and backdrops for four participants.  Matching cameras must shoot in professional Beta or DV formats.  Audio production should meet industry standards with each participant fitted with an individual lavaliere microphone. Crews should have experience in producing multi-camera shoots.  A/B switched field monitor for matching cameras is also required.  The Department will be responsible for inviting LEA staff to participate.  2)	Edit each videotape in order to create at least one 60-minute audiotape and web cast for each of the 6 shoots (and up to a total of 8 all together).  Edit each production, in consultation with ED personnel, to create separate thematic audio-video segments for presentation on the web.  A separate audio file of at least 60 minutes must be created from the same production session.  3)	Encode each videotape for web streaming.  Each production must be encoded for streaming in Real Media Surestream and Windows Intellistream files.  Each file must contain at least three A/V streams ranging from the lowest bandwidth product of 32 kbps to the highest bandwidth product of 236 kbps.  4)	Create an HTML page to host each web cast.  The HTML page must include stills of participants drawn from video; links to the streaming media segments; and whatever other text information or links ED would like to include.  5)	Host each web cast for up to 4 months each. The HTML page must be hosted on a separate http server.  Hosting of streaming media files must be done on a dedicated streaming media server capable of streaming Windows Media or Real Media, utilizing the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  6)	Transcribe each web cast for 508 compliance.  7)	Synchronize each transcription to media.  Words from closed-captioning must synchronize with the speakers per 508 requirements.  8)	Prepare quarterly reports for the Department of Education.  9)	Prepare a final report.  TIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES:  1)	Within 5 days of each editing session, the contractor shall submit to the Department an audio only version of the production.  2)	For each production, within 10 days of each editing session, the contractor shall prepare for the Department the web cast and its transcript, including a link to the streaming media and synchronized close captioning files.  
  3)	The contractor shall submit quarterly reports within 10 calendar days after the end of each quarter.  The reports should summarize the major activities and accomplishments during the reporting period and provide information for each project task regarding significant findings and events, problems encountered, suggested solutions, and staff utilization.  The contractor shall specify in the reports the extent to which the project is on schedule.  4)	The contractor shall submit the final report no later than 30 calendar days after the end date of the award.  The final report should include details on the strengths and weaknesses in executing this procurement.  PROPOSALS:  Offerors will propose between 30-40 days of work.  Proposals must contain:
a) A statement outlining the procedural plan to perform each task (no more than 5 pages total); b) The number of days available to perform the work described in this requirement; c) A statement reflecting the vendor's most recent hourly or daily rate of pay; d) A resume showing relevant qualifications and previous related experience; e) A daily rate and total proposal price.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. Agency financial statements are required by the Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576), which mandates agencies prepare financial statements and subsequent audits of the financial statements. For a sample of financial statements and related reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR intends to issue a subsequent RFI to conduct CFO audits, Statement of Auditing Standards 70/88 Reviews of DoD Service Organizations, Assessment of DoD Financial Management Systems, Audit Readiness Assessments, and Remediation Plans.  Commercial sources may include but are not limited to Independent Public Accounting Firms (IPA’s) and Information Technology (IT) firms.  

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

Reliability Assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems 

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems including related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD’s financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and is a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a cases-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments, in some instances, must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  However, individual task orders with a limited objective may be issued that do not require compliance with GAGAS or the AICPA standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also determine whether the contractor’s work complies with GAGAS and that the work supports the assessment conclusions.  Task order contracts will be issued with variable performance timeframes reflected in each order.  It is envisioned that IPA or IT firms with IG DoD oversight can conduct the reliability assessments. 

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, individually awarded task orders will determine the accuracy and reliability of various DoD Financial Management Systems, including related processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating information systems in terms of fulfillment of purpose, design efficiency, appropriate controls, data integrity, integration with external systems, and human interface.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any work performed with accounting/financial management systems and/or government information systems (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THIS ANNOUCEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY EFFORT EXPENDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE.  

The U. S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is performing “market research” to identify potential contractors to perform IT consulting services.  

USTDA’s current financial management system (FMS) does not interface with its management information system.  USTDA’s current management information system is a custom designed, relational database, client-server application implemented utilizing 4th Dimension.  The custom MIS stores program data and related financial data, some of which is also entered into the FMS.  The current system arrangement, however, results in dual entry of financial data in both systems, which is inefficient for the Agency.

USTDA is considering adopting Oracle Federal Financials 11i as its new financial management system.  At the same time, USTDA is planning to update its current custom MIS with several goals in mind; providing for critical user requirements not meant in the existing custom MIS; eliminating dual entry of data; and avoiding or reducing interfaces between systems.

USTDA must determine the best approach for re-designing the current MIS.  Three development approaches have been identified and are currently being considered:  procuring a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system; building a new MIS; or a combination of these two.  As a result, USTDA is seeking a firm to conduct a study to determine the best approach for achieving the goals stated above for updating the current agency MIS.  This includes identifying and evaluating COTS project management applications that can replace USTDA’s MIS and interface with the Oracle e-business architecture; identifying and evaluating rapid application development (RAD) tools for building a new MIS that would interface with the Oracle e-business architecture; and determining a mixed COTS and custom approach, if any, that would interface with the Oracle e-business architecture.   

The successful contractor shall have experience and expertise in conducting similar evaluations, have experience with Oracle Federal Financials 11i, 4th Dimension, COTS project management applications, and other mainstream RAD tools; be able to determine architecture (including required interfaces), level of effort, cost, requirements gap analysis, management roles and responsibilities, and risk assessment for the above development approaches; be a small business; be on a GSA Federal Supply Schedule for information technology services (Schedule 70, SIN 132-51); and have offices in the Washington, D. C. metropolitan area.  

Any interested firm should submit a capability statement that demonstrates the firm’s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  In the capabilities statement, contractors should identify which of the successful contractor criteria they meet, and provide their business size. Responses should be submitted to contract@tda.gov no later than March 31, 2004. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.    Any information submitted to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary, and shall become the property of the Government.

<SUBJECT>D -- Access to Internet, Internet2 and National Lambda Rail Connectivity Through the Front Range GigaPOP for the Department of Commerce Boulder Campus Organizations
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to negotiate with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), located at 1850 Table Mesa Drive, Boulder, Colorado 80305, for access to Internet, Internet2, and National Lambda Rail (NLR) connectivity to support various missions of the Department of Commerce (DOC) Boulder campus organizations.  BACKGROUND:  The needed connectivity provides a bidirectional path for information to the American Public, other U.S Government organizations, Universities, and the world research community. DOC Boulder organizations continuously move large quantities of data in and out of the campus over several network connections. The average data flow in and out of the DOC Boulder campus is approximately 1 Terabyte per day and growing. The primary users of this information are research partners. These research partners are generally affiliated with universities and are located worldwide.  In order to provide connectivity to all DOC Boulder customers, connections to the commercial Internet, Internet2 and the National Lambda Rail (NLR) are required. DEFINITIONS:   (1) The commercial Internet is the network that is most commonly used by government, corporations, small companies, and individuals. It developed out of the original ARPAnet (or DARPAnet). It is a loose connection of many commercial companies that provide worldwide network interconnection to the general public. (2) The Internet2 is a next generation network that has been built on an advanced backbone that interconnects regional network aggregation points called GigaPOPs. The Internet2 network is a single connection operating at 10G bit/sec. The Internet2 project is being led by a consortium of 205 universities called the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Design (UCAID). A connection to Internet2 can only be acquired through one of the regional GigaPOPs and requires membership in UCAID. An organization connected to Internet2 is only allowed to use the network for research related traffic. All other network traffic must traverse the commercial Internet. Most of the network traffic in and out of the DOC Boulder campus is research related and flows to/from UCAID organizations over Internet2. It would be impossible for many of the DOC Boulder organizations to fulfill their missions without Internet2 connectivity.  (3) The NLR is a private fiber network currently under construction that will connect research organizations in major US cities with 40 optical wavelengths, each operating at 10G bit/sec. The NLR is sometimes referred to as Internet3. The long-term future of information technology in the United States will be based on the technology of the NLR. It is critical to the missions of the NOAA-Boulder organizations that they are connected to the NLR. NLR is another connection that can only be acquired through one of the regional GigaPOPs.  (4)  The regional GigaPOP that provides Commercial Internet, Internet2 and NLR connectivity in the Colorado area is the Front Range GigaPOP (FRGP). The FRGP is a consortium of local Universities, research organizations and government agencies that cooperate to form an aggregation point in order to share Wide Area Networking (WAN) services including commercial Internet, Internet2, NLR and local peering. (Local peering is a byproduct that occurs because of the aggregation point that must be set up to connect all the FRGP partners. It is virtually free network connectivity.) UCAR is the managing partner of the FRGP and provides engineering and administrative support. There are a number of advantages gained by sharing services through such a GigaPOP, and there are similar GigaPOPs throughout the United States. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The contract to be negotiated is for a 3-month base period followed by four 1-year option periods and one 9-month option period.  SOLE SOURCE:  The FRGP is the one and only responsible source for the required combination of commercial Internet, Internet2 and NLR connectivity in the Colorado area. The Government intends to contract with UCAR since they are the managing partner of the FRGP.   As described above, the only way to access the Internet2 and NLR is through regional GigaPOPs. The FRGP is the only regional access point in Colorado. Cooperation at GigaPOPs is done regionally because the complexity and cost of these advanced networks increases with distance. In Colorado there is not enough user density to justify more than one GigaPOP. Connecting to a GigaPOP other than the closest is not only prohibitively expensive but it is far more complicated to do technically, which makes the system unreliable to an unusable level. Due to this, the GigaPOPs will not permit competition for this NOAA Boulder requirement.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice.    See note 22.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with Microsoft Consulting Services, Washington, D.C., for the support of USSOCOM currently deployed and future proposed Microsoft Corporation information technology products and systems. Microsoft products have been specially designed and configured by Microsoft to support USSOCOM requirements.  Access to Microsoft's proprietary technical data, Microsoft's software source codes, Microsoft's programming resources, and Microsoft's product technology/development is required. Minimum security clearance requirements for contractor personnel: Top Secret (SCI). MacDill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to Microsoft under the authority of FAR 6.302-1—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Additionally, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) applies, i.e., a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and an unacceptable delay would result in not continuing the provision of these highly specialized services from Microsoft.

Questions and Answers for RFQ FA4613-04-Q-0008, Dust Collection System
		
a.	Q:  What are the electrical specifications?
A:  120/208V/4-wire/3Phase/60Hz will be provided.

b.	Q:  Will all the equipment ever be run 100% of the time?
A:  We estimate 95% of the time however, plan on a 100% running capacity.

c.	Q:  Where will the electrical disconnect be placed for hook-up?
A:  We will run just inside the building near the concrete platform and the contractor must run from this point of connection.

d.	Q:  In the demolition phase, who will patch the hole from where the old system penetrated the wall?
A:   The base will take responsibility  

f.	Q:  Are there easement restrictions on how close we can place the unit stand legs to the building?
	A:  There is nothing in the code on how far away from the building it has to be. 
	
g.	Q:  What are the hours of operation for the Skills Center?
	A:  Tues, Wed, Thurs, and Fri - 1130 830
		Sunday and Monday - Closed
		Sat 0930-1630

h.	Q:  Is the air to be return to space or exhausted outside?
	A:  Since you can't separate the dust from the air, it has to be exhausted to the outside.  However, I would suggest that the air has to be replaced by another fan in the system.  You can't create a negative air pressure in the building.  There is an existing HVAC unit, in the attic above the main wood shop room that the base can use to provide up to 4500 CFM and 300,000 BTU's of heated air.  

	i.	Q:  Are we replacing all duct, hoods, etc?
	A:  The only ductings that may be reutilized are the floor vents and only if the awarded contractor inspects, cleans, and deems them serviceable.  The awarded contractor will include this ducting in their warranties.  All other parts of the current system are to be replaced in total.

j.	Q: The unit we have in mind has a clearance width of 80" under the hopper and the dumpster detail note a width of approximately 84".  Is an alternate size dumpster available with a width of 80" or less to fit this width?
	A:  No.  The standard size is 84".
