source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals,
quotations or capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days(30 days if
award is issued under an existing BOA) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government
not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in

satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The intended source of supply for this solicitation is Oil States Industries Inc. Oil States will be solicited because the articles to be acquired
are highly specialized parts, designed and manufactured by a non-Government activity and the technical data required for this acquisition by other than this
source is not available. The articles to be procured are complex and must meet operational and reliabil ity requirements, the achievement of which requires unique production techniques and extensive and/or sophisticated testing, and the
Government has not yet acquired or developed the technical data.

The Program Executive Office, Command, Control, <br> Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) on behalf of Headquarters, Department of <br> the Army is seeking sources to provide Army Mission Command Modernization <br> support in the analysis, assessment and development of strategic documents <br> and programs for Program Objective Memorandum (POM) FY16-20 and beyond, tied <br> to Army Force Generation Model (ARFORGEN) Process. This support will consist <br> of the following areas: Mission Command Portfolio Strategy (i.e. Transport, <br> Command Post, Handheld, Network Operations, Common Operating Environment, <br> Network Integration Evaluation, Testing); Requirements Generation; Satellite <br> Communications (SATCOM) Support Services; Force Development Capability Set <br> Fielding and Platform Integration Support. It is anticipated that this effort will be released as a TOTAL (100%) SMALL BUSINESS set-aside for Small Business concerns in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2 and Subpart 19.502. <br>  <br>   <br> Background:  <br>   <br>  <br> The goal of Army Mission Command Modernization is to develop and field a <br> versatile and affordable mix of the best equipment available to allow <br> Soldiers and units to succeed in both today's and tomorrow's full spectrum <br> military operations. The 2012 Army Modernization Strategy defines how the <br> U.S. Army continues to modernize and transform to fulfill our mission to <br> sustain our Soldiers and maintain readiness of the world's strongest, and <br> most capable Army. It describes the Army's efforts to ensure that Soldiers <br> have the best equipment and necessary capabilities to guarantee their <br> success in any mission or environment. The strategy is designed to describe <br> the Army's overarching goals, priorities, and objectives to both internal <br> and external audiences so that the Army can achieve unity of purpose in its <br> modernization efforts.  <br>  <br>  <br> The Army Mission Command modernization strategy is a team effort across the <br> Army and TRADOC that is focused on the convergence of several systems, <br> providing increased information superiority on the move. The Army's network <br> includes non-developmental Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems, which <br> were fielded to fill capability gaps primarily in Operation Iraqi Freedom <br> (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Current and future Army Mission <br> Command programs will address these capability gaps and reduce the current <br> number of nonstandard products across the battlefield. Concurrently, there <br> will be sufficient programmatic flexibility to allow the Army to <br> incorporate, support, and field emerging capabilities. Starting in FY 13, <br> the Army will incrementally transition from the current legacy and segmented <br> Commercial Off- the-Shelf (COTS) network systems to a centralized network <br> system. To achieve this, the Army will field integrated Capability Sets <br> (CSs) and incrementally modernize the baseline network systems over time, in <br> particular Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T), Family of <br> Networked Tactical Radios, and Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P). The <br> intent is to integrate these Mission Command portfolio elements into one <br> affordable, coherent grid of sensors, Soldiers, platforms, and command posts <br> linked by a robust transport network enabling an integrated suite of Mission <br> Command applications to provide the Warfighters greater access to the larger <br> network capabilities and services.  <br>  <br>  <br> This RFI is for planning and informational purposes only and SHALL NOT be <br> considered as an Invitation for Bid, Requests for Quotation, or Request for <br> Proposal.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>The contractor will be required to install storm water pipes to capture storm water runoff from surrounding hillside.  The primary pipe extends along Cherokee Street approximately 1,900 feet and consists of 66-inch to 78-inch RCP. The primary pipe starts at the upstream inlet and extends to Turkey Creek, crossing Southwest Boulevard and a main line railroad track.  Alignment of the Cherokee Interceptor will require coordination of utility companies, tunneling under active rail line, control of storm water in and outside of pipes, and traffic control.
