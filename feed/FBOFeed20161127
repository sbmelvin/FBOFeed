In order to receive a technical acceptability rating of "acceptable", the contractor's proposed hotel/apartment shall be NCIS/STAAT-assessed within the last three (3) years and shall have met the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work. If not previously assessed, adequate time must exist to allow for the proper assessment of the facility without impact to the required start of performance date.

Additionally, the Government has a minimum occupancy per location of thirty (30) personnel. A proposed location that is unable to accommodate at least 30 personnel may be found unacceptable.</p>

<p>In accordance with the CENTCOM Force Protection requirements, occupancy rates of US Forces personnel at local hotels/apartments shall not exceed 25% of the total units of the apartment/hotel or facility. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation to the lowest-priced technically acceptable contractors on a per unit price/per bed space basis.</p>
<p>System for Award Management -. By submission of a bid, the bidder acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the bidder does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered bidder.
