<p>Army Contracting Command Orlando anticipates releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) during the second quarter fiscal year 2019. The Final RFP release date remains anticipated for the 2nd Qtr. FY 2019.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Delivery Order Descriptions</p>
<p>3.1 SCETI: (Reminder - see detailed SOW and Performance Specifications). PM ITTS IMO has a requirement from the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to provide the Atmospheric Conditions Enhancement (ACE) for the System-of-Systems Controlled Environment Test Infrastructure (SCETI) at Redstone Test Center (RTC). ACE will include the development of Snow Development Capability (SDC), Fog Development Capability (FDC), and enhancements to the existing Atmospheric Measurement (AM) capability to measure those new environmental conditions. SCETI is an outdoors instrumentation test system currently under development at Redstone Test Center (RTC) and used to verify the functionality of aircraft sensor assemblies within degraded visual environment (DVE) conditions. SCETI will be comprised of an Emulated Flight Capability (EFC) to replicate rotary winged flight scenarios with the sensor assemblies secured to a payload structure, a Rain Development Capability (RDC) to develop DVE rain conditions, and an AM capability to characterize rain and dust. SCETI will be operated from a Government-provided Test Control Center (TCC) using the RTC/Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Architecture for Test and Evaluation of Hostile Fire (RATH), an architecture developed at RTC based on the Test/Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).</p>
<p>3.2 TNM: (Reminder - see detailed SOW and Performance Specifications). PM ITTS has a requirement from ATEC to modernize the Test Network at Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), in Ft. Huachuca, AZ in support of Testing Instrumentation for the Test Network Modernization Program (TNM). It is ATEC's mission and vision to establish Enterprise based solutions for all existing test centers instrumentation networks to efficiently support sustainment, training, operations, and future upgrades to these critical instrumentation capabilities. The end result is to effectively modernize existing ATEC networks to be more secure, reliable, and efficient. The goal of the overarching TNM Program is to establish an enterprise environment for commonality, interchangeability, and interoperability via an approach that will standardize architecture, configuration, hardware and network management tools across ATEC test centers. The EPG Test Instrumentation Systems Network (TISN-EN) solution shall create an Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Environment across all Army Test Evaluation Command (ATEC) Test Centers relying on a standardized core Internet Protocol (IP) transport service network (Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Service Network with security stack services and a standardized Test Center Area Distribution Network (Test Center Area Network (TCAN)). It is intended for the TCAN to interconnect existing ATEC Test Center via the DISN-EN transport network to promote joint collaboration and data sharing. The MPLS is a type of data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunication networks; this network protocol has been selected to achieve ATEC's Test Center's interoperability to meet the high-performance demands of military test and evaluation system requirements.</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP FLC Norfolk Philadelphia Office Contracting Department intends to acquire services to support the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) Contact Center Tier 1 and specific Tier 2 services dedicated to Manpower, Personnel, Training  and  Education (MPT and E).  Navy Personnel Command (NPC) is required to provide Human Resources customer services to Sailors, veterans, retirees and family members through a new organization called MNCC.  The MNCC Contact Center is at the heart of one-stop shopping and addresses customer questions and provides information to respond to inquiries regarding personnel concerns.  This effort is designed to improve the quality of HR customer service support provided to all stakeholders, and make it easier to obtain information and direction on how to complete HR and career management tasks.

This support will be obtained through the acquisition of HR contact center labor for NPC, and to expand to support the Navys MPT and E enterprise.
 NPC has an extensive requirement for inbound customer and contact touch points, outbound contacts for follow-up and resolution of customer issues, and the requirement for obtaining customer feedback on quality of service through customer satisfaction surveys.  The MNCC contact center should be prepared to respond to serviced population customer requests in an omni-channel approach that includes, telephone, mobile, IVR, email, text, fax, chat, web requests and other emerging correspondence technologies.  It is expected that the center will eventually operate with processes and procedures using best practices found in large call centers used commercially that have greater than 500 agents operating at a given time and the requisite quality, training, and leadership in place.

The services required include the operation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution and ultimately, an integrated telephony capability.
 These technologies will be provided as government furnished equipment to the contractor. A summary of the production and services support include:  Develop, document, implement and maintain processes and procedures for daily operations of the MNCC Contact Center; provide accurate and timely response to all telephone calls, voice mail, email, chat, text and web-based inquiries; receive and process correspondence submitted for consideration by selection boards; and support other administrative processes as directed by the government.  The contact center will also need to be operated using a modern Work Force Optimization (WFO) product and the associated procedural techniques.  While technology will be primarily GFE (telephony and CRM)

The MNCC Contact Center must operate using contact center industry standard methods and commercial best practices to respond to HR-related service requests.
 Performance measures for the contractor will include service level agreements related to expected time to answer calls, first call resolution rate, abandoned calls, talk time, average handle time, and effective workforce management methods.  The contractor will be required to supply sufficiently qualified staff to support a contact center operation capable of supporting Navys military HR service requests.  Initial estimates of annual contact volume for this contact center is 5M contacts.  In addition to providing contact center agents and technical support staff to operate the CRM application, the contractor will be required to provide administrative support personnel who can perform routine administrative tasks assigned by the government.
 The contact center staff will support the Navy in a wide variety of service delivery scenarios, to include normal HR service requests related to pay, career planning, and emergency response situations like weather or mass casualty events.
The MNCC Contact Center operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week, at two initial locations (Millington, TN and Norfolk, VA), with others that are potentially added during the performance period.  Performance is anticipated to commence 01 April 2018.  The Service Contract Act is applicable to this requirement.  It is the Governments intent to process this procurement through a 100% Small Business Set Aside in accordance with FAR 15 to ultimately award an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract where both cost-type and firm fixed price task orders may be issued.
The applicable NAICS code is 561422.

Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading at the NECO website: http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 21 November 2018. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office. The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments hereto. The Government will not pay for the information received. By submitting a proposal, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal. By submission of a proposal, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database shall make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/protal/public/SAM/. Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted via email to peter.certo@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>66--Procurement of a Xylem SI Analytics TitroLine 7800 universal titrator with IDS
<SOLNBR>68HERC19Q0015
<RESPDATE>111618
<ARCHDATE>05022019
<CONTACT>Loesch, Kimberly F.
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i), with YSI Incorporated for a Xylem SI Analytics TitroLine 7800 universal titrator with IDS technologies.  This instrument will replace an obsolete TitroLine universal titrator system installed in a re-circulating pipe loop system constructed eight years ago for lead, copper, and iron corrosion research.  The EPA plans to continue to use a multifunctional titration system to understand the relationship between factors affecting lead, copper, and iron release in drinking water distribution systems. 

A re-circulating pipe loop system was constructed 8 years ago including a TitroLine universal titrator system. The pipe loop is used to study the effects of pH, disinfectants (oxidant demand), inorganic and organic contaminants on lead, copper, and iron release in drinking water. The current re-circulating pipe loop consists of four 10L polyacrylic covered tanks used as water reservoirs.  Each tank provides water to two pipe loops for a total of eight loops. Each tank was constructed to include ports for pH probe, ORP (oxidation and reduction potential) probe, and TitroLine universal titrator system for continuous and simultaneous acid/base pH titration. A total of 12L of water circulates through each loop in the system. Orbital magnetic drive pumps (March Model AC-3CP-MD) attached to the tank with Tygon plastic tubing pump the water from the back of the tank through a flow meter that regulates the flow. The water runs through approximately 2 feet of plastic tubing placed in a refrigerated water bath (Neslab RTE-221) to maintain the temperature at 19C 1C before the water returned to the tank. The pH probes measure the pH and are connected to an 8-port pH sensor interface (SensoLab, Jensen Systems). Multi-T 2.2 software (Jensen Systems) is used to monitor and maintain the pH 0.15. Automatic titrators, (Schott Titronic Universal Model), one for acid injection and one for base injection, connect to the Jensen Systems controller and are used to maintain the pH in each pipe loop with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 

The EPA has identified YSI as the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirements because the Xylem SI Analytics TitroLine 7800 universal titrator with IDS technologies is the only instrument that has the following characteristics:

*	Integration to the existing pipe loop titration system (see photo of system in attached document). This must include the Multi_T electrode interface to allow both systems to work together.  
*	Electrode interface shall have several configurations, including 2x pH/mv; 4x pH/mv or 8x pH/mv inputs.  All variables shall be able to be measured simultaneously and/or independently.
*	Automatic Titration System. 
*	Multitasking (1-8 titrations simultaneously).
*	Water applications: acid/base titrations; redox titrations; pH/mv endpoint and equivalence point;  end point chloride; alkalinity; hardness; and nitrogen concentrations.
*	Digital sensors for the determination of pH and ORP, conductivity, sodium, dissolved oxygen, and ion-selective indicator electrodes for calcium, copper, lead. 
*	An advanced data handling software with full validation and the capability to view all live curves simultaneously.  
*	First derivative, second derivative, intersecting lines, grans plot capabilities.

This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures and FAR Part 13 Acquisition Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - AeroMP
<SOLNBR>PR-ORD-18-02484
<RESPDATE>111718
<CONTACT>Kimberly Loesch, Contracting Officer, Email Loesch.Kimberly@epa.gov - Brad Werwick, Contracting Officer & FBO Posting Representative , Email werwick.brad@epa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory located in Cincinnati, Ohio has a requirement for a computer controlled aerosol management platform. The EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with Biaera Technologies, LLC for an AeroMP Aerosol Management Platform.</p>
<p>The AeroMP Aerosol Management Platform will be used in conjunction with the aerosol containment system (ACS), currently installed in the Environmental Protection Agency's Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. The ACS allows aerosolization research involving the exposure of animals to high concentrations of aerosolized forms of chemical and biological agents (including infectious organisms) in order to study pathogenicity and virulence. The ACS consists of three pieces of equipment, integrated and custom-fitted into a single unit, composed of (1) a Madison Aerosol Exposure Chamber (AEC) connected to (2) a customized class III Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) glovebox, which in turn is connected to (3) a class II biological safety cabinet via a class III pass-through cabinet. The collison nebulizer is attached to the front door of the AEC and is safely contained inside the BSC III.</p>
<p>Utilizing this system, researchers can determine a dose-response model, altering flow rate, bacterial aerosol concentration, and exposure time. The addition of the AeroMP system will allow researchers to control and monitor all aspects of the inhalation exposure, to include aerosol generation, characterization, and sampling, airflow, system balancing, environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and pressure), animal respiration, and dose calculation. The AeroMP Aerosol Management Platform includes an AeroMP Interface Platform with laptop computer and AeroMP Control Software, a vacuum pump, glass impingers, air compressor/dry cabinet, and custom fittings, filters, and tubing.</p>
<p>The EPA has identified Biaera Technologies as the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because the AeroMP Aerosol Management Platform is the only aerosol control system that is:</p>
<p>&bull; Computer controlled.<br />&bull; Small enough to fit inside a BSC III glovebox, allowing the use of the AeroMP without opening the isolator. <br />&bull; A negative pressure system to allow for research with potentially infectious agents.<br />&bull; Safely decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) gas without degradation of materials. <br />&bull; Designed with soft edges so as not to tear the isolator gloves or compromise the integrity of the containment system<br />&bull; Able to be assembled and operated inside the isolator, without the use of tools, which can be hazardous inside an isolator.</p>
<p>This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures and FAR Part 13 Acquisition Procedures. It is our intent to award a single, fixed price purchase order for the aerosol management platform. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Any firm that is capable of meeting the EPA's requirement, as set forth above, may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration. Submit your request in writing to Kimberly Loesch via email at Loesch.Kimberly@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael Ashworth, Contract Specialist, Email michael.ashworth@opm.gov
<DESC><p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately 15 days or later after release of this announcement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking to obtain Strategic Human Capital Consulting and Technical Support Services for the HRLOB as a small business set-aside under solicitation 24322619R0001. The HRLOB is governed by the Multi-Agency Executive Strategy Committee (MAESC) consisting of twenty-four Federal cabinet agencies. The HRLOB initiative takes a line of business approach and builds upon previous e-Gov initiatives' successes. The HRLOB approach is to enable the Chief Human Capital Officer's (CHCO) vision and promote the government-wide strategic management of HC from "strategy to separation" to optimize Federal mission delivery.</p>
<p>HRLOB requires support in planning, developing, implementing and promoting Human Capital (HC) strategies to drive HC Standards and Management &amp; Modernization, HC Policy, Performance and Operations, and HC Community Engagement and Communication. The overall objectives are to (1) Create a modern, standardized human capital environment that meets the needs of the Federal workforce and enables the continuous improvement of HC management and service delivery, (2) Increase efficiencies in the acquisition, development, and delivery of HC services and supporting systems to improve service quality and reduce duplicative spend, (3) Enable collaboration between HC customers, providers, executive stakeholders, and supporting partners to leverage the government's collective expertise in establishing common HC principles, (4) Support the complete, secure, and timely sharing of information across an employee's career to improve workforce engagement and confidence in Federal HC management.<br /><br />OPM proposes to award a single firm-fixed-price, performance based "C" type contract with a one-year base period and four one-year options but reserves the right to award more, less or none at all. The places of performance will be at the contractor's facility and on-site at the Theodore Roosevelt Building, located at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415.</p>

PRIVACY & SECURITY:

Contractors, Contractor personnel, Subcontractors, and Subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS:

A Contractor/Subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, Subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
All Contractors, Subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for Contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the Contractor/Subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.  
The Contractor or Subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the Contractor or Subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the Contractor or Subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE:

Information made available to the Contractor or Subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the Contractor/Subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the Contractor/Subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the Contractors/Subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the Contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of Contractor and Subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
Prior to termination or completion of this contract, Contractor/Subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the Contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a Contractor/Subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the Contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
The Contractor/Subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
The Contractor/Subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractor/Subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the Contractor/Subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
The Contractor/Subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
The Contractor/Subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the Contractor/Subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The Contractor/Subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
Notwithstanding the provision above, the Contractor/Subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the Contractor/Subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the Contractor/Subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the Contractor/Subcontractor has access.
To the extent known by the Contractor/Subcontractor, the Contractor/Subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the Contractor/Subcontractor considers relevant.
With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the Contractor/Subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its Subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.




LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the Contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the Contractor/Subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
The Contractor/Subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
Description of the event, including:
date of occurrence;
data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

<CONTACT>Panasiewicz, Cynthia  A.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to OLI Systems, Inc. to purchase OLIs Studio and Flowsheet software programs.  This requirement is considered a sole source to OLI Systems because, to the best of the NETLs knowledge based on market research conducted, OLI Systems is the author and sole owner of OLI software (including OLI Flowsheet: ESP and OLI Studio: Stream Analyzer and Silver Service); and the confirmed sole authorized distributor and seller of OLI Software.  NETLs Research & Innovation Center (RIC) utilizes various software programs for model building and has determined that the OLI Studio/Flowsheet software is the only known program that meets the requirement needs of NETLs brine separation processes.  NETL RIC needs to input known chemistry inputs (i.e. concentrations of ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2, Sr+2, Ba+2, Cl-, HCO3-, CO3-2, SO4-2) into a program and then model various water treatment processes, such as MVR, MED, RO, UF and NF.  These models will be used to estimate the capital cost, required chemicals, and power/heat consumption of various water treatment processes.  OLI Studio/Flowsheet is the only known software that can perform both of these functions at the same time, while providing accurate predictions for precipitation of ions, such as calcium and barium sulfate, without having to provide user-defined inputs.  The anticipated overall performance period is for a base year period plus up to four, one-year optional renewal periods through November 2013.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement needs.    
  
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:30 PM ET on November 17, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Cynthia Panasiewicz, via email at Cynthia.Panasiewicz@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>Description of Project:</p>
<p>Work consists of repairs to restore the Culverts S-252 D, E &amp; F in the upper St. Johns River Basin in Indian River County, Florida where ten 72" diameter corrugated metal pipe (CMP) culverts have severely corroded. The work will require demolition and removal of the exposed portions of the culverts which extend beyond the levee embankments. Repairs will require slip-lining and grouting of these culverts using 63" outer diameter (59" inner diameter) ASTM D3035 HDPE pipe. Each culvert is approximately 100 feet in length. Manually operated flap gates will need to be replaced with automatic flap gates or duckbill gates at one end of the five culverts at S-252 E. Existing aluminum slide gates at one end of the 3 culverts at S-252 D &amp; F will be reused and will require transition pieces be fabricated and installed to bridge the 63" OD pipe with the gates fabricated for the 72" CMP. The two remaining roadway culverts will not have gates.</p>
<p>Specific Project Challenges:<br /><br />Slip-lining will be performed sequentially to keep the other culverts in operation during the repairs. The work will be performed in the wet to avoid dewatering.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
Wellness Network Patient Education

Chicago, Il 60612

1.  PURPOSE  
The purpose is to procure access to a subscription based patient education television portal or equivalent software for the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, 820 S. Damen Ave, Chicago, IL 60612.

The system provides a VA Solutions Library with lists of multiple video content that would be available online as well as the preloaded tablets with the VA Limited Custom level.
 Patient education is an important part of care for both the provider and the patient. All too often with time constraints, communication or language barriers, cultural differences, and other issues we face in practice today, patient education may not always end up being the focus of care. Patient education is effective in the transfer of knowledge and skills, but alone is not enough for achieving any type of behavior change. Although by no means a replacement of provider-patient interaction or other educational approaches, videos can be a great way to help supplement the patient education provided during a provider patient encounter. The best method of educational retention comes from approaches such as teach back or motivational interviewing, and when video is used in combination it can significantly improve patient s retention of the education being provided.

Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.  If a requirement shall result from this RFI / Sources Sought, the limitations on subcontracting and non-manufacturer rule shall be included in any future solicitation.  The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R.  121.406].  To qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States.  

To qualify as a small business under a small business set-aside contract, the offeror must be considered a small business under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement.  In addition, the small business must either (1) be the manufacturer of the end item being produced (and the end item must be produced in the US) or (2) comply with the non-manufacturing regulations in 13 CFR 121.406.  

Summary of Non-Manufacturing regulations:
The small business cannot exceed 500 employees;
The small business is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;
The small business takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practices; and 
The small business will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer made in the United States, unless the SBA has issued a waiver to this requirement.  When multiple items are being acquired, a waiver is not required if at least 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured by small businesses.  

Additional information can be found on SBA s website (www.sba.gov) and in SBA s Contracting Guide (https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide). 

Essential Information Regarding Small Business Set-Asides for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
VA s Veterans First Contracting Program:  The Veterans First Contracting Program applies to VA contracts only.  VA has a preference to award contracts to verified service disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) first, and then to verified Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) when market research provides a reasonable expectation that the VA will receive two or more offers from eligible SDVOSB/VOSB firms at a fair and reasonable price.  To be eligible for a VA SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside, the firm must be verified in the VA s Office of Small Business Utilization s (OSDBU) Veteran Information Pages (VIP) database as an SDVOSB or VOSB at the time the firm submits its offer to the VA.  Additional information on VA s Veterans First Contracting Program can be found on OSDBU s website at https://www.va.gov/osdbu/verification/.  In addition, the SDVOSB/VOSB must qualify as a small business under SBA s regulations.  

AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

For market research, the VA must be able to determine if an item is being sourced from the gray market or if the item is being provided by an authorized dealer/distributor.   

Gray market items are defined as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.  Gray market items are also known as parallel market.  Parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.
a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any potential solicitations and procurements will be for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers and/or facilities.  No remanufactured, gray market, or parallel market items will be acceptable.

Be advised any future solicitation that results from this RFI / Sources Sought, will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment.  This RFI / Sources Sought is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured, gray market or parallel market items will not be acceptable sources.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by VA to form a binding contract. 

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors, who are able to meet VA s requirements in the transition of Co-located Hosting Services (CHS).  Any contract/order that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  VA is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become VA property and will not be returned.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this acquisition is 517311.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is 1500 employees.  Please indicate your company size and socio-economic status under this NAICS.

The Contractor shall provide a like-for-like transition of all Networx contracted co-location services to a new contract vehicle award for Co-located Hosting Service (CHS).  The like-for-like transition means that where a technology exists today, it will transition to a like technology provided by the contractor.  For example, if a fiber cross connect is currently contracted, a fiber cross connect will be procured on the new contract. 

VA intends to upgrade services if the existing contracted services have reached end of life and require an upgrade.  The upgrade will be a like-for-similar upgrade.  For example, if Battery Distribution Fuse Bays (BDFBs) are currently being used and they are at end of life, the replacement model will be procured as part of the Contractor s Transition Project.

VA seeks to acquire Co-located Hosting Service.  A full technical description of the service type is in section 3 below.  VA may award up to two (2) contracts, with each providing CHS at two data center locations.  Alternatively, VA is considering making one award for all four locations. 
See Attachment titled VA Co-Located Hosting Services Request for Information and additional documents for more information.

<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">On June 28, 2018 the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) transferred FY-2018 funds of $3.8 million in the FY 18 budget to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to establish and conduct cooperative research projects identified as priorities by the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) for the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CHTEP) in conjunction with USDA APHIS and ARS. </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The ARS-Plains Area has established 12 <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Non-Assistance Cooperative Agreements (NACA&rsquo;s)</em> with four Texas universities (Texas A&amp;M University, College Station; Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville, Kingsville; University of Texas San Antonio, San Antonio; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg). This appropriation requires the establishment of accelerated research and development for support of integrated eradication efforts of the cattle fever tick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These ticks transmit the agents causing bovine babesiosis (commonly termed cattle tick fever), and anaplasmosis which can kill cattle. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Because of the complexity and diversity of the research, communication coordination between the universities and ARS scientists is imperative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All of the necessary program documents, equipment purchasing, agreements, and progress reports need to be accomplished with end of FY18 time constraints. Due to the late appropriation of funds by Congress in FY 17, it would be impossible to meet deadlines without support personnel. Therefore, a temporary contract project manager is needed to assist the Plains Area Office in establishing this new research project. </span></p>

Any responses received will not be considered nor used as a proposal.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) is conducting market research for the purpose of identifying possible sources and the availability of a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) inject and scenario based simulation software to be used by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to teach, monitor, and review decision-making<br />skills. FLETC scenarios are built as a timeline of events called injects which can take the form as interviews, newsfeeds, conversations, CCTV footage, documents, or other media. These injects are then sent to end-users according to the scenario timeline to generate discussion and illicit the need for a group decision to be made by end-users. Instructors can monitor the decision-making process from a control room and choose to send additional injects to influence end-user decisions. Final decisions are documented and later discussed with the entire class.</p>
<p>The inject and scenario based simulation software will be utilized by FLETC's Critical Incident Command Center (CICC). The CICC is used in FLETC Center Advanced Training Programs (such as the Leadership In a Crisis Training Program) which provides Law Enforcement Officers<br />(LEO) leaders' tools for more effective and efficient decision-making. During training, LEO leaders will learn to work with other Law Enforcement managers in achieving a common goal.<br />Additionally, LEOs enhance interpersonal skills that are vital in multiagency coordinated<br />efforts. The inject and scenario based simulation software must meet current industry standards and provide high levels of training realism, immersion and quality.</p>

<DESC>This is a Special Notice of intent to procure SoundTrap ST4300 4-channel recorders that provide up to 16 days of continuous operation on all four channels at a 288kHz sampling rate, or up to 3 months with duty-cycled recording. A recently available modified version of the ST4300 allows for acoustic sampling at 576kHz on 2 channels, a configuration necessary for recording of the highest frequency cetacean species. The SoundTrap ST4300 recorder delivers high performance multi-channel recording in the smallest size and most robust option currently available on the market. The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) requires the purchase of 7 SoundTrap ST4300 units for use during field research projects in 2019. PIFSC proposes to purchase the required instrumentation on a sole source basis from Ocean Instruments, Inc. The Government intends to acquire the equipment using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price purchase order with an approximate delivery date of January 7, 2019. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511 with a corresponding size standard of 750 employees. This Special Notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available; however, potential sources who believe they have the expertise and capability to meet the requirements may submit such documentation to the attention of the Contracting Officer via email at Stephanie.M.Garnett@noaa.gov no later than Monday, November 12, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. HST. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete this requirement is solely the Government's discretion as it is the Government's belief that only Ocean Instruments can provide the requirements as stated above.<br /><br />All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information, and to register, please see www.sam.gov. All offerors must also obtain a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request for Information (RFI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Naval Air Systems Command-Aircraft Division, Aircraft Combat Survivability Division (AIR-4.1.8) is seeking information from industry on Countermeasure Systems to protect the KC-130J and C-40A aircraft operating in a variety of threat environments.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The United States Marine Corps and United States Navy are conducting a study/market research in order to:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>evaluate the existing combat survivability of the KC-130J and the C-40A, a derivative of the Boeing 737-700C, configurations and assess material solutions to enhance the combat survivability of these aircraft in their respective threat environments</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>develop a KC-130J and C-40A Combat Survivability Enhancement Roadmap to include the Technical Readiness Levels of potential survivability enhancement material solutions</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>provide recommendations for survivability enhancement Operational Requirements Document (ORD)/ Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements</p>
<p>For the purpose of this RFI, the threats of primary interest for the KC-130J include medium range Radio Frequency (RF) guided Surface-to-Air Missile systems (RF SAMs), Electro-Optical or RF-guided Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) systems, and Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) missiles acting independently or as part of an Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the threats may also include long range RF SAMs and Air-to-Air Interceptors (AAIs); armed with a variety of IR and RF guided missiles, operating as part of the IADS.</p>
<p>The threats of interest for the C-40A include MANPADS and potentially long range RF SAMS and AAIs armed with a variety of IR and RF guided missiles, operating as part of the IADS.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For planning purposes, the countermeasure suites should be of sufficient Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to support production incorporation in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Desired:</span></p>
<p>The following information regarding countermeasure suites for potential use on the KC-130J and C-40A aircraft is being requested. Note that the suites for the KC-130J and C-40A do not need to be the same; however, commonality of weapons replaceable assembly (WRA) selected for use on each aircraft would be beneficial.</p>

<SUBJECT>The Naval War College has a requirement to participate in the ELOC Newport. Total of 68 hours of labor plus travel. Period of Performance: Date of Award to 19 July 2019.
<SOLNBR>N0012419Q0040
<ARCHDATE>11142018
<CONTACT>
<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE

The Naval War College has a requirement to facilitate the ELOC course in accordance with the provided statement of work. Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.

As evidenced in the sole source justification provided by the requiring activity there is only one contractor that has the specific qualifications that meet the peculiar requirements of this contract.
The ELOC course is tailored for an officer in the rank/pay-grade of Navy Captain/O-6 on the numbered fleet staff to bridge educational gaps between courses offered for the Flag level and those offered to officers in the pay-grades of 0-2 through 0-5. The courses are taught at the NWC campus in Newport, RI with students assigned TAD for the week-long ELOC. NWC resident faculty members prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses. Because the course attendees are senior O-6s, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course. The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, operational experience in maritime warfare at senior/executive levels, experience as a numbered Fleet Commander, familiarity with the regional maritime issues, an understanding of Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level.
 Discussions will often be at the classified level, requiring an active security clearance.

The Contractor identified is VADM (Ret.) Costello. The period of performance will be from date of contract award to 19 July 2019. The NAICS code is 611710 and the small business size is $15M.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE

On behalf of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) - Main Campus, 3001 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, the Great Lakes Acquisition Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract to Quest Diagnostics, Inc. for Reference Laboratory Testing Services, in accordance with Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items at FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

Services required include the transportation of clinical laboratory specimens to the Contractor s laboratory(s), the performance of specimen preparation, if necessary, analytical testing as defined by the Contractor s reference test manual of approximately 960 different tests, the electronic interface reporting of analytical test results into both VA and DOD systems, and consultative services. The performance period will be 01 December 2018 through 31 May 2019.

Quest Diagnostics is the only known contractor that has the resources (manpower, experience, technical/operational knowledge, interconnection of the two computer systems, VA VISTA and DOD CHCS, and confirmed functional test databases) to perform the critical mission for the short-term contract by 01 December 2018 without interruption. Awarding to any vendor other than Quest Diagnostics would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the FHCC Main Campus  requirements and the consequences would be detrimental to providing timely patient care. In order to electronically transmit test results into the two computer systems in use at the FHCC, contractors are required to have an existing approved national Interconnection Security Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement/Agreement to Connect with the VA and DOD. In addition, any individuals involved in the creation of a test database or specimen processing at the FHCC must have an ANACI Background Investigation initiated prior to accessing the FHCC s computer systems.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511   Medical Laboratories, with a small business size standard of $32.5 million.  

This notice is NOT a request for competitive offers; however, if a vendor feels it can meet the needs of the Government, the following information shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at becky.cincotta@va.gov by Thursday, November 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. central standard time.  

Contractor s Test Manual & pricing
Copy of the current existing approved national Interconnection Security Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement with the VA that shows approval to connect to VISTA
Copy of the current existing approved Agreement to Connect with the DOD that shows approval to connect to CHCS
Evidence of Insurance 

No telephone responses will be accepted. Information received will be used to determine whether it is in the Government s best interest to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition. 

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical with delivery as a sub factor and Past Performance. This will be a best value selection. 

1) Technically Acceptable - In order to be technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. 
Sub factor (a) Delivery - Offeror must be able to make the delivery date requested in the RFQ. Delivery date will be December 20, 2018 which is 30 days from anticipated award date, November 20, 2018. If award date is later than November 20, 2018 then the delivery date will be moved to 30 days from the date of award. 

2) Past Performance - Please provide information on (3) past purchase orders similar to the scope and size of this requirement. 
The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements identified in the RFQ. The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable).   

The evaluation of Past Performance will reflect the consideration of all relevant agency/customer information that is available to the Government, including both the information received from the offerors references and information obtained from other sources.

Technical, delivery, and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>Fermi Research Alliance LLC (FRA) requests a proposal for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) subcontract to provide Commissioning Agent (CxA) services for the Integrated Engineering Research Center (IERC) in Batavia, IL.
<p>The IERC is envisioned as a new, state-of-the-art building with laboratories equipped to deliver on major initiatives in particle physics. The purpose of the IERC project is to construct a building that provides laboratory space for facilities needed for particle physics detector R&amp;D and detector construction for Department of Energy (DOE) projects. The laboratory space is central to the design of the building. The building includes office and technical space for engineers and technicians engaged in detector R&amp;D and construction activities.</p>
<p>The IERC is in the early stages of preliminary design. It is anticipated that the project will consist of a three-story building, measuring approximately 90 feet by 450 feet in plan. A portion of the building will include a high bay. The high bay space will be used to locate clean room lab space and to assemble and test components for Fermilab facilities, research and experiments. The elevated floors will be used for office, lab and technical space. The total construction cost for the building is budgeted at $56 million using a Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC) delivery method.</p>
<p>FRA is committed to commissioning this facility to ensure that all systems are well designed, complete and functioning properly upon occupancy, are economical to operate and maintain, and that FRA staff has adequate system documentation and training.</p>
<p>The Commissioning Agent shall lead, develop and provide the commissioning services for the IERC during the Design Support, Construction, and Post-Construction Stages of the project. The Commissioning Agent's approach to commissioning includes processes and activities that are geared toward providing the A/E, CM/GC, and FRA with a smooth transition between the design, construction, and post-construction phases of the project.</p>
If you are interested in receiving a RFP for this project please e-mail Joe Jarocki at <a href="mailto:jjarocki@fnal.gov">jjarocki@fnal.gov</a> .<br />

<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).<br />Acceptance Period: Your proposal must stipulate that is predicated upon all terms and conditions of this RFP. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a pre-solicitation and a notice of intent to award a sole-source, fixed price purchase order to Subject7, Inc., 11121 Stackhouse Court, Potomac, MD 20854, for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to procure for the Office of Extramural Research (OER), electronic Research Administration (eRA) Subject7 Proof Software Licenses. This software is unique and proprietary to Subject7. <br />The eRA Program uses an Agile development methodology, which requires automated functional testing to execute frequent regression tests. Proof is a web-based test automation authoring and execution platform from the company Subject7. It is fairly unique among test automation tools in that it is wizard-driven and does not require any scripting or coding. (The Proof platform sits on top of Selenium, which is an open-source test automation platform.) The users work in a graphical environment, rather than using code editors. Since users do not have to program scripts for each and every test case in a native language, it is ideal for use by the 30+ existing eRA testers who do not generally have coding skills.<br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541519 and the business size standard is $25.5 million. This is not a small business set-aside.<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><strong>NOTICES TO QUOTERS:</strong> <br /><br />1) Appropriated funds are not presently available for this requirement; however, there is a reasonable expectation that funds will be committed and certified to result in an obligation under an award of a contract. No contract award can be made in absence of appropriated funds to cover the requirement.<br /><br />2) This acquisition is being conducted as a simplified acquisition pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 13.5.
<p><strong>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation<br /></strong><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05019Q9NMED013. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101.</p>
<p>(iv) This acquisition is "Unrestricted." The associated NAICS code is 713990 with a small business size standard of $7.5M.<br /><br />(v) List of line item numbers and items, quantities, and units of measure:<br />00001 Base Period Firing Range Services (1 Feb 2019 - 31 Jan 2020) 840 Hours<br />10001 Option Year 1 Firing Range Services (1 Feb 2020 - 31 Jan 2021) 840 Hours<br />20001 Option Year 2 Firing Range Services (1 Feb 2021 - 31 Jan 2022) 840 Hours<br />30001 Option Year 3 Firing Range Services (1 Feb 2022 - 31 Jan 2023) 840 Hours<br />40001 Option Year 4 Firing Range Services (1 Feb 2023 - 31 Jan 2024) 840 Hours</p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Use/rental of an existing/established firing range. See Statement of Work for specific requirements for an acceptable firing range.</p>
<p>(vii) Delivery, acceptance, and FOB point are at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br /><br />Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation/provisions <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - The quoted range meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The quoted range does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.</p>
<p>(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda and a statement regarding any addenda to the clause.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(e)</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement.

If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</p>

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY 

1. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
 

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ.  The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.


3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements.  VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information.  Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above.  Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach.  The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data.   Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis.  Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

<p>SECTION II: STATEMENT OF WORK <br />2.1 BACKGROUND<br />Peace Corps is an independent civilian executive agency of the federal government established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to promote world peace and friendship through the service of American Volunteers abroad. The three primary Peace Corps goals established in the founding legislation are:<br />&bull; Improve the lives of people through grassroots assistance,<br />&bull; Foster a better understanding of Americans on the part of the people served, and<br />&bull; Foster a better understanding of other people on the part of Americans.</p>
<p>Under the Global Education Framework (GEF) Agreement with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Peace Corps received funding to create a toolkit for use by Peace Corps Volunteers and counterparts including teachers, school administrators, counselors and other resource personnel who seek to create safe, student-friendly learning environments that support students' holistic development and enable them to thrive and succeed. This toolkit is intended to reflect current thinking on positive youth development (PYD) as outlined in USAID's Systematic Review of Positive Youth Development (http://www.youthpower.org/systematic-review-pyd-lmics), support for life skills and agency, and evidence-based practices for strengthening social and emotional learning (SEL) for children and youth reflecting the five (5) core competencies outlined by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (https://casel.org/). It is also meant to complement the Student-Friendly Schools (SFS) curricula currently used by Peace Corps. SFS is a resource to train Volunteers and counterparts around gender-based violence, making linkages between SEL and PYD approaches and outcomes related to educational achievement for girls and boys, healthy peer relationships, decreased violence and a range of other social and developmental outcomes.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Response: For first part of the question: yes   with two exceptions; items identified as  VA Source #  64 and 231 have been sent back to manufacturer as part of a new source purchase. For second part of question, there are no additional items to be disposed of. 

3. Price schedule 0001   Is it necessary for mixed waste to go to NSSI? Or can other appropriate processors be used?
Response: Any properly licensed/permitted processor could be used should have stated  an appropriately licensed/permitted recipient  vs.  NSSI ; we will need a copy of their radioactive materials license prior to transfer.

4. Price schedule 0002   What compounds are to be recycled?
Response: In this case there are no items specifically designated to be recycled unless the contractor identifies recycling as a more cost-effective strategy.

5. Price schedule 0003   How much DAW? What isotopes what activities? How much do you expect to generate?
Response: Dry waste is about 3-4 cubic feet in total many are larger (decayed) nuc med QC flood sources (~36  x 24 ). All historic waste. No additional lead shielding is likely to be needed for any of the items. No new waste is being generated. The JL Shepherd Cs-137 calibrator (VA Source # 48) and two Cs-137 attenuation devices (VA Source #s 168 and 169) will require DOT Type A packaging but all other items can most likely be shipped as limited quantity excepted packages (from a radioactive materials perspective). All isotopes and activities to be disposed of were provided in Attachments 1 through 9 of the solicitation.

6. Price schedule 0004   Are sealed sources necessary for disposal of items in spreadsheet? Or are there additional items that need disposal?
Response: No this needs clarification, Contractor shall provide for disposal of sealed sources listed in the spreadsheets. All items in the spreadsheets need to be disposed many are disused or decayed sealed sources. There is also some liquid standards (sealed and unsealed) and some dry wastes.

7. Price schedule 0005 -I believe there is a typo here, transpmiation   transportation 
That is a typo should be transportation. 

8. Section B.2 Price/Cost Schedule   Item Number 0002 identifies  Contractor shall provide compounds for recycle . Is it a requirement of this bid specification that the compounds identified in the Attachment 9   Other Items be recycled or can these be sent for processing and disposal if deemed more economically feasible?
Response: Any item may be send for processing and disposal if deemed more economically feasible. Recycling is not specifically required for any item.

9. Section B.2 Price/Cost Schedule   Item Number 0003 identifies  Contractor shall provide DAW and Lead . Based on the information contained within the provided waste inventory list, it looks as though the only lead associated with this bid specification is that identified with the Y-90 Microsphere s Aggregate Waste (if lead vial shields as needed for transportation purposes), possibly some lead associated with the Ra-226 sealed sources, lead that would part of the Cs-137 Amersham Source in Calibrator, and the Cl-36 lead waste. Is this correct, or is there more lead associated with the waste. Also, this Pricing Line Item also identifies DAW. What is the DAW that is referred to in the Pricing Line Item?
Response: There are no additional lead items. It is highly unlikely that any additional lead will need to be provided by the vendor for shipping purposes. Note there are also two Cs-137 items (2 each, 30 mCi) which include depleted uranium as shielding (as part of the device itself).

Response: The bid spec for DAW (Dry Active Waste also known as low-level dry radioactive waste) is confusing. No DAW is actually being  provided by the vendor,  rather disposal of such wastes. DAW in this case is waste that is not considered  sealed sources  or  devices . Items in Attachment 9 that are solids are DAW. Some of those items (e.g., a small amount of uranium acetic acid used for electron microscope staining) may need to be solidified in order to process further and might have to be excluded; vendor assistance is needed to determine best approach.

10. Section B.2 Price/Cost Schedule   Item Number 005 identifies  Contractor shall provide milk-run transportation . 
Is it a requirement of this bid specification that the transportation for the waste materials be on a milk-run (or Less-Than-Truckload) basis? 
Or can the pick-up be using a dedicated transport vehicle?
Will all of the waste material identified in the bid specification be picked during the same time? 
Or is the VA expecting this waste to be picked up over a duration of time?
Response: Item is written in a confusing manner. The contractor shall provide the cost for removing, transporting, disposing of the waste. This waste is all currently sitting onsite for disposal (Attachments 1 through 9); no new wastes are being produced as part of the contract. It can be transported at one time or at different times. The most cost-effective transportation strategy may be determined at the contractor s discretion. This proposed cost may be per unit waste and does not need to break out cost of transportation as a separate item.

11. In Section B.3 Statement of Work   Performance Requirements, there are a number of types of waste identified that are not listed in the provided inventory (i.e. Scintillation Vials/Fluids, Biological Waste). Is the only waste associated with this bid specification those that are identified in the provided inventory list?
Response: Everything is provided in the inventory lists. Any other references are superfluous.

12. In Section B.3 Statement of Work   Performance Requirements identifies a list of documents and information that the  Contractor  is to provide. Is it correct to assume that these submittals are only required from the winning bidder and are not required as part of the proposals?
Response: The contractor should provide their own radioactive materials license if such is possessed. Any licenses from subcontractors such as disposal facilities could be provided at a later date. It is understood that some contractors might not be licensed on their own but may identify and have the hands-on work performed by a licensed waste broker, as a sub-contractor. That is understood and we will permit those licenses may be submitted after the contract is awarded.

13. In Section B.3 Statement of Work   Performance Requirements states  The contractor shall provide a written emergency plan that outlines a formalized response to any accidents, spills or leaks that occur while the contractor is performing work for the facility. The emergency requirement may be in response to an actual, natural or man-made disaster. Also, the emergency requirement may include responding to a special project, which has not been anticipated by the contract parameters.  In this section, it states that  the emergency requirement may include responding to a special project, which has not been anticipated by the contract parameters . Can you please explain what the VA is requesting from the Contractor in support of this? 
Response: We are expecting the vendor to provide a statement to ensure US DOT requirements for emergency response are met per 49 CFR Chapter 1, Subpart G. This really only pertains to possible emergencies during shipping. Most items could be shipped as limited quantity in excepted packaging and be excepted from shipping paper requirements. A small number of items will need Type A packaging for Class 7 materials. Type A packages require emergency response information (including a 24-hour response phone number) be included in the shipping papers. We would expect vendor to describe generally the methods for complying with DOT requirements. 

14. Inventory Sheet   Attachment 9   Other Items identifies a Cs/Ba-137 Syringe containing a total activity of 0.0049 mCi with a contact dose rate of 8 mR/hr. 
Does this item have any RCRA hazardous waste codes associated with it? and if so, please identify them. 
Also, what is the chemical composition of the Cs/Ba liquid?
Response: No RCRA codes are assigned for this item. I am unsure what the Cs/Ba-137 is associated with chemically but it was distributed by a well-known vendor (Oxford Instruments) and is in the original container--which is well marked and does not include any chemical or biohazard labeling beyond simply being radioactive. The source is labeled as an  exempt  source from NRC licensing.

If a non-U.S. company decides to team with a U.S. prime contractor then the U.S. prime contractor must comply with the Department of State 22CFR Parts 120-130 and submit a request for an export license.</p>
<p>DFARS 252.204-7004 ALT A, required Central Contractor Registration applies. Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract.</p>

Fax submittals will not be accepted.<br />Submit mailed quotes to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Room 821, ATTN: Katie White<br />600 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.<br />Place Louisville, KY 40202</p>

<p>Bryan Duvall, Maintenance Leader/ Mark Cardwell, Maintenance Mechanic <br />USACE Louisville District<br />Rough River Lake <br />14957 Falls of Rough Rd<br />Falls of Rough, KY 40119<br />Phone: 270-257-2061</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.</p>
<p>ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration.</p>
<p>Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.</p>
<p>Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Industry Day slides and Q&amp;A Responses are FOUO and must be requested by emailing Shaun Cronen (shaun.m.cronen.civ@mail.mil), CPT Angela Burton (angela.d.burton16.mil@mail.mil), and Chris Laird (christopher.m.laird2.civ@mail.mil) along with your company's CAGE Code.<br /><br />End of Update 02 NOV 2018<br /><br /><br />1.0 Introduction<br /><br />Request for Information. This a Request for Information Only (RFI).<br /><br />Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) in support of the Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S), Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System-Army (PM DCGS-A), is conducting market research to identify commercial items to satisfy current DCGS-A requirements pertaining to United States (U.S.) Army's DCGS-A Data Fabric and Analytics capability. The Government invites all business and academic organizations to respond to this RFI notice.<br /><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The Government may revise its draft requirements at any time, or may elect not to proceed with a procurement. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. This RFI is not an authorization to begin work, and the Government will not pay any costs that contractors may incur in response to this RFI.<br /><br />Contractors are not required to respond to this announcement, but may do so at their own cost. The United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.<br /><br />The Government also intends to hold an Industry Day in accordance with this RFI. The Government will not pay any costs resulting from attendance at an Industry Day.<br /><br />Additionally, the Government may conduct a market research product demonstration in accordance with all or part of this RFI. The Government will not pay any costs resulting from attendance or participation at a market research product demonstration.<br /><br />Only contractors that respond to this RFI are eligible to participate in a market research product demonstration, which is for market research purposes only. Due to schedule and other constraints, the Government may limit participation in a market research demonstration. The Government will not award any contracts solely as a result of a market research product demonstration.<br /><br />Failure to respond to this RFI, or failure to participate in a market research product demonstration, will not preclude contractor participation in any RFP or procurement, if any is issued.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br /><br />The DCGS-A is a systems of systems comprised of an extensive intelligence architecture that enables distributed processing and information sharing of data from sensors and other sources across the globe; software tools to help the users perform the analyses, update, and share intelligence products; servers that store data and collected intelligence; and alignment to a set of common standards that enable integration of new technology, processes, and ideas. As technology evolves and new warfighting requirements emerge, the DCGS-A capability set needs to be updated to meet the user needs.<br /><br />This RFI is focused on identifying commercial items to upgrade/replace the current DCGS-A data architecture as well as introduce several additional analytics and system management functions. Specifically, Capability Drop (CD) 2 focuses on the modernization and enhancement of the DCGS-A Data Fabric and Analytics capabilities across multiple echelons, by providing a scalable solution that provides an adaptable Data Management Architecture (DMA), automated analytics, and common core services.<br /><br />Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager - Foundation (TCM-F) has developed, in conjunction with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), Deputy Chief of Staff G2, Forces Command (FORSCOM) G2, and Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), a draft Capability Drop requirements document outlining the operationally relevant requirements for DCGS-A's Data Fabric and Analytics capability.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI may be used by the Government to determine invitees for a market research product demonstration based on criteria such as: number and quality of the responses, the number of CD2 requirements a solution can currently meet, operational or other history demonstrating the requirements, additional capabilities of interest to the Government, overall technical risk, and the limited availability of Government resources to accommodate a demonstration. Only companies that respond to this RFI, in full, with existing commercial items that currently meet or have the potential to meet, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 Definition of a "commercial item," may be invited to a market research product demonstration. If requested, market research product demonstrations are intended to be completed prior to the end of Calendar Year 2018.<br /><br />3.0 White Paper and Supporting Documentation<br /><br />Any interested business or academic organization should provide a response that addresses each section (1 through 4) below, as well as the Non-Disclosure Agreements in 6.0, no later than 1600 EST on 9 NOV 2018.

Industry participation should be limited to a maximum of three (3) representatives. See below for RSVP instructions.</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command Orlando anticipates releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) during the second quarter fiscal year 2019. The Final RFP release date remains anticipated for the 2nd Qtr. FY 2019.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Delivery Order Descriptions</p>
<p>3.1 SCETI: (Reminder - see detailed SOW and Performance Specifications). PM ITTS IMO has a requirement from the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to provide the Atmospheric Conditions Enhancement (ACE) for the System-of-Systems Controlled Environment Test Infrastructure (SCETI) at Redstone Test Center (RTC). ACE will include the development of Snow Development Capability (SDC), Fog Development Capability (FDC), and enhancements to the existing Atmospheric Measurement (AM) capability to measure those new environmental conditions. SCETI is an outdoors instrumentation test system currently under development at Redstone Test Center (RTC) and used to verify the functionality of aircraft sensor assemblies within degraded visual environment (DVE) conditions. SCETI will be comprised of an Emulated Flight Capability (EFC) to replicate rotary winged flight scenarios with the sensor assemblies secured to a payload structure, a Rain Development Capability (RDC) to develop DVE rain conditions, and an AM capability to characterize rain and dust. SCETI will be operated from a Government-provided Test Control Center (TCC) using the RTC/Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Architecture for Test and Evaluation of Hostile Fire (RATH), an architecture developed at RTC based on the Test/Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).</p>
<p>3.2 TNM: (Reminder - see detailed SOW and Performance Specifications). PM ITTS has a requirement from ATEC to modernize the Test Network at Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), in Ft. Huachuca, AZ in support of Testing Instrumentation for the Test Network Modernization Program (TNM). It is ATEC's mission and vision to establish Enterprise based solutions for all existing test centers instrumentation networks to efficiently support sustainment, training, operations, and future upgrades to these critical instrumentation capabilities. The end result is to effectively modernize existing ATEC networks to be more secure, reliable, and efficient. The goal of the overarching TNM Program is to establish an enterprise environment for commonality, interchangeability, and interoperability via an approach that will standardize architecture, configuration, hardware and network management tools across ATEC test centers. The EPG Test Instrumentation Systems Network (TISN-EN) solution shall create an Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Environment across all Army Test Evaluation Command (ATEC) Test Centers relying on a standardized core Internet Protocol (IP) transport service network (Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Service Network with security stack services and a standardized Test Center Area Distribution Network (Test Center Area Network (TCAN)). It is intended for the TCAN to interconnect existing ATEC Test Center via the DISN-EN transport network to promote joint collaboration and data sharing. The MPLS is a type of data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunication networks; this network protocol has been selected to achieve ATEC's Test Center's interoperability to meet the high-performance demands of military test and evaluation system requirements.</p>

<DESC>November 2, 2018 <br /><br />Sources Sought Notice Amendment 1 - The NIH has changed&nbsp;the minimum requirements of the SOW.&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp;amended&nbsp;draft Statement of Work is attached.&nbsp;If we have already received your company's capability statements, please respond briefly to the below requirements and to the attached Amended Draft SOW to indicate if the capabilities statement is valid under this&nbsp;amendment.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br />--------<br />The National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought notice to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of a responsible/capable offeror to perform the work sought in the attached SOW. Accordingly, NIH is hoping that there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement. Additionally, NIH is attempting to ascertain if there exists a reasonable expectation of at least two responsible/capable small business offerors in order for NIH to compete the requirement as a small business set aside.
<p>Accordingly, NIH is seeking capability statements as to the attached SOW from other-than-small businesses, small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZONE small businesses, small businesses under the 8(a) program, and/or businesses under the GSA Schedule which can perform on-schedule.</p>
<p>THIS MARKET SURVEY/SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE. THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS A CAPABILITY STATEMENT. ALTHOUGH A RESPONDENT CAN RESPOND WITH WHATEVER INFORMATION THE RESPONDENT SEES FIT, THE IDEAL CAPABILITY STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE SOW AND THE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BELOW, AND IS NOT A GENERIC SALES BROCHURE OR MARKETING HANDOUT. FURTHER, THE GOVERNMENT REQUESTS, BUT DOES NOT MANDATE, THAT THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN TEN PAGES.

<p>&bull; NAVSEA may compete both availabilities under a single solicitation on a coast-wide (East &amp; Gulf Coasts) basis. The FY19 USS VICKSBURG (CG 69) MODPRD would be the base work package in the resultant contract, and the FY20 USS ANZIO (CG 68) MODPRD work package would be an option in the resultant contract.</p>
<p>&bull; The anticipated contract type for each of the availabilities will be fixed price.</p>
<p>&bull; The anticipated RFP may potentially be released by 30 November 2018.</p>
<p>Does your company plan to submit a proposal in response to the anticipated solicitation for the two CG Modernization Availabilities?</p>

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>111718
<ARCHDATE>05022019

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 TO NOISS

The purpose of Amendment 1 is to:
1.Change the response due date from November 16, 2018 to November 17, 2018


The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i), with YSI Incorporated for a Xylem SI Analytics TitroLine 7800 universal titrator with IDS technologies.  This instrument will replace an obsolete TitroLine universal titrator system installed in a re-circulating pipe loop system constructed eight years ago for lead, copper, and iron corrosion research.  The EPA plans to continue to use a multifunctional titration system to understand the relationship between factors affecting lead, copper, and iron release in drinking water distribution systems. 

A re-circulating pipe loop system was constructed 8 years ago including a TitroLine universal titrator system. The pipe loop is used to study the effects of pH, disinfectants (oxidant demand), inorganic and organic contaminants on lead, copper, and iron release in drinking water. The current re-circulating pipe loop consists of four 10L polyacrylic covered tanks used as water reservoirs.  Each tank provides water to two pipe loops for a total of eight loops. Each tank was constructed to include ports for pH probe, ORP (oxidation and reduction potential) probe, and TitroLine universal titrator system for continuous and simultaneous acid/base pH titration. A total of 12L of water circulates through each loop in the system. Orbital magnetic drive pumps (March Model AC-3CP-MD) attached to the tank with Tygon plastic tubing pump the water from the back of the tank through a flow meter that regulates the flow. The water runs through approximately 2 feet of plastic tubing placed in a refrigerated water bath (Neslab RTE-221) to maintain the temperature at 19C 1C before the water returned to the tank. The pH probes measure the pH and are connected to an 8-port pH sensor interface (SensoLab, Jensen Systems). Multi-T 2.2 software (Jensen Systems) is used to monitor and maintain the pH 0.15. Automatic titrators, (Schott Titronic Universal Model), one for acid injection and one for base injection, connect to the Jensen Systems controller and are used to maintain the pH in each pipe loop with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 

The EPA has identified YSI as the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirements because the Xylem SI Analytics TitroLine 7800 universal titrator with IDS technologies is the only instrument that has the following characteristics:

*	Integration to the existing pipe loop titration system (see photo of system in attached document). This must include the Multi_T electrode interface to allow both systems to work together.  
*	Electrode interface shall have several configurations, including 2x pH/mv; 4x pH/mv or 8x pH/mv inputs.  All variables shall be able to be measured simultaneously and/or independently.
*	Automatic Titration System. 
*	Multitasking (1-8 titrations simultaneously).
*	Water applications: acid/base titrations; redox titrations; pH/mv endpoint and equivalence point;  end point chloride; alkalinity; hardness; and nitrogen concentrations.
*	Digital sensors for the determination of pH and ORP, conductivity, sodium, dissolved oxygen, and ion-selective indicator electrodes for calcium, copper, lead. 
*	An advanced data handling software with full validation and the capability to view all live curves simultaneously.  
*	First derivative, second derivative, intersecting lines, grans plot capabilities.

This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures and FAR Part 13 Acquisition Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this posting must be submitted via the FedConnect website at https://www.fedconnect.net through the message center for 68HERC19Q0015.  Mail, fax, phone and email submissions shall not be accepted.  EPA anticipates that award will be made by December 14, 2018.

<p>Solicitation 24322619R0001</p>
<p>NAICS 541612 - Human Resources Consulting Services<br />SBA size standard $15.0M</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking to obtain Strategic Human Capital Consulting and Technical Support Services for the HRLOB as a small business set-aside under solicitation 24322619R0001. The HRLOB is governed by the Multi-Agency Executive Strategy Committee (MAESC) consisting of twenty-four Federal cabinet agencies. The HRLOB initiative takes a line of business approach and builds upon previous e-Gov initiatives' successes. The HRLOB approach is to enable the Chief Human Capital Officer's (CHCO) vision and promote the government-wide strategic management of HC from "strategy to separation" to optimize Federal mission delivery.</p>
<p>HRLOB requires support in planning, developing, implementing and promoting Human Capital (HC) strategies to drive HC Standards and Management &amp; Modernization, HC Policy, Performance and Operations, and HC Community Engagement and Communication. The overall objectives are to (1) Create a modern, standardized human capital environment that meets the needs of the Federal workforce and enables the continuous improvement of HC management and service delivery, (2) Increase efficiencies in the acquisition, development, and delivery of HC services and supporting systems to improve service quality and reduce duplicative spend, (3) Enable collaboration between HC customers, providers, executive stakeholders, and supporting partners to leverage the government's collective expertise in establishing common HC principles, (4) Support the complete, secure, and timely sharing of information across an employee's career to improve workforce engagement and confidence in Federal HC management.<br /><br />OPM proposes to award a firm-fixed-price, single performance based stand-alone contract with a one-year base period and four one-year options but reserves the right to award more, less or none at all. The places of performance will be at the contractor's facility and on-site at the Theodore Roosevelt Building, located at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415.</p>
