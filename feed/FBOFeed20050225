<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Kelman North America, Inc., 4147 N Ravens Wood Ave, Chicago, IL 60613-1830.  This purchase order is for a portable dissolved gas analysis system (Kelman Transport X System).  This is the only company found to use the photoacoustic spectroscopy process for measuring moisture in oil.  The system is used for analysis of dissolved gases in transformer, tap changer, and circuit breaker oil.  Dissolved gas analysis is an important component in determining the condition of transformers and thus avoiding expensive failures/outages.  A system which provides on-site analysis in accordance with IEC Standard 567 is required.  The photoacoustic spectroscopy process is required to facilitate use by plant personnel without the need for extensive training.  The photoacoustic spectroscopy process is a more user-friendly process and does not require extensive training to learn testing procedures.    This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is March 8, 2005.

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Sections 3.2.1.3.12 and 3.2.2.4.  The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the decision to contract, in an amount greater than $100,000, with the selected source via single source procedures. The FAA intends to award a contract to T.C. Meuninck to provide his expertise in developing and implementing the Airport Resource Management Tool (ARMT) software functionality for the Washington Metro ARMT application, providing maintenance and adaptation at other locations, and helping to baseline the software and documentation.  The ARMT product serves to fill a gap in the FAA's terminal automation and traffic management programs and has proven itself to be an important tool to help controllers and traffic management specialists in improved performance of arrivals and departures within busy terminal areas. The contract period of performance is from date of contract award with a base year and one option year to be exercised at the Government's discretion.   The award will be made on a single source basis because T. C. Meuninck was instrumental in developing and implementing the ARMT while a government employee.  In particular, T. C. Meunick is the only source code developer and maintainer for this tool.  T. C. Meuninck provides the knowledge and expertise to meet the critical delivery schedule established to provide NAS delay and operational safety improvements at FAA ATC facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area.  The ARMT application presently lacks software and configuration documentation necessary to permit contract performance by anyone else in a timely manner.  T.C. Meuninck is the single source of corporate knowledge on the ARMT software, his expertise is essential in order for the FAA to meet its goals and commitments.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-21 Very High Efficiency Solar Cell; CLOSING DATE:  24 February 2006; PRELIMINIARY PROPOSALS DUE:  12:00 PM, 29 March 2005; local Arlington, VA time; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  3:00 PM, 17 May 2005; local Arlington, VA time.  POC:  Dr. Doug Kirkpatrick, DARPA/ATO; Email: VHESC@darpa..mil ; Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/VHESC/index.htm 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), in collaboration with the Defense Sciences Office (DSO), is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Very High Efficiency Solar Cell program.  The objective of the Very High Efficiency Solar Cell program is to demonstrate at least 50% efficiency in a photovoltaic (PV) device.  Recent developments drawing on the use of engineered biomolecules to guide the assembly of inorganic materials offer the potential of a new process path for fabricating nanoscale, inorganic, three-dimensional meta-structures with dimensional and assembly control not achievable with current technologies.  Combined, these independent advances suggest the potential for manufacturing a new type of high-efficiency, advanced PV solar power source. 

The program requires that teams be formed to comprehensively address all aspects of the high-efficiency PV problem including the development of fabrication processes that are scaleable to industrial manufacturing and an affordable product.  As such, it is envisioned that successful teams may include elements from industry, to include both large and small businesses, academia, and national laboratories, but must include elements from industry appropriate to the subsequent manufacture of successfully developed devices. 

The VHESC program final deliverables will include a minimum of 1,000 units, 10 cm2 per device, producing at least 0.5 W each with the above minimum efficiency, assuming a standard solar fluence of 1 kW/m2. 

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  Preliminary proposals are encouraged in advance of full proposals in order to provide potential proposers with a rapid response and to minimize unnecessary effort.  Preliminary proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn:  BAA05-21) on or before 12:00 PM, March 29, 2005, local Arlington, VA time.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA05-21) on or before 3:00 PM, May 17, 2005, local Arlington, VA time.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Technology Transition Approach; (c) Management Approach, Team Configuration, and Relevant Experience, (d) Schedule and Cost Realism and (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.

       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.  Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

Interested contractors are encouraged to submit a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for information listed below.  This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided by FAR 31.205-18.  “Bid and Proposal Costs.”  If simplifying assumptions are needed to prepare the ROM, respondents are encouraged to make and document the assumptions used in their responses.  Otherwise, questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Ms Marilee Barnes, (801) 586-1707.  All responses are due to the contracting point listed in the RFI by 23 March 05.  


The Government of Ghana is considering a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) purchase of twelve (12) excess T-37B trainer aircraft from the United States Air Force. These aircraft are currently being held in long term storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC), Davis-Monthan AFB (Tucson), Arizona.  
 
If this sale is approved, AMARC personnel will bring each aircraft up to a serviceable and flightworthy condition and perform functional check flights on each aircraft.  AMARC personnel will then document successful completion of each Functional Check Flight in the aircraft records.  AMARC personnel will also prepare the aircraft for shipment to Ghana.  As a minimum, this preparation will include draining the fuel and oil and removing the egress items and batteries.  AMARC will also remove the wings and palletize each aircraft suitable for shipment overseas.

The contractor shall be required to transport the twelve aircraft, the batteries and the egress items, from Tucson, AZ to Ghana.  Upon arrival in Ghana, the contractor shall uncrate and reassemble each aircraft, add fuel and oil, install the batteries and egress items, perform functional check flights on each aircraft, and certify their airworthiness.   
The contractor shall sign for and receive twelve palletized T-37B aircraft from AMARC personnel at Davis Monthan AFB, AZ.
    Each palletized aircraft measures approximately 84" (W) by 360 " (L) by 96" (H) and weigh approximately 9,000 lbs.
            The contractor shall receive the batteries, egress items, and other miscellaneous items from AMARC personnel.
The contractor shall transport twelve T-37B aircraft by the most economical means from Tucson, AZ to Takoradi Air Base, Ghana.  
    Takoradi Air Base is located in western Ghana toward the Cote d'lvoire border.
The contractor shall also transport the batteries, egress items, and other items required to bring these twelve aircraft back 
to an airworthy condition to Takoradi Air Base, Ghana.
The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, and expertise to uncrate, reassemble, and return all twelve aircraft to an
airworthy condition.   
The contractor shall complete functional check flights on each aircraft and certify each aircraft is airworthy.
The airworthy certification shall be documented in the aircraft records.

Once all work is successfully completed and all aircraft are certified as airworthy, the contractor shall sign them over to a representative of the Ghanaian Air Force.

Pre-Invitation Notice: The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the proposed Interior Renovation of the Federal Building located in Des Moines, Iowa. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. A Fixed-Price contract under FAR 16.202-1 is contemplated. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). Project Summary: The Federal Building is located at 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa. The project consists of approximately 390,000 gross square feet while containing approximately 263,500 occupiable square feet.  Approximately forty federal agencies occupy the Federal Building.  Another project is presently underway and involves the Repair and Alteration of the façade of floors 2 through 10, including the penthouse and roof.  The exterior façade replacement project addresses air and water infiltration though the building envelope, and is expected to be complete January 2005.  

The Interior Renovation Project addresses interior renovation and upgrades systems and spaces to improve a variety of issues including abatement of hazardous materials including asbestos and lead paint, mechanical system upgrades, electrical system upgrades, modernization of tenant spaces, ADA upgrades including restrooms, and progressive collapse upgrades.  Also included in the Interior Renovation Project is the renovation and replacement of the façade on the first floor, construction of entries / lobbies / plazas and vertical transportation.  Construction will be in multiple phases as tenants are relocated to provide vacant floors for each phase (the government plans to vacate two to three floors to allow for construction and anticipates the project will include four phases, with construction lasting no longer than 4 years). Total construction costs including all phases are estimated at $35,000,000 to $50,000,000.  

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor: or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer, GSA's A-E firm, as well as other GSA consultants. (NOTE: A-E firm has been selected but no contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.) Proposal Submission Requirements: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202). Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM) and factors identified in the RFP. All information submitted concerning a joint venture should clearly identify roles and responsibilities within the joint venture.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Stage I RFP. 

The evaluation criteria elements for Stage I are as follows:  Past Performance as Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc), or Traditional General Contractor (360 points); Past Performance with Preconstruction Phase Services on Similar Projects (180 points); Past Performance for CMc or General Contractor within the Greater Des Moines, Iowa Area (120 points); Qualifications and Experience of the Four (4) Key Personnel (160 points); Experience in the Greater Des Moines Area with General Construction and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects (150 points); Experience in Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (20 points); Experience with Building Owner as Full Partner (20 points); Experience with Value Engineering  (20 points); CMc’s Use of Current Project Management Technology (20 points); and Project Specific Knowledge (50 points).  

Stage I Request for Proposals will be issued on or about December 6, 2004.  The Government will evaluate Stage I of the RFP submissions to identify and advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the Stage I of the RFP, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the next stage of the acquisition. 

The evaluation criteria elements for Stage II are as follows:  Project Management Staffing Plan (40 points); CMc’s Remaining Qualification and Experience of Key Personnel (170 points); Quality Control Plan (20 points); Network Analysis Schedule (40 points); Safety Plan (20 points); Track and Control Costs (20 points); Processing Correspondence/Dealing with Issues (20 points); Utilization of “Sustainable” Methods and Materials (20 points); and Oral Presentation (50 points).  Offerors must submit a Detailed Project Management Plan, Oral Presentation, Price Proposals and Subcontracting Plans under Stage II of the RFP. All Stage II respondents shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for all subcontracted work: 39% for Small Business (SB) which includes 3% for HUBZone Small Business (HZSB), 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5% for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) that includes 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Fiscal Year 2004. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. (Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.) Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13. FAR Clause 52.219-4 - Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply. Offers from Small disadvantaged business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.12. FAR Clause 52.219-23 - Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns shall apply. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the evaluation of the Stage II submittals without holding discussions.  Pre-Construction Services are anticipated to be awarded the summer of 2005.  Options for Construction Phase Services will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CMc contractor’s performance is satisfactory.   Pre-Proposal Conference: A Pre-Proposal conference is planned for mid December.  The actual date and time will be included in the next FedBizOpps announcement.  Persons with disabilities needing auxiliary aid should make their request for auxiliary aid to the Contracting Officer at least 2 weeks prior to the date of the pre-proposal meeting.

The solicitation (specifications) and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisitions related information (specifications) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.  

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 1. Your Company’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company’s CCR Point of Contact, 2. Your Company’s DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code, 3. Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 4. Your Telephone Number, and 5. Your E-Mail Address.  Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to Register with FEDTeDS and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official plan holders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FEDTeDS.

The Request for Proposals Stage 1 will be available by link via the Solicitation on or about December 6, 2004.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to release an RFP to fulfill the need for customized Dive Trailers. The purpose of the Dive Trailer is to provide a single, transportable unit capable of fully supporting all aspects of the diving operations. The trailer must also serve as a self-contained Diving Locker for all operations. The following is a summary of the draft requirements:  The trailer should be designed to fit and be secured inside a C-130 aircraft and be towed by a Ford E-350 fifteen passenger van (maximum towing capacity of 9,000lbs; estimated cargo weight 4,000lbs). Maximum dimensions are 252 inches long by 104 inches wide by 96 inches high. All the equipment inside the trailer must be capable of being sufficiently stabilized and secured for air travel. Due to the inherently wet environment the trailer will be used in, all materials should be non-corrosive. Flooring should be durable and water resistant. The floor should have adequate anchor points to tie additional equipment down with standard cargo straps during transport.  Interior walls should be coated with vinyl or some other water resistant coating. The interior of the side door should be surfaced with a dry erase board as large as possible. A generator is needed to provide adequate interior and exterior lighting and a heating and air conditioning capability. The generator should be mounted externally to optimize internal capacity. Due to the wet environment the trailer will be used in, all electrical outlets must be protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). Wherever possible (awning, stabilizer jacks, etc.) electric systems should be used instead of manual systems. An environmental control system is required to enable all weather operations and maintain a dry atmosphere in the trailer. The charging station requires sufficient electrical outlets to charge six devices. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The request information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. We anticipate posting the RFP within the month of March.  Please reference Reference-Number-HSCG23-05-R-TRAILER!!

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Titan Corporation of San Diego, CA. for acquisition of the production of selected components that comprise the backfit kits for LCACs that underwent the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) prior to development of the C4N Reliability Improvement Program (RIP). NSWC-PC is the Systems Integration Agent (SIA), In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), Technical Support Activity (TSA) and Software Support Activity in support of the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation (C4N) program.  This requirement is for acquisition of the following components required to improve the reliability of the LCAC C4N systems. The initial acquisition will be for two (2) sets of the components with options for an additional twenty nine (29) sets. The components are: Navigation Processor (one per set), Universal Keyboard (UKB) Pro! cessor (one per set), IP based Common Data Recorder (one per set), Redundant Ethernet Switch Assembly (one per set), 4x4 UKB Keypad (one per set), Operator Display Panel (ODP) (one per set).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  These components were uniquely designed by Titan Corporation for the LCAC C4N RIP and are not commercially available. Titan Corporation also built the first prototypes for testing. The prototype RIP hardware has undergone environmental qualification testing (EQT) in the 1st Qtr of FY04 and Titan is currently refining the design based on the results of these tests.  The items being procured are required to be compatible with existing LCAC equipment.  The RIP equipment specified above is 100% compatible with the existing LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) equipment.  Software (embedded operating systems, operational flight software and offline diagnostics) has been developed and tested with th! e new RIP hardware configuration.  Maintenance and operator training have also been developed for the LCAC C4N RIP configuration as well.  Technical manual updates are being performed to match the new RIP hardware configuration.    Therefore it is in the Government’s best interest to purchase the equipment from Titan Corporation that will allow for re-use of the developed software, training and qualified hardware as well as being compatible with other existing C4N equipment. While drawings were developed for the equipment they are insufficiently detailed at this point to support competitive acquisition of the components.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives that the government has long applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, who will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  As such, CMS anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the Durable Medical Equipment – Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME-MAC).  

The DME-MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies.  In addition to the core DME-MAC workload, CMS anticipates including several optional services to be performed.  Optional services include functions related to national supplier enrollment, data analysis and coding and Enterprise Data Center (EDC) services.  It is anticipated that the competition will result in award of four DME-MAC contracts.  CMS also anticipates that each contract will be a “stand-alone” contract. Each contract will include a base year and four, one-year options.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Cathy Baldwin, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-5791, or by sending e-mail to CBaldwin@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) in late March 2005.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Eng. Raz Mohammad Alami, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Transportation c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Aviation Law and Regulatory Framework TA in Afghanistan.  The Ministry of Transportation of Afghanistan invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on an aviation law and regulatory framework project in Afghanistan.  The proposed legal and regulatory assistance will help the Ministry to update the current aviation law.  The updated law should create a civil aviation authority with adequate personnel, resources and powers and should define the roles and responsibilities of the Government of Afghanistan, Ariana Afghan Airlines and other Afghan carriers, foreign operators and other stakeholders.  The assistance supported by this grant will help the Ministry of Transportation to develop its civil aviation sector and will contribute to improved aviation safety and security.  This project will be conducted in close coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration’s assistance to Afghanistan.  

The current civil aviation law, written in 1982, lacks the proper regulatory framework to redevelop a safe, secure and sustainable civil aviation sector in Afghanistan.  Although the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, which was merged into the Ministry of Transportation in late 2004, agreed in 2003 to develop a new civil aviation law, the law has not moved forward.  As such, the Ministry of Transportation has requested assistance to help them enact an effective aviation law.   
 
The updated law should create a civil aviation authority (CAA) with adequate personnel, resources, and powers necessary to effectively oversee civil aviation and led by a Director charged with carrying out the authority of the CAA.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $309,705 grant to the Ministry of Transportation from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Afghanistan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to the Ministry of Transportation c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. March 28, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Ministry of Transportation (Ministry) reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Ministry also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Ministry is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The NIST Acquisition Management Division intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) with T-VEC Technologies, Inc, 2214 Rock Hill Road, Herndon, VA  20170.  

The current requirement is for the development of FIPS 201 conformance testing methodology and associated proof of concept toolkit for the Government Smart Card Interoperability Specification (GSC-IS) Version 2.1 to fully meet the requirements of NIST Special Publication specification SP800-73.v1.0, Integrated Circuit Card for Personal Identify Verification by June 2005.  Specific tasks consist of the following:

(1)	Service Module 1:  Formal Modeling of Functions and Development of Conformance Tests for testing all functions in GSC-IS Version 2.1. (Functions in GSC-IS v2.1 form 90% of the functions in the Interoperability Specification SP 800-73.
(2)	Service Module 2: Formal Modeling of Functions and Development of Conformance Tests for testing all functions in specification SP 800-73 not found in GSC-IS Version 2.1 (10% of all functions in Interoperability Specification SP 800-73).

(3)	Service Module 3:  Formal Modeling and Functions and Development of Conformance Tests for testing all functions in FIPS 201 document not found in SP 800-73.

This is a follow-on requirement to the original effort which was successfully completed under the competitively awarded contract, SB1341-04-W-0718, to T-VEC Technologies for the development of a toolkit for conformance testing of the GSC-IS Version 2.1.    The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation would incur substantial duplication of cost and effort to the Government that cannot be expected to be recovered through competition and result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. 

The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541511 and the size standard is 500.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing.  The Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A Request for Quotation is not available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under the authority of the The Best Pharmaceuticals Act (BPCA), has a requirement for a study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and effectiveness of oral azithromycin for treatment of infants diagnosed with or at risk of being infected with Chlamydia trachomatis (C.trachomatis.)  These Studies shall conform to the specifications that will be contained in the Request for Proposals (RFP) and the final protocol approved by the NICHD.  These Studies shall also be required to conform to all applicable Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for research conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND.)

The overall scope of this requirement will be to:  (1) study oral azithromycin PK in infants less than four months of age who are diagnosed with C.trachomatis pneumonia or conjunctivitis, (2) determine the feasibility of a treatment study comparing the efficacy of azithromycin to erythromycin in this group of infants less than four months of age, and to (3) determine the feasibility of a prevention study comparing oral azithromycin to placebo in infants less than two weeks of age who are at risk of developing C.trachomatis infection.  It is estimated that a minimum of 48 subjects may be required over a three-year period of performance to conduct the study.

The Contractor will be required to enroll a minimum of 16 patients per year per dose level of oral azithromycin for the single and multiple dose PK studies in the infants less than four months of age who are diagnosed with C.trachomatis pneumonia or conjunctivitis.

The results of the single and multiple dose PK Studies will be used to support the FDA pediatric labeling of oral azithromycin for C.trachomatis.  In addition, the data provided will be used to derive PK information, safety and tolerability as set forth in the FDA Written Request that will be contained in the RFP.

Currently, the NICHD has awarded contracts for several other BPCA drug studies, including a contract for a BPCA Coordinating Center.  Additional information on BPCA and NICHD can be found at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/oppb/bpca/index.htm.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about March 14, 2005.  The proposals will be due 60 days after the issue date.  

Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Paul J. Duska, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to evaluate Youth Transition Demonstration (YTD) Projects.  In order to better understand how to support individuals with disabilities in reaching their full economic potential, SSA has initiated a multi-faceted research agenda to test strategies to best identify how individuals with disabilities can become self-sufficient and less reliant on SSI/CDB benefits.  SSA has awarded cooperative agreements to seven project sites in six states to begin this work.  These projects will work with youth aged 14-25 who receive SSI, or Childhood Disability Benefits and those at risk of receiving such benefits, including those who have a progressive disability, who have a prognosis for decreased functioning, or who have existing disabling conditions prior to age 18 that would make them eligible for benefits except for deemed parental income.  SSA awarded a contract for technical assistance (TA) and training (Virginia Commonwealth University - VCU) to be provided to the YTD Cooperative Agreement grantees.  The evaluation contractor shall work with the TA contractor to closely monitor the progress of the development and implementation of changes in the interventions in order to provide feedback and recommendations for corrective action, and maintain project work plan goals and time lines.  Through this requirement for evaluation, SSA will develop and evaluate strategies that maximize the economic self-sufficiency of youth with disabilities as they transition from school to work.  This research will generate empirical evidence, based on both process and random-assignment evaluations, on the impacts of SSI waivers and enhanced coordination of services for youth with disabilities.  Under this project, SSA will test the effectiveness of altering certain SSI rules as an incentive to encourage recipients with disabilities or blindness to initiate work or increase their work activity and to increase their earnings.  The evaluation design of these YTD strategies will include a process evaluation of all existing and additional project sites involved, and will yield important information in understanding how to assist youth in the transition process.  In addition, those sites who are interested in random assignment will also participate in an impact analysis.  The contractor shall conduct full implementation/process evaluations with each project site involved in the project, and based upon the development of each project site, move forward with a random assignment design at specified locations, in order to determine the impacts of each program.  The evaluation will measure the impacts of SSI waivers and enhanced coordination services intended to promote the economic self-sufficiency of youth with disabilities, and will test overall strategies to improving the employment, educational, school and income outcomes of youth with disabilities as they transition from school to work.   The three components of this evaluation include a process, impact, and cost-benefit analysis.  The evaluation contractor will work with the existing seven YTD project sites, as well as recommend 2 – 4 additional sites through this contract mechanism.  The responsibilities of the YTD Evaluation Contractor shall include: 1) recommendation of 2 – 4 additional sites through visits, marketing the project, and technical assistance; 2) providing technical assistance to sites on evaluation design, strategy, and implementation; coordinating with national technical assistance contractor (VCU); 3) monitoring pilot tests on project sites; 4) assisting in final site selection for evaluation sites; 5) developing and implementing final evaluation design; 6) convening conferences and meetings in conjunction with the TA contractor; 7) collecting administrative and program intervention data; 8) developing and administering surveys; 9) conducting a process and impact study of program findings; 10) conducting a cost benefit analysis of the project; 11) producing research and analysis on special topics relating  to the project; 12) producing public use data files and documentation; disseminating findings and conducting briefings; and 13) producing reports.  SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract with a nine (9) year period of performance.  The NAICS code is 624110, with a size standard of $6 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-05-1025, is scheduled for release on or about March 11, 2005.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Qualification Statement has been revised and issued 512582-05-A-0002 rev1 includes previous listed changes and corrects tab numbering errors and raises emr to 1.0. 
The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification of design/build firms. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify design/build on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified firms by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested design/build firms must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: Design/Build (3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 40 million, $40 to 100 million, $100 million and above. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified design/build firms in each of the defined geographical areas. 

The Postal Service will select the most qualified design/build firms utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Design/build firms that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.  A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million.

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of one (1) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects over $100 million. 

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution. For projects over $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution or other projects of similar or greater complexity - New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the design builder are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.

Prequalified design/build firms will be automatically notified for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. The solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its’ sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Firms shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firm’s prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness. 

A preproposal meeting will be held at 9:00 am on February 22, 2005 at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.
 
Qualification packages are available now and may be obtained by email request to Bill Powell at bill.powell@usps.gov or Tim Bonsall at tbonsall@email.usps.gov or written request to either at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840. You also may FAX your request to either at 703-526-2747. Qualification Statements are due March 08, 2005 by 3:00 P.M. EST.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 01 to BAA05-09 is to clarify the following: 

The purpose of the Phase 1 goals in this program is to convey confidence to DARPA that you will be able to meet the Phase 2 goals. The purpose of the Phase 2 goals is to convince DARPA and others that your approach will be a very low risk one in going from a 10 kW demo to a 100 kW system. Therefore, be sure to structure the technology demo efforts in your program so that you clearly address the main risk items in scaling your technololgy from one phase to the next, especially power density, and power per unit bandwidth. For example, if you are proposing spectral beam combining as the approach to use in scaling to 100 kW within 50 nm, the Phase 2 goal should be to produce a 10 kW beam having a spectral bandwidth of 5 nm.

Request for Proposals (RFP) (Stage I Technical Proposals) for the Interior Renovation of the Federal Building, 210 Walnut, Des Moines, IA. 

The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the proposed Interior Renovation of the Federal Building located in Des Moines, Iowa. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. A Fixed-Price contract under FAR 16.202-1 is contemplated. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). 

Project Summary: The Federal Building is located at 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa. The project consists of approximately 390,000 gross square feet while containing approximately 263,500 occupiable square feet.  Approximately forty federal agencies occupy the Federal Building.  Another project is presently underway and involves the Repair and Alteration of the facade of floors 2 through 10, including the penthouse and roof.  The exterior facade replacement project addresses air and water infiltration though the building envelope, and is expected to be complete January 2005.  The Interior Renovation Project addresses interior renovation and upgrades systems and spaces to improve a variety of issues including abatement of hazardous materials including asbestos and lead paint, mechanical system upgrades, electrical system upgrades, modernization of tenant spaces, ADA upgrades including restrooms, and progressive collapse upgrades.  Also included in the Interior Renovation Project is the renovation and replacement of the facade on the first floor, construction of entries / lobbies / plazas and vertical transportation.  Construction will be in multiple phases as tenants are relocated to provide vacant floors for each phase (the government plans to vacate two to three floors to allow for construction and anticipates the project will include four phases, with construction lasting no longer than 4 years). Total construction costs including all phases are estimated at $35,000,000 to $50,000,000.  

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor: or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer, GSAs A-E firm, as well as other GSA consultants. (NOTE: A-E firm has been selected but no contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.) 

Proposal Submission Requirements: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202). Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM) and factors identified in the RFP.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) is conducting a market survey to determine industries capabilities to provide Modular Non-Live Fire MOUT Capabilities.

The scope of the effort entails performing a mix of design, fabrication, installation, integration, verification and fielding of the Non-Live Fire MOUT.   Extensive studies by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory has shown that units trained to operate an integrated combined arms team are more successful within the urban battle space and suffer fewer casualties.  With this in mind and given the nature of operations in support of OIF the requirement to train Battalion sized forces is critical.  This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world operations in Iraq.  Facilities are required in order for the Marine Corps to conduct quality and credible battalion level force-on-force SASO and/or MOUT training.   The Non-Live Fire MOUT Facilities will primarily be used for company and battalion force-on-force fire and maneuver training using SESAMs ammunition and MILES gear within an urban terrain facility.

As part of this RFI, the Marine Corps System Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS), releases a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Systems Requirements Document for Industry comment.  Interested vendors should supply comments to the documents indicating ability to meet specified requirements, specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposal.  Received comments will be considered by the Government for basis of modification to the subject documents.  Comments will not be directly responded to but may be addressed collectively at a future date during or prior to solicitation.  These documents and all future documents are available for download from the PM TRASYS website, Business Opportunities Division at: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/trasys/trasysweb.nsf/ 

This request for comment in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  All interested potential offerors shall submit an email request to Mr. Fred Boehne and Lt. Col. Greg Caldwell to be placed on bidders list for future correspondence and documentation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The closing date and time for receipt of proposals is Monday, March 7, 2005 at 10:00AM ET (local time), 1111 20th Street; Room 4414; Washington, DC  20526; Attn:  Jennifer Shell, Contracting Officer, (202) 692-1713.  The NAICS Code is 813920 and the small business size standard is $6,000,000.  The solicitation number is PC-05-R-005 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Peace Corps intends to award a firm fixed price contract to be completed within 5 months of award.  The Peace Corps Language Proficiency Interview (PC LPI) is an important assessment tool used by all Peace Corps’ posts around the world to evaluate the speaking ability of Trainees before they become volunteers, during their service, and at the end of their stay in-country. The interview is closely modeled by the ACTFL OPI and uses the ACTFL Guidelines as the assessment criteria. With this testing Peace Corps responds to the Congressional Mandate (1961) that “No persons shall be assigned to duty as volunteers in any foreign country or area unless at the time of such assignment they possess such reasonable proficiency as their assignment requires in speaking the language of the country or area to which they are assigned.”  The training materials used are being upgraded in order to present consistently high quality of training to all posts in English, French and Spanish, as well as to reflect Peace Corps’ identity and mission in connection to the language teaching program.  The new materials must follow the PC LPI protocol, and offer optimal samples of testing techniques. The ratings of the new recordings should correspond to the new ACTFL Guidelines (revised in 1999 and available on the Internet) and to the structure and protocol Peace Corps teaches, as described in the new workshop Manual (now in preparation and available to the successful contractor). The goal is to use these new materials to assist the field in the preparation of better qualified testers who will then administer more accurate testing programs.  The contractor shall:  1) Create a maximum of 15 hours, minimum of 10 hours, of new digital videos of valid sample interviews for training in the PC LPI Workshop in Spanish, English, and French (10 interviews each = 30 interviews) Maximum length of each interview: 30 minutes; maximum total recording per language: 5 hours.  A VHS copy of the video should be included; 2) Create a maximum of 15 hours, minimum of 10 hours, of new master digital audio recordings in Spanish, English and French for the PC LPI practice cassettes that accompany the Workshop Manual (10 interviews each = 30 interviews) Maximum length of each interview: 30 minutes; maximum total recording per language: 5 hours; 3) Create new master digital audio recordings in Spanish, English, and French for the workshop testing (5 interviews each = 15 interviews) ratings shall require final approval from Peace Corps. Maximum length of each interview: 30 minutes; 4) Collateral Materials - The contractor will include a rationale for rating of each interview in writing. It should describe each interview in terms of structure and evaluation.  All documents should be print-ready and delivered on disk in PC MS Word format so that Peace Corps may edit the materials for size or content when necessary.    The target audience of the program is the language testers and teachers from Peace Corps at posts in more than 70 countries. Many in this audience are second language learners of English, Spanish or French, or speak a particular regional dialect that will make the American pronunciation a foreign language. Therefore, clarity in pronunciation and recording is particularly important.  Testers and interviewees in the recordings should represent a diversified group in terms of gender, age, and ethnic background. While interviewees may be repeated in different languages, a variety of testers should be used for each language collection.  While interviewees must be selected so that all proficiency levels are represented in the master, the preference choice of testers should be guided by their experience as proficiency testers. All testers must be ACTFL Tester certified in order to conduct the testing.  Due to the time-sensitive nature of the final products, deadlines will be a critical aspect of this contract.  These recordings must be developed in high quality and content so that the materials can service the multicultural and international audiences of Peace Corps, and remain applicable for many years to come. Applicability is defined in the following categories: Quality of the interviews: 1) Clear structure, easily ratable content; 2) Length of each interview will vary according to the level. No interview should be longer than 30 minutes; 3) Quality of recording should be of the best quality available, with clear voices and clear pronunciation, no background sounds, and without static or background “rain”; 4) Second rated and reviewed for structure requirements, topic choices, quality of recording; 5) Quality assurance by blind second rating to certify that each interview rating corresponds to the appropriate level in the ACTFL Guideline.  Choice of topics of conversation: 1) Culturally appropriate/universal; 2) Material should not make reference to dated events that will mark the recording as done in 2005 (no references to recent events, films or dates); 3) Peace Corps oriented; 4) Politically correct: no reference to name of functionaries that may change, or issues that may offend or surprise other cultures (i.e. abortion, gun control, etc); 5) Internationally oriented so that the international audience will understand (no particular references to local American culture such as video games, dating among youngsters, college life, etc); 6) No reference to controversial or sensitive topics that may offend a conservative international audience (religion, sex preferences, euthanasia, etc); 7) Topics should be rich and interesting, and serve as good suggestions for testers. The variation of topics should be present from one interview to the other so that the recordings are not repetitive, since all will be heard in a short period of time by the same audience.  Peace Corps has final authorization of all topics.  Other Requirements: 1) Interview evaluation form will be provided as evaluation guide provided by Peace Corps to the successful contractor; 2)  Signed release from both interviewer and interviewee that allows Peace Corps to use the recordings indefinitely; 3) Final revision by the Language Testing Specialist at Peace Corps.  Masters will be cut individually for each interview and labeled accordingly. Video recording should be done with a minimum of two cameras. Final master should be on one compact video disk and VHS tape per language. Audio recordings should be delivered in digital master only.  Final digital audio master should be delivered divided by language per disk. Testing recordings should be separate from practice tapes. Ratings should not appear on the recording. The rationale/description (see Collateral Material) should include the final ratings of the interviews.  Anticipated Masters Delivery Date:  Contractor will shoot interviews June 2005 through July 2005.  Final digital audio deliverable by July 25th, 2005. Digital and VHS video masters deliverable by August 29th, 2005.  The delivery address for all deliverables is:  Peace Corps, 1111 20th Street; Washington, DC  20526.  Review Process: The Contractor shall perform edits and submit final copy to the Peace Corps for review and approval before approved deadline.  The final version of video recording must be submitted for review in two formats: one DVD and one VHS.  The final version of audio recordings must be submitted for review in one format: CD.  All delivered recordings must be reviewed and approved by Peace Corps prior to final acceptance.  Legal Requirements: The Contractor will ensure that all copyrights, waivers and other legal requirements are met regarding the rights of Peace Corps to use the recordings in perpetuity, with unlimited rights.  The Contractor may be required, at no additional cost to the government, to perform one major revision and one minor revision of individual deliverables before Peace Corps representatives accept a final version.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Non-Personal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price performance based commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-05-022-BAC to acquire Podiatry Services for the Wind River Service Unit located on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Ft. Washakie, Wyoming.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-26. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621391 and the small business size standard is $8.5 million. PRICE SCHEDULE:  Offers should be submitted for the BASE YEAR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________.  Clinics will be scheduled four days per month between the hours of 8:00am and 4:45pm at the Ft. Washakie and Arapahoe Clinics.  The proposal must be inclusive of transportation, food, and lodging.  This procurement is a non-personal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment).  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.  The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned.  The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES:  Will provide podiatry services in general clinic.  The contractor shall provide on-site services for a podiatry clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physicians/ providers at the Wind River Service Unit.  The contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, two days per month between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming two days per month between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm.  During each clinic the contractor will see up to 15 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Centers.  The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination.  The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings.  The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient’s medical chart or in the Electronic Health  Record.  The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management.  Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government.  Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change.  The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government.  The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician.  In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Non-Personal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price performance based commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-05-023-BAC to acquire Orthopedic Services for the Wind River Service Unit located on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Ft. Washakie, Wyoming.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-26. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $8.5 million. PRICE SCHEDULE:  Offers should be submitted for the BASE YEAR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________.  Clinics will be scheduled four days per month between the hours of 12:45pm and 4:45pm at the Ft. Washakie and Arapahoe Clinics.  The proposal must be inclusive of transportation, food, and lodging.  This procurement is a non-personal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment).  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.  The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned.  The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES:  Contractor will provide orthopedic services in general clinic.  The contractor shall provide on-site services for an orthopedic clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physician/providers at the Wind River Service Unit.  The contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every week between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 12:45 pm and 4:45 pm.  During each clinic the contractor will see up to 24 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center.  The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination.  The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings.  The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient’s medical chart or in the Electronic Health Record.  The written consultation shall include the findings, impressions, and recommendations about the management.   The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory and x-ray services, and pharmacy services.  Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government.  Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change.  The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government.  The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician.  In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.  
This contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services.  All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter.   PERFORMANCE-BASED

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Non-Personal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price performance based commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-05-025-BAC to acquire Obstetrics Services for the Wind River Service Unit located on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Ft. Washakie, Wyoming.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-26. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $8.5 million. PRICE SCHEDULE:  Offers should be submitted for the BASE YEAR: 104 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 104 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 104 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 104 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 104 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________.  Clinics will be scheduled four/five days per month between the hours of 8:00am and 12:00pm at the Ft. Washakie Clinic and four/five days per month between the hours of 8:00am and 12:00pm at the Arapahoe Clinic.  The proposal must be inclusive of transportation, food, and lodging.  This procurement is a non-personal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment).  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.  The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned.  The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES:  Contractor provide obstetric services in general clinic.  The contractor shall provide on site services for an obstetrics clinic to outpatients scheduled by Government physicians/ providers at the Wind River Service Unit.  The contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am to 12:00 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am and 12:00pm.   During each clinic the contractor will see up to 18 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center.  The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination.  The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings.  The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient’s medical chart or in the Electronic Health Record.  The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management.  The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services.  Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government.  Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change.  The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government.  The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician.  In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.  
The contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services.  All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter.  PERFORMANCE-BASED CONTRACTING:  Performance-based contracting methods are intended to ensure that required performance quality levels are achieved and that total payment is related to the degree that services performed meet contract standards.

1.  Where is the training being held? 

On-site training must be included in contractor’s proposal.  The Government anticipates that the training will last for two days.  This training should occur NLT one calendar month from delivery of the equipment.   There will be four individuals that will be available to attend the training, that is to be held at Ft. Meade, MD..

2.  Will the training be on-site for software and projectors together?

Yes.  The projectors are "smart".  They have on-board operating systems which need to be taught, as well as, the PJNet Software for maintenance and control.  This all works together as one big system, so it must be taught at the same time.

3.  Does the Government need Planet Software?

This software is not required.

4.  Can they send training software, rather than appear at Ft Meade?

No.  Training must be on site.

5.  Do we need to purchase PJ Net Software?

Yes, but only ONE copy is necessary, NOT one for each projector.   

6.  Is there a separate P/N for each of the following:  Ceiling Mount and Bracket?

No, only one part number is required - RPA213.  This number, according to the manufacturer website, includes both the SLB and RPA brackets.  


7.  Is the Software license for one projector or a separate software package for 80 projectors.

This is for the server/controlling computer only, thus only one copy is required.   These are networked systems (one network) rather than stand alone projectors/smaller, multiple networks.   

8.  Zip Code for Ft Meade?

The complete “ship to” Zip Code is  20755-5620

9.  Is installation labor required for each projector?

No, the Government shall be responsible for installation of the projectors.

10.  Can GSA pricing be provided as their quote?

Yes, you may provide GSA pricing.

Based on the above, we have extended the bid opening until 2:00 p.m. Pacific time on 3 Mar 2005.  

If you have already submitted a quote, please verify if it is correct…or make necessary changes and re-submit.

This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
