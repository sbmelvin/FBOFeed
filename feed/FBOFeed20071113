<DESC>Amendment to E9919070062 for Solicitation N9919070062 (11/8/07). Notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Drake Construction Inc., 116 2nd Ave, Kotzebue, AK 99752.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and supplies necessary to perform demolition and removal of an approximately 32'6" by 48'10" two story building and provide a 34'6" x 50'10" x 1' gravel cap, on Tract A, Block 11, Lot 3, Kotzebue, Alaska, owned by the Western Arctic National Park and Preserve (WEAR). Under authority of FAR 6.302-5, the value of the contract is expected to be under $100,000.00. Geographic location:  Kotzebue is located on the Baldwin Peninsula in Kotzebue Sound, 549 air miles northwest of Anchorage and 26 miles above the Arctic Circle. Population: 3,120; Access: There are no roads connecting Kotzebue to the rest of the state.  There is barge service beginning in late June/early July which ends in mid-September.  There is daily jet service from Anchorage via Nome; and air taxi service to other villages in the region. Accommodations: One motel (76 rooms), two bed and breakfasts; three restaurants; Weather: Temperatures from October through April vary between 10 degrees above and 30 degrees below zero. These temperatures do not include the wind-chill factor which has on occasion reached 100 below. Area rivers begin freezing early in October; break-up occurs late in May or early June. During the winter months, ice in the Kotzebue Sound freezes to a depth of approximately five feet. The Sound may remain frozen into the second week of June.  Snow generally falls in every month of the year except July and August. The total for a normal year is 8 inches.  Cyclonic storms are frequent, especially from October to April, and many of them are accompanied by high winds and blizzard conditions during the winter months. The absence of pronounced sheltering terrain results in unimpeded air movement throughout the year.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for safety and fire services to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?s (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) in accomplishing its institutional safety program objectives.  NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 12-month contract extension to MEI Technologies, Inc.  This extension will allow for the continuation of services for NASA from October 01, 2008 to March 31, 2009 with six 1-month extensions through September 30, 2009.  While the extension is in effect, NASA will compete this effort with award of a new contract estimated to take place on or before October 01, 2009.  The Contractor will perform safety, fire protection, training, maintenance of fire protection systems, and special projects. The Contractor will specifically support the JSC Safety and Test Operations Division whose mission is to help line management and employees in reducing and preventing injuries to NASA personnel and damage to NASA equipment.  The Safety and Test Operations Division with support from the Safety and Fire Services (SFS) Contract provides guidance and help as needed, ensures that line management is fulfilling its safety responsibilities, and maintains JSC fire protection systems. Work includes consultation, audits, surveys, inspection, training, management reviews, engineering analysis, and other safety related documentation.	 The primary work areas for this contract are aerospace facilities at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, and related operations at Ellington Field (EF), Houston, Texas, and Sonny Carter Training Facility (SCTF), Houston, Texas.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from MEI Technologies, Inc., from October 01, 2008 through March 31, 2009 with six 1-month options through September 30, 2009. The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time in its best interests, since the period of performance for this extension is only 6 months with six 1-month options that may or may not be exercised.  The phase-in costs and time involved in transitioning to a new contractor and establishing relationships with the various affected parties, for this short period, would far outweigh any cost savings achieved through competition.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 20, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

We expect that multiple awards will be issued, with a down selection to a single design with the selected performer having the  opportunity to develop and demonstrate the Information Architecture as part of the S&RL Program. Inherent in the design will be the capability to integrate / demonstrate multiple components either from existing USMC logistics systems or S&T products developed under separate contract.
The program goal is to develop and demonstrate a flexible, distributed ?systems of systems? networked architecture - both hardware and software - capable of providing measurable advances in logistics Planning, Decision, Execution, and Assessment (PDE&A) functions. 

The following are the main Products Areas for the S&RL program. These products are listed to provide potential offerors insight into the scope of the overall S&RL program focus areas and technical efforts needed to address them for this solicitation.  The products should transition into Programs of Record (PORs) such as Global Combat Support System ? Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) or Autonomic Logistics (AL) baseline in technology spirals for early transition.

Part of a mesh network infrastructure monitoring equipment health, operating status, location, and state to LRU level.  Smart sensor and signal processing algorithms for a variety of sensors capable of maximizing knowledge extraction at the point of collection and minimizing the bandwidth needed to propagate information (knowledge would be forwarded if deemed useful by the processing algorithm).

Intelligence Agent Technologies ? Capability to accurately assess platform health, usage, and remaining useful life for disparate equipment/system types.  Component level, system level, platform level, and enterprise level prognostics models that function in an open, distributed network environment.  Agents that generate ontologies based on correlation between unit tactical compositions, mission requirements and logistic resources required to sustain operational tempo. Emergent behaviors are quantified and leveraged in an adaptive environment.

Predictive and Adaptive Fuels Management Tool ? Planning and decision support tools to improve battlefield fuel management (options generator for dynamic allocation, automated status and location, platform consumption forecasting, rate of usage).  

Decision Support Tools ? Capability for performing predictive planning, adaptive analysis of evolving environments, real time dynamic updates, data analysis and courses of action development based on Commander?s intent.  Automated tasking and assessment tools for accurately determining measures of effectiveness. 

Numbered Notes:
13.  The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award.

<u>Proposal Submission Place:</u>
Mr. M. Aitkulov, Deputy General Director
National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan
JSC, 326, Jibek Jolu, 720070, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
Phone: +996 (312) 66 10 05, Fax: +996 (312) 66 06 56

<b><u>Kyrgyzstan - Datka-Kemin 500 kV Transmission Line Feasibility Study </u></b>
National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan JSC (NEGK) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to determine the technical and economic feasibility of constructing a new 400 km, 500 kV power transmission line from the Datka 500 kV substation in southwest Kyrgyzstan to a new 500 kV substation at Kemin in north - east Kyrgyzstan.  

Endowed with significant hydropower resources, Kyrgyzstan is a net exporter of electricity, primarily to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China. Exports amount to nearly 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year.  Kyrgyzstan also has the potential to export power to South Asia, assuming that the 500kV Central Asia - South Asia power line is built.  However, Kyrgyzstan's energy sector is facing serious technical problems and capacity constraints, as the Kyrgyz system is old and antiquated, and winter electricity demand is twice that of pre-independence years due to growth in residential electric heating loads.  

At the present time, 90% of Kyrgyzstan's power is produced in hydropower stations in southern Kyrgyzstan, while the main load centers of usage of electric power are in northern Kyrgyzstan, with the capital city of Bishkek and the concentration of industry located in this part of the country.  Electricity is transmitted from southern Kyrgyzstan to northern Kyrgyzstan primarily on one 500 kV line.  Due to the heavy dependence of Kyrgyzstan on electric power for residential heating, in the winter this line is overloaded.  The only alternate transmission path is through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, involving a longer route and leading to security issues for reliable power supply and excessive wheeling charges.

In order to alleviate the overloading of the existing 500 kV line and eliminate the need for transmission through Uzbekistan, NEGK is planning to build an additional 500 kV transmission line from southern Kyrgyzstan to northern Kyrgyzstan.  The routing of the line would allow interconnection with the Datka substation, the Kambarata Hydroelectric power station and the grid in northern Kyrgyzstan on the east side of Bishkek.  This would alleviate overloading on the 220 kV lines in the north.

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study includes:

Task A - Confirm/Revise Draft Work Plan;
Task B - Collect Available Data;
Task C - Identify Alternative Rights of Way;
Task D - Select Optimum Right of Way;
Task E - Establish Line Capacity and Electrical Dynamics;
Task F - Specify Transmission Line Design;
Task G - Establish Bill of Materials and Equipment Specifications;
Task H - Prepare Preliminary Environmental and Development Impact Analyses;
Task I - Estimate Project Capital and Operating Costs;
Task J - Identify the Ownership Structure;
Task K - Conduct Financial and Sensitivity Analyses; and
Task L - Prepare Final Report.
  
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $537,595 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  NEGK reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  NEGK also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. NEGK is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>99--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) - Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) for Metallic Materials
<SOLNBR>6158
<RESPDATE>022908
<CONTACT>Karen Mercer, (609) 485-6747
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-08-0002 Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) For Metallic Materials *****The FAA will host the Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) meeting on November 15, 2007 starting at 9:00am.  The RCDT BAA meeting is to be held at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center.  Attendees are required to contact Felix Abali (609 485-7549, abali.abali@faa.gov) by November 5 to register for the meeting and to obtain additional meeting detailed information.***** 1. Background The FAA is currently considering the damage tolerance requirement for rotorcraft structures and dynamic components.  While the damage tolerance methodology has been extensively and successfully used in fix-wing aircraft structures, rotorcraft has just begun to use it in addition to the safe-life approach.  Generally, safe-life, in flight hours, is experimentally determined using the mission profile, flight loads, and S-N data.  Using Miner's cumulative fatigue damage rule, a fatigue damage rate for each flight condition is typically calculated by assessing the damaging load cycles per hour from the flight spectrum and loads data, the ratio of the alternating load to the endurance limit, and the cycles-to-failure from a standard component S-N curve.  A reciprocal summation of each fatigue damage rate for each flight condition then determines the retirement life of the part being analyzed. In contrast to safe-life, the damage tolerance (DT) approach assumes that an inherent flaw or crack exists in the manufactured part.  The life of the part is determined using fracture mechanics methodologies, load spectrum, manufacturing process and operating environment.  Based on the computed crack growth life of the inherent flaw or crack, suitable inspection intervals are established so that cracks can be found and repaired long before they achieve a critical length.  The effectiveness of the damage tolerance approach depends on several factors that include fatigue crack growth data, initial crack sizes, fracture mechanics and computational methods, effects of shot-peening and cold working, and inspection techniques. The success of implementing the damage tolerance approach to fixed-wing aircraft structures, coupled with the FAA's goal to enhance aircraft safety has lead to RCDT research and development (R&D) efforts for rotorcraft.  In 2005, the FAA assessed the current state of RCDT and fracture mechanics technologies.  During the assessment, the FAA asked the rotorcraft community for their inputs on fracture mechanics and RCDT-related technologies.  The FAA then conducted the gap analysis to identify research needs for supporting FAA rulemaking.  Identified RCDT research tasks were then prioritized using the FAA prioritization process and criteria.  Finally, a roadmap for RCDT was developed to guide the research to support FAA rulemaking and the implementation of RCDT requirement.    2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct the RCDT research to support FAA rulemaking.  Particularly, this effort shall support FAR 29.571, 27.571, AC 29-2A, AC 27-1A, AC-29-2C, FAA Order 8110.9 which can be downloaded using the following link: http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements), 5 (Three-Page Technical Summary Requirements), and 6 (Formal Proposal Requirements).  Technical proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2008 (FY-08) funding for this effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as possible before FY-08 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 (Formal Proposal Requirements) shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) business days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email.   4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit a three-page technical summary in original and three additional hardcopies of the technical summary prior to submitting a formal proposal.  A cover page can be used, but the total number of pages cannot exceed three.  The three-page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the three-page technical summary and three hardcopies to: Air Traffic Organization Federal Aviation Administration William J. Hughes Technical Center Airport and Aircraft Safety R&D Division Airworthiness Assurance R&D Branch Code AJP-6360, Building 210 (Attn: Felix Abali) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the technical summary proposal will need to be emailed to Dy Le, dy.le@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security or password protection. Sixty (60) business days or earlier, after receipt of the three-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission of a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit to the FAA address (Felix Abali) noted above (1) a formal technical proposal with the signature of an authorizing official in original, (2) three additional hardcopies of the formal technical proposal, and (3) a CD containing the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word.  Proposals shall have the signature of an authorizing official.  Formal technical proposals shall contain a detailed discussion of the items presented in the selected three-page technical summary.  Additionally, formal technical proposals shall address all or some of the research requirements described in section 6 (Formal Proposal Requirements) of this announcement.  Formal technical proposals, three additional hardcopies, and a CD containing the proposal in Microsoft Word will be mailed to the FAA (Felix Abali) at the same address as used for the three-page technical summary.  In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format will be emailed to Dy Le, dy.le@faa.gov.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security or password protection. The FAA shall receive both versions of the formal technical proposals according to the submission deadlines required in section 3 (Submission Deadlines). Formal proposals shall not exceed 50 pages.   Formal technical proposals will be evaluated with an approximate FAA response time of ninety (60) business days or less.  5. Three-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the three-page technical summary.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	Affiliation, contact or principal investigator name, phone number, and mailing and email addresses. b.	The specific purpose/objective of the proposed research applicable to FAA rulemaking on RCDT. c.

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: ?	Program name ?	Government or contractor POC ?	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. ?	Date & period of performance ?	Cost of effort ?	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we?re looking for ways to implement a ?throttle?  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).

3.	Contractor must be capable of loading/offloading 463L pallets.
4.	Contractor shall supply its own MHE and manpower to operate the MHE.

5.	Identification of any limitations that would impact your company's ability to perform this service.

7.	Your company's recommended commercial pricing structure for the operation described above.
8.	Recommended incentive provisions to motivate performance that will meet or exceed the goals of this effort.
9.	Description of company's teaming relationships with subcontractors along with your company's understanding of the aircraft, aircrew, and ground support personnel safety, security, and operational risk management challenges of operating successfully in the region.

10.  THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON 13 NOV 07.
Question:  
On point number 3, "Provide a tiered cost per pound estimate to perform 48 hr and 72 hr time definite military assisted port-to-port service from/to these locations", does USTRANSCOM only want rates from/to these locations and not to the locations in point number 2 that include Kuwait and
Iraq where the main operations would most likely be placed?

Answer:  
Paragraph 2 locations and Paragraph 3 locations are essentially mutually exclusive; however, the Government does expect there to be mission opportunities originating from Paragraph 3 locations to Paragraph 2 locations.  In this case, those missions would 72-hour delivery service and pricing scheme.

<CONTACT>GREG LENGSFELD PURCHASING AGENT 3032369337     glengsfeld@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL), has a requirement for 10,000 Isolute C18 extraction columns.  The minimum requirements are: 500mg, 3ml, 2/stainless steel frits, packaged 50 columns per box.  The extraction columns shall be from a single batch.  Isolute C-18 columns have been tested by the NWQL Methods Research & Development Program and in use at the NWQL for the determination of pesticides in more than 50,000 water samples since the inception of the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program in 1992.  Comparability of data over the history of the NAWQA program is crucial, and the use of alternate extraction columns could result in changes in the recovery of pesticides that may incur undesirable shifts in the data that are provided to the national NAWQA database.  Such data changes could alter the interpretation of pesticide data by NAWQA project chiefs and other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, that use the NAWQA data. The U.S. Geological Survey considers this specified requirement as a sole source to Biotage Inc., 1725 Discovery Drive, Charlottesville, VA 22911.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services at the same cost may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer USGS, PO Box 25046 Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 8025-0046 no later than the closing date of this requirement (11/23/2007) 4:00 PM MST.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-21, effective 07 November 2007.  No numbered notes apply.  Any questions please contact Gregory Lengsfeld, Contract Specialist, at (303) 236-9337 or email glengsfeld@usgs.gov.

<DESC>BWXT Pantex is seeking companies experienced in the under ground- installation of high-density polyethylene pipe (HDPE) for fire suppression systems.  Further to the goal of BWXT Pantex to utilize small businesses, BWXT Pantex will allow small businesses to team with other companies (small business to large business) to perform this project.  BWXT Pantex is interested in a company that has a core competency required for the opportunity at hand, a proven track record for performance, a good safety record, and the necessary financial stability to bond this project and perform the work.  Other teaming relations one might consider are:  mentor protege and small business to small business.  

BACKGROUND:
BWXT Pantex LLC is the Prime Contractor of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Pantex Plant located near Amarillo, TX.  

PURPOSE:
This contract will provide construction services for the replacement of the High Pressure Fire Loop (HPFL) underground piping and valves at the Pantex Plant.  The HPFL supports the critical safety function of nuclear and non-nuclear facility fire suppression systems by supplying water to meet the system design requirements.  The HPFL is designed to meet the highest demand for quantity, pressure, and flow of a single facility sprinkler system.  

SYSTEM DESCRIPTON:
The HPFL is a water distribution system comprised of two earth-covered, grade-level reservoirs of 360,000-gallon nominal capacity; two pump facilities; and a distribution system of pipe arranged in a loop and grid plan.  Only one tank and one diesel-driven fire pump located at the same pumping facility are required for the HPFL to be operable.  The HPFL is installed and maintained solely to provide non-potable water to site fire suppression systems. The distribution pipe is arranged to afford at least two flow paths to each facility on the grid with ample valves to isolate sections while maintaining water supply to the remainder of facilities.  The current HPFL distribution pipe consists predominantly of ductile and cast iron pipe. Pipe sizes range from 6 inches to 14 inches in diameter. Fire hydrants are distributed throughout the areas served and are supplied water by the HPFL system.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to enhance the reliability of the HPFL. The facilities rely on the HPFL to provide fire protection water in accordance with the Pantex Plant Design Criteria Manual (PDCM), the Fire Protection Design Criteria Manual (FPDCM), the site-wide Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and the site Technical Safety Requirements (TSR). 

The Contractor shall furnish equipment, material procurements, construction services, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing mark-ups and NQA-1 project documents) for the HPFL project.

SCHEDULE
Construction shall be completed no later than 730 calendar days from Notice of Award.

<DESC>Please see the attached Request For Information (RFI).  This RFI is intended to solicit feedback from industry regarding both the objectives of the program and the potential contract structure best suited to meeting those objectives. The Marine Corp Logistics Command (MCLC) may seek a logistics support integrator to develop and manage a commercial capability to remanufacture and/or repair selected ground support equipment components such as engines, transmissions, and other drive train components, and optics and electronic components that require an extensive industrial footprint on the battlefield (there are currently 575 different items).  The intent would be for the Marine Corps to divest itself of field level industrial rebuild capabilities to the maximum extent practical and to develop a more responsive and cost effective supply chain with increased component availability and reliability.  The Marine Corps envisions a long-term strategic alliance with a commercial organization that has a proven track record for providing these services. The ultimate goal of this program is to provide responsive service to the Warfighter with a product that is both available and reliable.  A valuable by-product is a !  reduction in the variability of customer-wait-time to enable more effective inventory planning. THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI AND GOVERNMENT USE OF SUCH INFORMATION.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the Coordinating Center (TNCC) for ??Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet?? (TrialNet) that will be responsible for communication and coordination among the Clinical Centers and for management of the collection and analysis of genetic, immunologic, pathogenetic, clinical and biological data from the clinical sites. The TNCC will also be responsible for:  (1) support of study protocols and Manuals of Operation for each TrialNet trial, (2) maintaining the TrialNet website, and (3) organizing TrialNet Steering Committee meetings, DSMB (DSMB) meetings, EAB meetings and workshops.  In addition, the TNCC will be responsible for transferring all data and biosamples that are the property of NIDDK to the appropriate NIDDK repositories.

This acquisition will be solicited with minimum and maximum requirement. Award of this acquisition will be contingent on the availability of funds. All offerors will be required to submit a minimum and maximum proposal for fulfilling the requirements.

TrialNet, an international consortium of clinical research groups with expertise in type 1 diabetes (T1D) research, was created to carry out randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trials aimed at evaluating therapies for T1D prevention and early intervention.  Principal researchers in the consortium include both a clinical diabetologist and a leading immunologist from each major Clinical Center.  The TrialNet study group consists of a Biostatistics (Data and Operations) Coordinating Center, a Chairman??s Office, 6 Core Laboratories, a Compounding Pharmacy, 14 North American Clinical Centers, 15 North American Major Affiliate Centers, 84 North American Affiliate Centers, 4 International Clinical Centers, and 16 International Affiliate Centers.  In addition, TrialNet mechanistic studies are being performed in collaboration with the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  The primary goal of TrialNet is to conduct studies designed to evaluate new approaches to prevent or ameliorate T1D specifically by interdicting the T1D disease process. These include interventions designed to decrease ?]-cell destruction and/or enhance ?]-cell survival.  TrialNet researchers hope that preservation of remaining ?]-cells will delay or prevent the onset of disease in at-risk individuals and will make disease control easier in individuals with new onset T1D.  Optimal diabetes control is important because studies have clearly demonstrated that tight control results in fewer long-term complications (such as blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease).  Other TrialNet goals include (1) further characterization of diabetes risk through genetic, autoantibody, and metabolic studies in subjects identified through the Natural History, and (2) intervention studies to further develop new therapeutics through a better understanding of the immunologic bases of diabetes by analysis of serum, RNA, DNA, and cell function in at-risk and new-onset subjects as well as controls.

TrialNet has completed one clinical research study (MMTT versus GST), is in the midst of six active studies (Natural History, MMF/DZB, Anti-CD20, T Cell, NIP, and Oral Insulin) and will launch four more by the end of 2007 (Anti-CD3+Exenatide, Metabolic Control, Thymoglobulin [with ITN as lead], and IL2+Rapamycin [with ITN as lead]).  Other trials have been approved but a decision to launch has not been made due to uncertainty about available funds. TrialNet also works closely with the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium, regularly supplying them with blood samples for their studies aimed at a better understanding of the genetic basis of T1D.

The completed study (MMTT versus GST), comparing the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) to the Glucagon Stimulation Test (GST), was aimed at supporting the establishment of C-peptide as a reliable surrogate outcome measure for diabetes trials.  The study was designed to determine the best method for assessing insulin production during T1D clinical trials.  138 subjects, each within 3 years of diagnosis of T1D, underwent 2 MMTTs and 2 GSTs in random order within a 6 week period.  Results showed that peak C-peptide levels were significantly higher during the MMTT, indicating that detection of a C-peptide response would be more likely with the MMTT compared to the GST.  Correlation data revealed that both tests were highly reproducible, but the MMTT was significantly more reproducible than the GST.

One of the ongoing TrialNet studies is the Natural History Study.  Relatives of type 1 diabetics are recruited into the Natural History study based on HLA genotype and on the presence of certain diabetes-associated autoantibodies in the blood.  Subjects with one or more different type of diabetes autoantibody enter a program of risk assessment including glucose tolerance testing.  Once subjects are identified as being at risk for the development of diabetes, they are evaluated every 6 months to assess their autoantibody and metabolic status.  Close monitoring provides the benefit of rapid disease identification and avoidance of severe diabetes-onset related symptoms (such as ketoacidosis), and in addition, TrialNet has recently launched a pilot prevention trial for a group of at-risk subjects identified through the Natural History study.  Current plans call for screening of 20,000 individuals per year through 2011. In the event that funding is not available, the Natural History study will be terminated early and the pilot will not progress to the full trial.

Two of the TrialNet clinical research studies currently in progress involve immunumodulatory therapy in individuals with new-onset T1D.  The first of these studies, involving treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil and Daclizumab (MMF/DZB), completed enrollment of the 120 planned subjects in November 2006.  This study includes follow-up of subjects through 2010. The second active new-onset study employing immunomodulatory therapy involves Anti-CD20 (Rituximab). To date, this study has enrolled 16 of the total 66 patients planned, and plans to follow subjects through 2009-2010.

Another TrialNet protocol underway is the T Cell Validation Study.  This mechanistic study was designed to validate four different T cell assays for reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity in detecting autoimmune responses in diabetics versus controls.  T cell measurements are expected to provide important information relating to interventions in TrialNet??s clinical trials. This study is expected to complete recruitment in the North American sites by the end of February 2007, and 3 months later in the United Kingdom.  It will involve approximately 200 subjects at all sites combined.  Another round of assay testing is expected to launch prior to the end of the first quarter 2007, and to be completed by mid 2008.

TrialNet has recently launched the Nutritional Intervention to Prevent Type 1 Diabetes Pilot Trial (NIP).  In this trial, 90 newborn infants possessing a first degree relative with T1D and no diabetes-protective HLA alleles will be randomized to receive supplemental omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA) through either maternal (breast milk) or formula supplementation.  The trial is a pilot aiming to accrue all 90 subjects within one year and then follow them over 2 years. DHA will be measured in blood to determine whether the target value of 20% higher DHA is achieved in the treated compared to control group.  In addition, a 20% lower level of an inflammatory cytokine, IL1-beta, in the treated population is a primary objective of the pilot trial.  The pilot trial is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.  

The Oral Insulin Trial pilot was launched in January 2007.  This trial will test a hypothesis suggested by post hoc analysis of the earlier NIDDK-sponsored Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1).  That trial suggested that individuals with high levels of insulin autoantibodies in their blood, as well as other characteristics resulting in a 25-50% chance of getting T1D over the subsequent 5 years, could delay or prevent the onset of diabetes by taking insulin by mouth.  TrialNet will confirm or refute the hypothesis by recruiting subjects with similar characteristics into a trial involving daily insulin or placebo ingestion over approximately 5-8 years.  The trial is expected to recruit approximately 300 subjects through 2011 and follow them through 2018. In the event that funding is not available, the trial will halt recruiting and subjects will be followed as funding permits, if scientifically warranted.
Two additional TrialNet-led intervention trials are approved and under development, Anti-CD3+Exenatide and Metabolic Control. The Anti-CD3+Exenatide trial will be a randomized controlled open label trial.  Recently-diagnosed type 1 diabetics will be treated with a GLP-1 agonist, Exenatide, which is expected to promote insulin responsiveness and to help maintain residual ??-cell activity, and Anti-CD3 which has been previously determined to delay the decline in C-peptide production in newly-diagnosed T1D patients.  After safety review of the combination of drugs in 30 patients, the plan is to extend the treatment to 130 additional subjects. In addition, a 4-arm trial is being planned for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, not yet clinically diabetic, but with an 80% risk of developing frank diabetes over the subsequent 5 years.  For new onset trials the primary endpoints are C-peptide production at 1 or 2 years, while the prevention trial will use diabetes onset as the primary endpoint.  The new-onset trial is expected to be completed in 2010, while the prevention trial is expected to be finished in 2012.  In the event that funding is not available, the prevention trial will not be initiated. 

The newly approved Metabolic Control trial aims to provide very intensive metabolic control to subjects within a few days of T1D onset.  The plan is to use a system of continuous glucose monitoring and closed-loop insulin delivery in the hospital, followed by intense monitoring and insulin pump at home.  The patients will be randomized to either very intense or standard-of-care treatment and followed for C peptide production at 1 and 2 years post diagnosis, and should be completed in 2010.   

The contract is for a ten-year period, unless funding is not available, in which case the contract will be for a 4 to 5 year period.  As can be readily appreciated by the above descriptions, the TrialNet consortium has embarked upon a series of complex and challenging studies and trials, aimed at taking full advantage of the current opportunities for diabetes intervention, and to offer reasonable therapeutic options to recently diagnosed and at risk populations.  In each case, statistical methods and trial design have emphasized maximizing efficiency and minimizing trial duration by, for example, using maximum information design whenever possible.  In addition, by investing in infrastructure for recruiting, TrialNet expects to maximize efficiency and to capture all patient populations for which trial opportunities exist.  Finally, by investing in studies to optimize diabetes risk assessment, and to optimize clinical tests and validate mechanistic assays, TrialNet hopes to produce accurate and reliable information to allow optimization of the information to be extracted from each clinical trial and subject.  These activities are expected to provide the basis for treatments that can significantly delay or stop the decline of ??-cell function in subjects at risk for or recently diagnosed with T1D.

Current plans are to continue to launch a limited number of approved new trials though 2008.  Additional approved new trials will be launched only if sufficient funds are available.  Thereafter, if funding resources do not continue, TrialNet and the TNCC will adjust operations for completion of active trials launched by 2008, but will cease the initiation of new trials or the transition from pilot trials to full trials.  If funding continues, TrialNet will continue to solicit, review, develop, and execute new trials, and the TNCC operation will be maintained to accommodate those needs. It is expected that new trials will replace old ones and the TrialNet consortium will operate as projected herein.

Below is an overview of the subcontracts to the TNCC:  

TrialNet Coordinating Center Subcontracts

Clinical Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Clinical Centers located in North America, Europe, and Australia.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Clinical Centers enroll patients into multiple TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Clinical Center Subcontractors ?V Several of the Clinical Centers have subcontractors working with them on TrialNet projects.  They are subcontractors because they are located at sites that are distinct from (but generally close to) the parent Clinical Center.  The subcontractors that enroll patients into TrialNet clinical research studies will need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Major Affiliate Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Major Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Major Affiliates enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Affiliate Centers ?V There are currently 178 TrialNet Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive per-patient capitated reimbursements.  Almost all of the Affiliate Centers enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Core Laboratories ?V There are 5 TrialNet Core Laboratories located in North America.  These Core Laboratories receive infrastructure support to perform as central laboratories for all of the TrialNet studies.  It is crucial that the TrialNet Core Laboratories remain unchanged so that the intra- and inter-study laboratory data remains optimally comparable and reliable.  The Core Laboratories will need to continue to analyze TrialNet samples generated by TrialNet clinical research studies until the TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Laboratories ?V There are 7 TrialNet Laboratories located in North America and Europe.  These laboratories perform studies specific to one or more TrialNet studies.  These laboratories will need to remain constant until the studies they are involved with are completed to ensure optimization of intra- and inter-study data.  

Medical Monitor ?V The TrialNet Medical Monitor oversees the adverse event process related to all TrialNet studies.  This includes planning for tracking and evaluating adverse events, processing adverse event reports, and reporting adverse events to the appropriate parties, including the DSMB, IRBs, and appropriate regulatory agencies.  

Central Pharmacy and Supplies ?V The TrialNet Central Pharmacy handles all aspects of receipt, processing, and distribution of TrialNet study drug supplies.  For some studies, this includes production of drug and placebo.  This group also handles distribution of various medical supplies to the TrialNet sites.

Consultants ?V TrialNet utilizes consultants to assist with various TrialNet functions.  These consultants advise TrialNet on psychosocial and infectious disease issues related to the conduct of TrialNet trials.
A detailed listing of the 230+ clinical centers, affiliate centers, laboratories, central pharmacy, medical monitor, and consultants will be provided upon the release of the Request for Proposal.

This Source Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposals and at this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

Introduction:  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) invites white papers for research and development to support technology applications under this Sources Sought Announcement (SSA) CSC080001113. The administering DTRA program is the Combat Support Contingencies Directorate (CSC). The technologies and/or technology applications are to be considered for research and development efforts for the Fiscal Year 2008 starting in Dec 2008.  The total number of pages shall not exceed 5 pages to include rough order of magnitude on cost and effort.

Background:  DTRA's mission is to safeguard America and its allies from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives (CBRNE) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat. The objective of this SSA is to acquire scientific, technical, and operational information on the topic area of digital x-ray imaging systems supporting DTRA/CSEC.

Services:  This announcement seeks qualified sources from Government or Industry to submit white papers to integrate a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen or an Active Matrix/Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) screen with an Amorphous Silicon (a-Si ) Digital Flat X-ray panel. The intent is to provide a real time, direct reading view of an x-ray image on the x-ray panel without using a separate viewing screen, laptop, or any other detached viewing media. The combined instrument should be capable of being operated as a stand alone independent image capture system for use with 150 - 300 keV portable x-ray generator systems.   

The panel should have an active viewing area no less than 101mm x 101mm (4 x 4 inches) and no greater than 152 mm x 152 mm (6 x 6 inches). The viewing edge should be no more than 5mm (.197 inches) from the bottom of the panel and no more than 7 mm (.27 inches) from one side. The imaging system should have a minimum of 640 x 480 resolution with 10,000:1 contrast ratio.  The x-ray panel should be capable of high resolution images with a dynamic range between 12-14 bits with resolution up to 4lp/mm. 

The x-ray panel combined with the viewing screen should be no greater than 15 mm thick. The system should be internally powered using a commercial off the shelf power supply such as 3 volt Li-ion battery with the option to use an external power supply using Mil BA5590 batteries. The system should be capable of 1 hour continuous operation with the internal power supply and minimum of 3 hours on the external power. The system should also use a removable storage media to save images. The entire system should be as small as possible while considering the viewing area limitations and weigh no more than 4.5 kgs. 
The instrument should be ruggedized, weather proof and capable of operating in all weather, terrain and environments. The controls should be simple on/off selectable switches, thumb wheel type switches, or touch screen controls that are easily operated with one hand. The total time of the effort must be completed in 18 months or less.      

Capabilities:  Potential sources must have experience and expertise that demonstrates an in-depth knowledge and background in x-ray imaging systems and flat panel video imaging systems.

Responses:  Where applicable and appropriate, white papers should directly compare and contrast capabilities with current commercial off the shelf items or known developmental efforts with respect to improvements, limitations, weight, size, cost, power density, capacity, duration, dynamic range of performance, ease of production and ease of use.  Specific performance data and materials compatibility information should be provided.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. Offers having the technical skills and capabilities to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought. Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  Responses should address how the Offeror can meet any part or all of the above requirements and should not exceed five (5) pages in total.
Please submit responses to Wanda Maddox, Contract Specialist via email at wanda.maddox@dtra.mil no later than 12:00 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) on November 30, 2007.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SBA proposes to increase size standards for Heating Oil Dealers and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Bottled Gas) Dealers industries.
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to change the small business size standard for the Heating Oil Dealers industry (North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 454311)) from $11.5 million in average annual receipts to 50 employees, and the size standard for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Bottled Gas) Dealers industry (NAICS code 454312) from $6.5 million in average annual receipts to 50 employees.     Large and fluctuating increases in the prices of heating oil and propane over the past several years indicate that a more stable measure of firm size based on number of employees rather than receipts is needed for these two industries.<p>

SBA must receive comments to the proposed rule on or before November 30, 2007.<p>

To submit comments, please go to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/">regulations.gov</a> and use "SBA-2007-0008-0001" (no quotes) as your document ID search term and/or "SBA-2007-0008" (no quotes) as your docket ID search term to locate the proposed rule.

<SUBJECT>D -- Webcast Services
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Omnitec Solutions, Inc., for the acquisition of NACA Webcast Services demonstrating PowerPoint Presentations.  At this time, the Government intends to make an award for a one-year period.  

Nature & Description of Action:   To acquire webcast services from an umbrella contract with the Departmental Offices (DO).  Omnitec Solutions, Inc. has been awarded a five year contract (Reference Contract No. DOX-06-001) from DO for media and webcast services.  Currently, DO does not have procedures in place to administer or place orders for other bureaus.  Therefore, authority is given for other bureaus to place orders under this umbrella contract.  A room has been designated as an official location at the Main Treasury for all webcast services.  Omnitec Solutions, Inc. has setup the room with standardized webcast equipment for DO and other bureau use.  No other vendor is allowed to set up media services in this location.  Omnitec Solutions, Inc. is the sole vendor allowed to use this room for media services.  

Based on this information, a sole source to Omnitec Solutions, Inc. is intended for this contract.  No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses no later than 9:00 a.m. ET on November 16, 2007.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Omnitec Solutions, Inc. (DBA Omnitec).  Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to psb2@bpd.treas.gov.  E-mail responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.  We are unable to receive the following computer file extensions:  .bat, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .dat, .exe, .gz, .hta, .pif, .rar, .scr, .tgz, .vbs, .z, and .zip.

<SUBJECT>A -- Tiny, Independent, Coordinating Spacecraft (TICS) Program Industry Day Conference
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE:  DARPA/TTO will host an Industry Day Conference in support of the Tiny, Independent, Coordinating Spacecraft (TICS) program (BAA 08-14) on December 6, 2007 at One Virginia Square Building, SPC Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd, 3rd Floor, Arlington, Virginia, 22201 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Registration begins at 8:00 a.m. and the conference will start promptly at 9:00 a.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the TICS program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the TICS program is to develop an innovative approach to satellite systems by constructing robust "minimal mass satellites" of 1-4 kg capable of aggregating with other TICS elements to form complex shapes or "aggregates" to perform servicing and sensing missions.  By building numerous, similar TICS, rather than hand-crafting one-of-a-kind systems, the program intends to make obsolescent most integration and test activities.  Synergistic communications and resource sharing among a number of physically connected, identical small satellites will mimic the functions of larger spacecraft, and will permit reconfiguration to perform new missions as the need arises.  The TICS aggregate will display coordinated behavior and share power, data, and propellant.  The TICS program will be more responsive and flexible than conventional satellites that are complex and expensive to build, test, and verify for launch.  

The Government envisions a three phase development program potentially culminating in a space demonstration.  Phase 1 will consist of the unit design and component developmental testing.  A hardware-in-the-loop testbed will be established to simulate the vehicle hardware and software with increasing fidelity as the program progresses.  Phase 2 will include the completion of a detailed prototype design for ground test demonstration, along with simulated rendezvous, docking, and aggregate behavior dynamics.  If Phase 2 is successful, a Phase 3 effort could include an on-orbit demonstration of aggregate operations.  One or more awards for execution of Phase 1 by competing Contractor teams are expected.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than November 29, 2007 at the following website:  https://enstg.com/signup/passthru.cfm?ConferenceCode=TIC81654.   The conference code is TIC81654.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than TWO representatives per organization.  Organizations are strongly encouraged to limit these representatives to no more than one business development person and should include at least one chief engineer or technical lead who can participate in technical discussions. The December 6th Industry Day conference will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Registration is restricted to US citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens only.  Proof of Citizenship or Permanent Resident Status (forms found on the registration website) must be provided no later than November 29, 2007.  Please fax the US Proof of Citizenship or the DARPA Form 60, Foreign National Visit Request, to:  Hugo Castellon, Booz Allen Hamilton, fax 703-816-5444. 

Additionally, attendees will be able to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in an industry-only forum.  No Government personnel will be present during this time.  Upon arrival, the attendees will receive their scheduled time for presenting.  The opportunity to present will be afforded on a first come, first served basis.  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all proposed sensitive or unclassified material is reviewed prior to being displayed at the conference by the organization that funded the research.  Presentations may contain up to ten (10) slides and are limited to ten (10) minutes duration.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.  Proposers desiring to present at the TICS Industry Day Conference should send an electronic copy of all material to be presented to BAA08-14@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than November 29, 2007.

In the event that there is a discrepancy between information posted here and on www.fbo.gov, the FedBizOpps site takes precedence.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Offers are due no later than November 19, 2007.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Nov 2006),
Subparagraph (b) clauses: (1), (7), (8), (14-21), (24), (26) and (31). The Defense Priorities and Allocations System assigned Rating is DO-A1; 
The closing date/time for receipt of offers is 12 OCTOBER 2007, 3:00 pm, Local ESDT.  Facsimile and e-mail quotes are acceptable and may be faxed to (252) 334-5240 or E-mailed to Ewa.K.Brown@uscg.mil. Contact Ewa Brown (252) 334-5407 for questions regarding this synopsis/solicitation.

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

INTRODUCTION

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

OBJECTIVE

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to be assigned to field offices for staff enhancement, to serve on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and to assess critical situations as warranted.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

All RATS will be responsible for performing all or some of the tasks below; however, all work will be done in coordination with OFDA personnel.  RATS are considered U.S. Government (USG) employees, and, as such, are required to further USG foreign policy objectives.

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies - natural, technological and conflict-related disasters - as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

The RATS - Generalist's responsibilities will include the following:

* Conduct initial assessments of the vulnerable population and recommend appropriate relief activities.  Facilitate and coordinate actual USG emergency response activities with the USAID Mission, with other donor agencies, and with the U.S. Embassy;
* Liaise with other responders, i.e., government agencies, international organizations or private voluntary organizations.  Determine the capacity of the affected community and ensure that adequate resources are available to the international response effort.  Brief host governments, the U.S. Military, U.S. Embassy and USAID Mission, as necessary;
* Coordinate and manage oversight of OFDA-funded activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.  Monitor financial statements from the grantee(s) and the timeliness and quality of response(s);
* Identify disaster mitigation measures where appropriate that could be linked to disaster response activities.  Review mitigation principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA/Washington staff;
* Develop various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams.  Provide briefings and written reports as required;
* Conduct personnel-related activities, property management, safety and security assessments, supply management, contracting services, leasing, travel, and records management, as needed and when tasked;
* Coordinate delivery of relief supplies provided by OFDA.  Ensure that distribution is carried out in accordance with USAID policies and regulations and with OFDA strategies;
* Interpret USAID policies and apply them to OFDA activities as appropriate;
* Determine availability of support resources including staff, equipment, storage, office space, and communications; identify the obligating authority for procurement of supplies, commodities and services;
* Participate in appropriate training either as a participant and/or trainer;
* Operate DART communications equipment and operate a four-wheel drive or standard-shift vehicle in cross-country conditions;
* Provide expert advice to OFDA DARTs, RMTs, regional missions, and/or OFDA's Washington-based staff on humanitarian issues for populations at risk in conflict, disaster affected, or otherwise food-insecure areas;
* Foster an effective team environment; guide and coordinate the work of other team members when serving as Response Manager, DART Leader, or other supervisory capacity;
* Adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines, coordinate all travel with the DART Leader, the DART Security Officer, the USAID Executive Officer (EXO) and/or the Washington-based RMT.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The incumbent will take direction from and report to the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) Leader or his/her designee, and that person designated as his/her supervisor in the Activation Memo. 

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in responding to administrative needs.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-08-Q-0395. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2000-07. NUWC Division Newport intends to purchase the following items: Two (2) 10 cell Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks (SOFCs).  Required delivery is 14 days after award, F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. It is expected to place a purchase order with Delphi Corporation, on a sole source basis. The Department of Energy (DOE) and The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) will provide for independent testing and evaluation of solid oxide fuel cell stacks being developed under the DOE?s Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) program. These power sources must operate in an air free environment. SOFCs operating on pure oxygen instead of air are unique to the SOFC research committee. Oxygen blown coal gasifiers could be designed to provide pure oxygen feed to the SOFC power plant block. Understanding SOFC performance under these extreme conditions will be useful for future coal gasification plants as well as NUWC?s Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs). It is expected that NUWCDIVNPT will test a variety of solid oxide fuel cells being developed under the SECA program. The first stack to be tested will be from Delphi, a SECA Industry Team partner.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   DESCRIPTION:  Using the BAA process, AATD is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct the 6.3 R&D effort in support of the  Rotor Durability Army Technology Objective (ATO) and the High Performance Rotary Wing Vehicle (RWV) Designs program.  The Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This BAA constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendm ents.  INTRODUCTION The objective of the Rotor Durability and Performance BAA is to support the Rotor Durability ATO and the High Performance RWV Designs program by demonstrating technologies in the areas of rotor durability, high performance rotary  wing vehicle designs, and power and data transfer interfaces to support current and future Army Aviation platforms.  This Rotor Durability ATO is a four year effort with multiple milestones. This ATO will demonstrate improved main/tail rotor environmental durab ility, repairability, and performace resulting in significantly increased aircraft availability, increased OPTEMPO and reduced life-cycle costs through an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for the Current Force.  In addition, this BAA will also solicit  enabling technologies to support the 6.3 High Performance RWV Designs program.  SOLICITATION TOPICS  There are three topics under this announcement.  TOPIC 01-2008  Rotor Durability recent combat experience has emphasized the need for durable helicopter r otor blades for Current Force helicopters that provide permanent erosion protection, reliable and maintainable icing protection, improved repairability, and improved rotor performance. AATD seeks to develop and demonstrate an integrated durable rotor blade  resulting in significantly increased aircraft availability, increased OPTEMPO, and reduced life-cycle costs through an improvement-by-spares upgrade concept for the Current Force.  When compared to an Offeror-selected baseline Army helicopter, the  improv ements to existing main and tail rotor systems will:  Increase blade life in erosive environments (both sand and rain) to at least 1000 flight hours; Provide de-ice/anti-ice solution that meets or exceeds the life requirement of the baseline blade;  Increa se allowable battle damage assessment and repair (BDAR) limits by at least 100% for the baseline rotor blades, thus doubling the effective allowable damage and keeping previously unserviceable blades in operation longer; and Improve rotor performance (at l east 7% improvement in hover out of ground effect performance) with minimal required changes to other existing systems. Rotor blade erosion occurs as rotorcraft fly through various debris fields, usually sand and/or rain. Continual bombardment quickly erod es the protective material and damages the structure of the rotor blade. If too much damage is imparted to the blade, it must be scrapped and replaced with a new blade. There have been many efforts to mitigate this phenomenon with various incarnations of t apes, boots, and sprays. A long term material solution is required to increase aircraft availability and to offset the high costs of supporting these intermediate solutions. Icing conditions limit the environment in which rotorcraft can operate. The  curre nt electrothermal de-icing systems on Army aircraft are unreliable and hard to maintain with blades heated by wires embedded in the leading edge. Wires burn out, and if controllers fail, leading edges can overheat, causing damage to composites and blade de lamination.  A reliable, maintainable de-ice/anti-ice solution is desired. Numerous blade s are retired in theater after receiving only minor damage, because the current published allowable damage criteria (aircraft maintenance manuals) for main rotor  blades are stringent.  Improved Durability and Damage Tolerance methodology and lightweight b allistic tolerance technology development is required to establish  expanded rotor damage and repair criteria that can be implemented in the field for continued flight.  Rotor blade technologies that, when implemented on a field vehicle, improve system lev el performance but require minimal changes to other existing system s and do not adversely affect rotor durability are of interest. Potential technologies include, but are not limited to, tailored rotor blades to exploit couplings available with composite materials, advanced blade planforms and/or tip shapes, and advanced airfoils. A cost/benefit tradeoff for the integration and implementation of durability and performance technologies to the current fleet, including the establishment of key metrics, shall be conducted.  The approach must yield a single integrated blade durability upgrade solution, not merely a collection of component technologies. Component level testing, using facilities such as erosion test rigs, icing tunnels, and ballistic test ranges, shall be utilized as a method of screening and validating candidate solutions.  Upon completion of component level testing, the top performers will be evaluated for candidate technology interoperability. For example, erosion and icing protection solutions are often used independently, however the icing system must be able to work with the installed erosion system (i.e. the erosion system must not cause damage to or inhibit the functionality of the icing system, and vice versa).  BDAR solutions in the form o f increased allowables or repair solutions that lead to increased op erational flight hours will be tested and validated at the component level, such that BDAR methodology can be implemented in advance of the other integrated durability solutions and can h ave an immediate impact on the soldier in the field.  The most promising durability improvements yielding the highest return on investment for the Army and the greatest probability of successful transition through spare replacement will be selected for rot or integration and demonstration.  A suitable test plan (to include facilities required) to conduct full-scale testing of the integrated system in order to demonstrate and evaluate durability, performance, compatibility/interoperability with other integrat ed durability upgrades, and sustainment of overall aircraft performance will be developed.  Testing will be conducted and the results will be documented.  TOPIC 02-2008  High Performance, Low Vibration, and Low Noise Enabling Technologies Current rotary wi ng vehicle configurations do not meet the Army's Future Force requirements to be adaptable, tailorable, enduring, precise, fast, resilient, and agile.  AATD seeks to develop and demonstrate high performance enabling technologies that when compared to an Of feror-selected baseline Army helicopter will:  Reduce vibrations in the fuselage by at least 20%; Reduce acoustic  signature by at least 6 db; and Increase maximum blade loading by at least 16%. The enabling technologies shall be compatible with the operat ional environment (sand and rain erosion, icing, wide operating temp erature range, and BDAR) with minimal impact to the baseline vulnerability, susceptibility, reliability, and maintainability. If on-blade controls and/or sensors are required, the unique challenges in reliably transferring the required data and power across the rotating frame (rotating component to static airframe) shall also be addressed.  A suitable test plan (to include facilities required) to conduct large scale testing of the integrat ed system in order to demonstrate and evaluate performance improvement, vibration and noise reduction will be developed.  Testing will be conducted and the resu lts will be documented.  Topic 02-2008 is the initial effort of the 6.3 High Performance RWV Designs program. The objective of the 6.3 High Performance RWV Designs program is to develop enabling technologies and to develop and evaluate alternative RWV Desi gns that support requirements of the Army's Future Force to be more adaptable, tailorable, enduring, precise, fast, resilient, and agile. The High Performance RWV Designs program will commence by developing and demonstrating high performance enabling techn ologies (the effort described in this Topic 02-2008).  Subsequent efforts will apply the enabling technologies to develop and demonstrate full scale component technologies, and finally demonstrate significant performance improvements at the advanced config uration level. TOPIC 03-2008 Rotating / Non Rotating Interface for Power and Data Transfer Current research in advanced rotor and control systems is developing effective active on-blade control implementation.  In order to make such a system viable and pra ctical, there must be an affordable and reliable method to transfer data and power across the rotating/nonrotating interface of the rotor and fuselage.  De-icing/anti-icing systems and health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) also require more reliable a nd durable transfer technology.  AATD seeks to develop and demonst rate a system for bidirectional transfer of data and power across the rotating/nonrotating interface which supports on-blade controls, de-icing and health monitoring of future high performa nce rotor designs.  For design and demonstration purposes, the Offe ror must select a current Army baseline rotor system. Transfer requirements for on-blade actuators requires at least 8 to 40 kilowatts of power with capability of transferring 1 Mbps for c ontrol commands and 32 to 64 Mbps of data for control feedback for u p to 100 channels of data.  Operating characteristics for the rotating/nonrotating interface must accommodate rotational speeds from 200 RPM (Main Rotor) to greater than 2000 RPM (Tail Ro tor).  Consideration must be given to environmental sealing, EMI shielding, wide range of operating temperatures, high shock and vibration environments and fail-safe design. The resulting design must be optimized to minimize any weight and volume impact an d be physically compatible with the baseline rotor system.  MTBF is targeted to be greater than 4500 hours.  Slip-ring devices are commonly used to transfer electrical signals through a rotating joint.  However, traditional slip rings are not adequate if t hey are placed in a flight-critical path, since they suffer from data  dropouts and noise contamination with high maintenance requiring frequent cleaning and brush replacements.  Innovative methods of data/power transfer, emphasizing reliability and fail-s afety have been recently investigated and tested for the Army (Reference: F. K. Straub, et al, Rotating/Nonrotating Interface for Data and Power, American Helicopter Society 62nd Annual Forum, Phoenix, AZ, May 9-11, 2006).  However, the resulting hardware is not adequate in performance, weight and volume for practical application to helicopter rotor systems.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All questions and requests for clarification will be directed by e-mail to Mr. Jesse Searles e-mail address jesse.searles1@us.army.mil. The specifications are as follows: The borescope needs to have an articulating tip that will allow it to move a minimum of 130 degrees in order to serve as the sole tool to be used on every type of airframe the Army operates.  This tip needs to be submersible in order to inspect pieces such  as fuel cells, since we operate at a remote location.  The ability to inspect the interior of fuel cells without de-fueling is paramount since we have no access to de-fueling assets and the possibility of corrosion is higher because we rely on the civilia n contractor to add PRIST to the fuel, which prevents corrosion in ballistic resistant fuel cells.   The borescope needs to have the ability to video record so maintainers can prove to engineers that they are conducting borescope procedures correctly should an unexpected grounding condition occur.  The video capability will prevent unnecessary down time w hile maintainers explain their NDI methods by providing video proof of their procedures.  The borescope also needs to have the ability to print pictures to send to engineering departments for analysis.   The borescope needs to be durable and weatherproof as some of the procedures will need to take place outside on transient aircraft.  The ability to utilize the borescope outside is crucial in our ability to continue missions.  All questions and clarifications will need to be delivered via e-mail to Mr. Jesse Searles at jesse.searles1@us.army.mil by 1400 MST 20 November 2007.  This combined synopsis/solicitation closes 1400 MST 23 November 2007.

<DESC>Listed below are the the Questions and Answers regarding the requirement for ballistic protection: 

Question #1 - Is the customer referring to the NIJ Level 3A ballistic solution? 

Answer: Yes - As per the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) pg 2 para 2.4 Type IIIA (High Velocity 9 mm; 44 Magnum) This armor protects against 9 mm Full Metal Jacketed Round Nose (FMJ RN) bullets, with nominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 427 m/s (1400 ft/s) or less, and 44 Magnum Semi Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP) bullets, with nominal masses of 15.6 g (240 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 427 m/s (1400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against most handgun threats, as well as the threats mentioned in sections 2.1, 2.2 

Question #2 - Required protection is listed as 3A. Is NIJ certification required? If so, to which NIJ standard? If not, what QTY of test results are desired? 

Answer: Yes. The standard is - 0101.04. Please see the complete NIJ standard on the ARSC website which is accessible at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/arsc/contracting/HH65/HH-65.htm. Question 


Question #3 - Is the customer expecting a flexible solution (Kevlar blanket), or a semi rigid lightweight solution made from HPPE fiber? 

Answer: A flexible blanket has been discussed as the goal, meeting the required level of protection while also keeping the weight down to a minimum of 1.5 lbs per sq/ft. We would entertain any solution meeting this requirement.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a  Coast  Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP Program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for the urgent and compelling  reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.
Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103 (d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period  specified. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) - Generalist (Multiple Positions) - Worldwide

The purpose of this amendment is to provide the attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a 

Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be 

granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

<DESC>PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume.  In presenting the proposal material,  prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequ ate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  Offerors may submit proposals to multiple topics. Each  proposal shall describe the proposed effort within only one of the three topics. TECHNICAL VOLUME:  The technical volume of the proposal shall provide detail that justifies the benefits of the proposed technology relative to the topic objectives, and a plan to develop and transition the technology to current or future Army aircraft. The technical volume shall also include a clear statement of the  technical objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience. It shall contain a Statement of Work (SOW), milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources  to be employed in the effort, and a program management section. Offerors shall identify and substantiate the beginning and ending Technology Readiness Levels. Volume I (Technical) shall be written and shall consist of a maximum of 60 pages exclusive of ti tle page, section  dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices for Topics 01-2008 and 02-2008 and a maximum of 25 pages exclusive of title page, section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/t ables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices for Topics 03-2008.  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages specified. Submission shall be limited to the number of pages specified, total inclusive of any drawings, charts, et c.  Type shall be no smaller than a font size of ten (10) and shall be at least single spaced.  Page size shall not exceed 8 1/2'x 11.  Fold-out illustrations required for reader ease are allowed, however, illustration shall be counted in 8 1/2'x 11'increm ents (e.g., a 11'x 17'document will count as two pages).  Except for the Technical Volume, the number of proposal pages is not limited.  COST VOLUME: Within the Cost Proposal, offerors shall indicate the proposed funding instrument (e.g., FAR-based contrac t and type (CPFF,cost reimbursable, etc.) or TIA).  The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown providing man-hours and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, travel and equipment and materials list ings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractor's submission.  Any cost share will be calculated as follows: contractor cash plus in-kind contribution divided by project value.  Any resulting agreement value will exclude recipient's sunk'costs of prior research as cost match. Only additional resources that will be provided by the recipient to carry out the current project will be counted.  SUBCONTRACTING PLAN:  Not applica ble if proposing a ward under a non-FAR instrument (i.e. TIA) or if the offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $550,000, and there are subcontracting possibil ities, offerors mus t submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the offeror's proposal submission.  DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontr acting incentive and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appro priate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219-7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contract related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunit ies exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to par ticipate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs.
