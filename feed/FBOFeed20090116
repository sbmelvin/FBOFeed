<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 6.302-1) with Mizuho Orthopedic Systems, Inc, 30031 Ahern Ave, Union City, CA 94587-1234 as the only responsible source that can provide a brand name only Modular Table System as required by USNS Comfort. 

 In compliance with the Command’s initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Fleet Hospital applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the OSI Modular Table System manufactured by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc.  

Modular Table System made by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc. has been standardized for all of the fleet hospitals.  The installed base is currently in more than half of the fleet hospitals as well as each new hospital that is being built.  These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the fleet hospitals.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet hospitals and reduce the lifesaving capability of each of the fleet hospitals.  

Based on the above information, it has been determined that the only technically acceptable Modular Table System is manufactured by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc.

Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all its components shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America; even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 


Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Christina Boyd-Brown at christina.boyd-brown@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Christina Boyd-Brown. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 27 January 2009.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT
In accordance with Section 3.2.1.2.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), the Academic Community and Aviation Industry are hereby informed that the FAA has future requirements in systems engineering with a focus on developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  It is anticipated that these requirements will be fulfilled under a cooperative agreement entitled: The NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Since this is a market survey seeking interested sources, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
The purpose of this announcement is to determine interest in the university community and its potential partners (private and/or other public institutions). Each institution and organization should have the established technical research capabilities and academic curriculum necessary to participate as a potential team member, affiliate, or industry partner with FAA under the proposed NextGen Systems Engineering & Environmental (NSEE) Program.  
This market survey also seeks to identify subcontracting opportunities and direct contract/agreement opportunities for universities (particularly Minority Serving Institutions, such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Native American Serving Institutions (NASIs) among others).
It is the intent of the FAA to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team(s).  In addition, under a cooperative agreement the FAA will also provide for IPA (Intergovernmental Personnel Arrangements) assignments and OTAs (Other Transaction Arrangements) as deemed necessary.  IPAs allow for continued knowledge, personnel exchange, and augmentation of internal resources through the exchange of personnel.  An OTA is an agreement between the FAA and a non-Federal entity (either foreign or domestic) where the FAA's purpose is to obtain a direct benefit that advances the agency's mission while also providing assistance to the general public.  
Results from this market survey will assist the FAA in determining the method and type of procurement competition - full and open; limited; or sole source.  
The cooperative agreement(s) is/are anticipated to last ten (10) years in duration. The agreement(s) will provide the terms and conditions for the potential contracts, grants, Intergovernmental Personnel Assignments (IPAs), other transaction arrangements (OTAs).  The total combined award(s) are not expected to exceed $140 million.

<DESC>The above Name (Mary Dobbs) is not the Market Survey Point of Contact.The Market Survey Point of Contact is Audrey Lucas at (202) 385-8364.
This market survey provides clarification and is in addition to the previously posted FAA En Route Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) Modernization Program - Architecture and Engineering Services posted on FAA Contract Opportunities on June 6, 2008 (Post ID 6759).  
This is a market survey for the FAA's En Route ARTCC Modernization Program - Architecture and Engineering Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing FAA En Route ARTCC Modernization Program Architecture and Engineering Services.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990. All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a size standard of $7,000,000. Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify, but not limited to the following:         	Type of services provided by your firm. 	Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance).
	Number of years in business.
	In-house Mechanical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Civil Engineers, Fire Protection Engineers and Environmental Engineers.
	Retention of a significantly large resource pool of varied engineering specialties to meet the fluctuating demands for engineering services at various times.  Resource levels needed to execute work could range from a low of 15 Full Time Equivalents to over 120 Full Time Equivalents, at any given time.
	Perform seismic studies.
	Provide A&E Services throughout the Continental US to   21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers and two (2) Combined En route RADAR Approach (CERAP) Facilities, which include Guam and San Juan.
	Meeting fluctuating needs at any given time to support ARTCC's on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis.
	Bonding ranging from $50,000 to $5,000,000 per task order.

2. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a)	certified businesses. 

Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. In addition, interested parties must prepare and submit the attached SF-330 Architect Engineer Qualifications.

<a href="mailto:susan.l.stefanovic@nasa.gov">Susan L. Stefanovic</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for contractor products and services to supportExtravehicular Vehicle Activity (EVA) Systems. These products and services includeExtravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Space Suit sustaining engineering and processing; EVAtools sustaining engineering and processing; continued implementation of ShuttleTransition and Retirement (StaR) effort to support ISS without Shuttle flights, ISShardware integration and mission planning, and EVA hardware research and development.This acquisition will support the EVA requirements for International Space StationProgram (ISS) through FY2020. Two options will be included to provide EVA support for anySSP flights in FY2011 and FY2012 should retirement of the Shuttle be postponed. The existing EMU Space Suit for Shuttle and ISS was developed for the Shuttle program andhas been in use since the early 1980s. It is not compatible with the requirements forthe Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) being acquired under a separate solicitation.NASA/JSC intends to acquire the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems products andservices from Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc. (HSSSI), on anoncompetitive basis. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) entitled Only one responsiblesource and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, HSSSI hasbeen determined to be the only company that possesses the unique capabilities necessaryto accomplish this acquisition. The EVA services and supplies to be included in thisprocurement have been deemed to be available only from the Extravehicular Mobility Unit(EMU) original source for the continued provision of highly specialized products andservices. Award to any other source will result in a substantial duplication of cost tothe Government that will not be recovered through competition. Design and development of EMU LSS test stands and test rigs took place utilizing HSSSIcorporate assets. Thirty-seven test stands and rigs necessary for the performance of thiswork are HSSSI capital equipment and are not available to provide to other vendors.Additionally, to meet the EMU OEM requirements, HSSSI developed highly specializedmanufacturing processes, process specifications, design and manufacturing notebooks, anddetailed instructions, which are used for: 1) EMU LSS component manufacturing, assembly,disassembly, 2) EMU LSS component inspection, wear and tear assessment, test andrefurbishment, and 3) EMU LSS integration into the EMU suit system. HSSSI is the onlycontractor that possesses the above documentation. The documentation is proprietary toHSSSI and therefore is not available to provide to other vendors. A full and open competition of all of the requirements for the EVA Systems contract,resulting in an award to a non-incumbent, would require the non-incumbent to gain all ofthe above unique capabilities of the incumbent. These processes, procedures, andcapabilities are critical and essential elements in the successful performance of thisscope of work. In summary, a full and open competition for all of the EVA Systems requirements wouldrequire the transition of critical responsibilities to another contractor which wouldresult in a significant increase in risk to mission assurance coupled with an extensivetime requirement (estimated to be 3-years) to establish the essential elements forsuccess explained above. This would ultimately result in a substantial duplication ofcost to the Government. The Government could not expect to regain these costs throughcompetition during the life expectancy of the EMU program. The contract type for this acquisition will be Cost plus Award Fee (CPAF). The contractwill be performance-based, with a small portion of the contract identified as IDIQ. The Place of Performance is Windsor Locks, Connecticut, and Houston, Texas.The Period of Performance for this effort is contemplated to be 10 years, consisting of afive year base period, five one year options, and two options to support any SSP flightsin FY2011 and FY2012. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.See Note 22. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336419 and 1,000 employees, respectively. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 4, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are acceptable, but shall not be considered formal. All formalresponses to this posting shall only be submitted and accepted via e-mail.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Carol A. Wood, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8904, Email carol.wood@nist.gov - Patrick K Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6335, Fax (301)975-8884, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf ot the Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Team Nanotech of Germany, to provide tips for a VeecoCritial Dimension Atomic Force Microscope (CD-AFM), Model Number SXM320, currently installed in the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML).  

The Precision Engineering Division is responsible for dissemination of the SI meter across all length scales.  Within this division, the Surface and Microform Metrology Group uses various technologies – including stylus profiling, optical microscopy, and  atomic force microscopy – to fulfill this mission in the micrometer and nanometer ranges.

Toward this end, the group maintains a Critical Dimension Atomic Force Microscope, a Veeco, model number SXM320, which is used primarily for linewidth measurements in the 100 nm range.  

The subject of this procurement is the CD-AFM tips.  The Veeco SXM320 is designed to operate with a specific type of CD-AFM tip, which was originally manufactured for Veeco by Team Nanotec as a sub-contractor.  At present, the only brand of CD-AFM tip which is compatible with the SXM320 is sold under the Team Nanotec brand name as the SXM-XXX series of tips.

The applications for which NIST now uses the SXM320, predominantly require the SXM-CDR120, SXM-CD100, and SXM-CD75 type of tips, with a secondary need for the SXM-CD130 and SXM-CDR70 series.

These tips must be supplied on an SXM320 compatible substrate, and meet the dimensional requirements for tip width and flare (overhang).  These widths are 130 nm, 120 nm, 100 nm, 75 nm, and 70 nm,  respectively for the CD130, CDR120, CD100, CD75, and CDR70 tips.  The total overhang (both sides) on all tips must be at least 10 nm.

These tips are commercial items.  Team Nanotech has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  Team Nanotech has no known distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide the required CD-AFM tips.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by February 2, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Robin D Hope-Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-4379, Fax 301-402-8169, Email rhwilli@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Academy Health, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Suite 600, Washington, D.C., 20036 for professional and technical support services related to the continued development and enhancement of HSRProj (Health Services Research Projects in Progress), a grants and contracts information system. The period of performance will be for one year from date of award with four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Background: In 1993, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) received a mandate (P.L. 103-43) to establish a National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR). The NICHSR has continued and expanded on the work started by the Office of Health Services Research Information, established at the NLM in 1990, in response to a previous legislative mandate (P.L.101-239) to develop and enhance NLM's information services in the field of health services research and technology assessment.</p>
<p>In response to these legislative mandates and an Institute of Medicine (IOM) study, completed in September 1991, NLM initiated a multifaceted health services research information program with specific provisions to: 1) enhance the information infrastructure for health services research by improving access to published results of health services research, developing and expanding automated access to a range of information important to producers and users of health services research, developing specialized databases covering such information as research in progress, developing additional search systems; and 2) enhance outreach to the health services research community by using established specialized professional groups to test both enhanced and new NLM products and to establish a specific mechanism to provide advice to NLM on health services research information programs.</p>
<p>The contractor will: Task I: Provide expert review and guidance identifying appropriate organizations and researchers involved in health services research projects of merit and solicit their participation in HSRProj database; Task 2: Provide expert review and coordination of the selection, collection, review and editing of research projects from publicly available resources, and of submissions from a wide variety of funders and producers of ongoing health services research projects for inclusion in HSRProj; Task 3: Develop and provide targeted educational programs for health services researchers about HSRProj and the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR); Task 4: Conduct a research project resulting in a publishable article; and Task 5: Identify unmet information needs of the health services research community that might be addressed by the NICHSR and its partners.</p>
<p>AcademyHealth is the designer and original developer of the HSRProj information system. Therefore, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, AcademyHealth is the only source known to NLM that is capable of fulfilling this requirement. Academy Health has the necessary experience, established professional relationships with agencies and organizations funding health services research of merit, in-depth subject expertise and personnel for this effort. AcademyHealth's personnel are intimately familiar with the design and structure of HSRProj and have both the knowledge and existing relationships with funders from whom data must be obtained for HSRProj. AcademyHealth has been the driving force behind the accepted definition of health services research and has a unique combination of experience and expertise working with public and private funders, professional organizations and researchers within the health services research community through its program of educational workshops on timely health services research and policy issues, national research agenda-setting conferences and seminars and series of scholarly publications.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.&nbsp; However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency. The vendor must posses the knowledge of the programs of NLM and NICHSR in particular. It must have demonstrated in-depth subject knowledge and profound understanding of and experience in developing and shaping the multi-disciplinary field of health services research including health services research methodologies and health policy analysis. The vendor must also have existing positive relationships with the foundations, national and state government agencies, and private organizations that fund health services research and the individuals who influence this research.&nbsp; The capability statement&nbsp;must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL RFP AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ACCEPTING PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIRWARCENACDIV) Lakehurst intends to procure, via full and open competition,  a replacement system for the existing AN/USM-636(V) Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) with a next generation test system solution, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS).

General Description: CASS is a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for automated avionics/electronics testing at Navy Intermediate Level maintenance and Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) sites both shore-based and afloat. Legacy mainframe CASS systems are approaching the end of their useful service life and will be replaced with eCASS. With the replacement of legacy mainframe CASS, reutilization of approximately 750 existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) is required on eCASS while maintaining or improving fidelity of test, run-times and performance. The Offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for CASS TPS migration to eCASS. The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and will also have an eCASS mode that permits taking advantage of the full range of advanced eCASS station capabilities. The program will include delivery of eCASS TPS development suites, which includes a “CASS to eCASS” TPS conversion toolset, and an “eCASS to RTCASS” TPS conversion toolset.

eCASS will be procured as one of two configurations. The first configuration, simply called eCASS, will be designed to assume TPS hosting of all CASS Hybrid, Radio Frequency (RF), High Power (HP), and Communication Navigation Interrogation (CNI) supported TPSs while reutilizing the GFE High Power Device Test Set (HPDTS) and/or GFE CNI Ancillary Set (CNIAS) assets. The second configuration, called eCASS Electro-Optic (EO), will be a logistically common subset of the eCASS configuration that will be designed to assume TPS hosting of CASS EO TPSs (with only the functionality necessary to execute all associated EO TPSs) while reutilizing the GFE CASS EO console asset. Existing and new CASS ancillary equipment shall be used with the eCASS stations to meet the full range of testing currently performed on all mainframe CASS station configurations. eCASS shall be designed for shipboard and shore-based use, and shall be compliant with the eCASS specification and all other applicable documentation.

The contract type is anticipated to be Cost-Plus Incentive Fee for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion with Fixed Price Incentive options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I and LRIP II deliveries. The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include the efforts to design, test and produce fourteen (14) Engineering Development Models (EDMs) to support Design Testing and the Milestone C and Full Rate Production acquisition decisions. Also required are EDM SMAT/CAL OTPS Kits; Calibration Equipment Kits; TPS Development Suites; CASS Qualification Test OTPS; and additional items to support eCASS.  The contract will contain LRIP options to procure up to twenty (20) LRIP I systems in FY13 and up to twenty (20) LRIP II systems in FY14, along with additional items to support the LRIP eCASS systems. 

Respondents are requested to provide comments, requests for clarification and/or other suggestions for consideration, and indicate errors or omissions found in the DRAFT eCASS RFP and all associated attachments. The Government will not share any proprietary information received with any other party outside the Government with the exception of those Government Contractor Support Services (CSS) personnel exclusively supporting the eCASS Program and bound by Non-Disclosure Agreements on file with the Government.  Feedback will not be provided to any Offerors and the Government PCO may or may not, at his sole discretion, incorporate suggestions into the final RFP package. Request that all responses to the draft RFP are submitted in writing such that the date of Government receipt is no later than 17 February 2009.

A technical library, which includes the eCASS Performance Specification and the eCASS System Requirements Compliance Matrix (eSRCM), will be made available only to Offerors who intend to participate as a prime contractor for this effort in accordance with the instructions contained in Paragraph 7.0 Section L of the Request For Proposal.  Due to these items being an Export Controlled documents, they will not be posted within the DRAFT RFP and are only available via such written request.

This procurement will be full and open. The DRAFT solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select “Doing Business” and then “Open Solicitations.”  Look for amendments on the web page.  Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors.  The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 16 January 2009.

<CONTACT>Heather Valiga 301-227-5822
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for National Instruments PXI testing and calibration instrumentation.
The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved.  The NAICS code is 334516.  The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to National Instruments.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). 
The existing instrumentation used for RADIAC Calibration required under the (SE700-AA-MAN-250/RADIAC) RADIAC Equipment Calibration Procedures Manual is no longer available for purchase, or supported for repair, due to non-availability/obsolescence of spare parts.  NAVSEA 04LR, through the In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), researched new equipment for the next generation of testing and calibration instrumentation for the Navy, leading to the selection of National Instruments PXI testing and calibration equipment.  National Instruments has the only PXI equipment that meets all the specifications for RADIAC calibrations.  The Navy has invested in research and development, an obsolescence study, a return on investment analysis, and pilot-test prototypes.  National Instruments is the manufacturer of the PXI testing and calibration equipment and the creator of the LabView software with which the equipment must be compatible.  Award to any other source would result in (a) substa! ntial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received by 31 January 2009, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Heather Valiga by e-mail at heather.valiga@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-3476 on or before 01/31/09.

THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies.  BARDA’s mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN).  
As part of its CBRN medical countermeasure development and preparedness mission, BARDA contemplates a five year Cost Reimbursement, multiple award contract for the advanced development and manufacturing of therapeutics on the path to licensure or market approval (i.e., BLA or NDA, respectively) for the indication of treating neutropenia arising from acute exposure to ionizing radiation, (Acute Radiation Syndrome, ARS).  This announcement will support ARS product development activities on the path to obtaining a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologic License Application (BLA), including:
•  Manufacturing scale-up supporting consistent lot-to-lot manufacturing.
•  Clinical trials, if feasible and ethical.
•  Establishing appropriate animal models, as necessary.
•  Animal studies leading to pivotal animal efficacy data required to support licensure under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “Animal Rule” (“Approval of Biological Products when Human Efficacy Studies are not Ethical or feasible" 21 CFR §601 Subpart H, as well as 21 CFR §314 Subpart I for New Drugs) .

NOTE:  This solicitation does not acquire product for delivery to the Strategic National Stockpile.

In order to be considered eligible to submit a proposal under this solicitation, the Offeror(s) shall meet the following two mandatory criteria for eligibility:  

1) The Offeror shall provide documentation that shows they have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their proposed therapeutic for use in treating neutropenia caused by Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).   Documentation should include, but is not limited to, a cover page, executive summary and a table of contents that demonstrates the Offeror’s intent to file an IND for ARS.  FDA meeting minutes should also be included.  
2) The product in question must be a) licensed or in clinical trials for any indication OR b) have an Investigative New Drug (Application) for ARS (IND; as per 21 CFR 312) filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The proposed product shall not be on clinical hold.

<SUBJECT>POINT OF CARE OR HIGH-THROUGHPUT BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING ABSORBED IONIZING RADIATION DOSE (BIODOSIMETRY) AFTER RADIOLOGIC AND NUCLEAR EVENTS
<SOLNBR>BAA-BARDA-09-36
<CONTACT>Carl A. Newman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-1156 , Fax 202-205-4520, Email carl.newman@hhs.gov - Schuyler T Eldridge, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-1554, Fax 202-205-4520, Email schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov
<DESC>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the
development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for
public health medical emergencies.
BARDA’s mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical
countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN). As
part of its CBRN development and preparedness mission, BARDA announces a program to
encourage research and development aimed at physical and biological dosimetry technologies
useful in initial triage or definitive medical management after radiological and nuclear events. A
large-scale radiological incident would result in an immediate critical need to assess the
radiation doses potentially received by thousands of individuals. This will require a system
architecture or a system of platforms that contains diverse, integrated diagnostic and dosimetric
tools that are accurate and precise. For large-scale events, rapidity and ease of screening are
essential in enabling appropriate triage and treatment decisions.
The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled, “POINT OF CARE OR HIGHTHROUGHPUT
BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING ABSORBED IONIZING
RADIATION DOSE (BIODOSIMETRY) AFTER RADIOLOGIC AND NUCLEAR EVENTS” is to
fund advanced development of innovative physical and biological dosimetry tools and devices,
biomarkers, and bioassays including the development of new indications for already licensed or
cleared products. These tools and devices, biomarkers, bioassays will be used following a
nuclear detonation, use of a radiologic dispersive device (RDD, “dirty bomb”), or other
radiological incident for the assessment of an individual’s absorbed dose of ionizing radiation.
In a mass casualty setting, medical resources will likely be overextended, and comprehensive
clinical and laboratory evaluations to ascertain the subject’s absorbed dose will be critical to
assess medical management needs and appropriate medical countermeasure dosing. In such
circumstances, rapid radiation dosimetry tools will be critically important, particularly in cases
where the demand for approved medical radiation countermeasures and medical attention
exceeds their supply. Rational allocation of such scarce resources will be virtually impossible in
the absence of rapid, reliable diagnostics.
100 PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE
It is the intention of this BAA to award contracts to provide funding for Offerors to advance lead
candidate products in the development pipeline. Each lead candidate product must be
developed to serve as a tool or device, biomarker, or bioassay useful for accurate determination
of a subject’s absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. Advanced development funding from BARDA
shall assist selected candidate products through the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process with
the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiologic Health (CDRH)
and any commensurate studies using the Animal Rule as directed with the Agency’s Centers for
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER).
Offerors are invited to submit proposals that request funding to advance the development of a
promising diagnostic product that addresses this specific research and development area.
Offerors shall propose a well-defined product development path that must include completion
and validation, and potentially approval/clearance, of a prototype instrument or bioassay prior to
or within the five (5) years of the contract period. Performance of studies using vertebrate
animals will be done under the Animal Rule, i.e. 21 CFR §601) and potential clinical studies
must be consistent with all applicable Federal regulations and BARDA/NIH policies and
guidelines for the conduct and oversight of research in vertebrate animals and human subjects.
This announcement will also support product development activities that are enabling for FDA
approval or license of tools, devices, and bioassays, including:
1) Prototype development and manufacturing scale-up of the tool, device, or bioassay.
2) Animal studies required to support the PMA under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) “Animal Rule” (21 CFR §601; New Drug and Biological Drug
Products; Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human
Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible: http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/humeffic.pdf .
Offerors may submit one proposal per designated product entity that addresses the intent of the
BAA and focuses on the development of a single product. However, Offerors may submit more
than one proposal.
Once a novel radiation-responsive biomarker is qualified, the development of a diagnostic test
and the validation of a biomarker(s) assay will usually fall under OIVD (Office of In Vitro
Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety) (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/oivd) / for clearance or
approval of diagnostic tests that measure biomarkers in a clinical setting. The web site “Device
Advice” is available from the FDA at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice, for useful information
about the regulation and review of medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic devices.
It is anticipated that studies in this contract will involve novel radiation-responsive biomarkers
and bioassays which will involve animal studies under the FDA’s “Animal Rule” (21 CFR §601)
for the generation of radiation-responsive biomarkers to known doses of ionizing radiation.
These studies are expected to be supported using Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees (IACUC) as endorsed by the US Food and Drug Administration
(http://www.iacuc.org/index.htm), the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW)
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm), and overseen by the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/index.shtml ).
The following types of proposals are not responsive to this initiative:
&#56256;&#56451; The development of tools, devices and bioassays intended solely for occupational
radiation exposures (<100 mSv),
&#56256;&#56451; The development of devices or bioassays with high levels of inter-individual variability;
101 PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE
&#56256;&#56451; The development of devices or bioassays using biomarkers with highly unstable signal
(i.e. appear and diminish in < 24 hours post-exposure to ionizing radiation),
&#56256;&#56451; The development of devices or bioassays that cannot be utilized in order to estimate
whole-body absorbed dose, and
&#56256;&#56451; Proposals involving the development of animal models for bioassay discovery unless the
models are directly relevant to the dosimetric product development.
Although the above mentioned research and development areas are not responsive to this
announcement, they may be relevant to other BARDA or NIAID Biodefense research and
development programs. A listing of such programs can be found on the BARDA web site
http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/barda or the NIAID Biodefense funding website:
http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/
The class to which your device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of
premarketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market
(http://www.fda.gov/CDRH/DEVADVICE/3122.html). Device product classifications can be
found by searching the Product Classification Database,
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm. The database
search provides the name of the device, classification, and a link to the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), if any. The CFR provides the device type name, identification of the device,
and classification information.
For each of the devices classified by the FDA, the CFR gives a general description including
the intended use, the class to which the device belongs (i.e., Class I, II, or III), and information
about marketing requirements. Each device should meet the definition in a classification
regulation contained in 21 CFR 862-892(see FDA web site:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/313.html). If a Premarket Approval (PMA) is not required, the
Offeror’s must submit a 510(k) to FDA unless the device is exempt from 510(k) requirements of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and the device does not exceed the
limitations of exemptions in .9 of the device classification regulation chapters (e.g., 21 CFR
862.9, 21 CFR 864.9). Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the
form of a letter, from FDA which finds the device to be Substantially Equivalent, and states that
the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order "clears" the device for commercial
distribution.
In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD)
IVDs are medical devices that analyze human body fluids, such as blood or urine, to provide
information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a disease. The device classification for
these devices can be found under 21 CFR 862, 21 CFR 864, and 21 CFR 866.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) of 1988
In addition to FDA regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, IVD devices are also
subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988. This law
established quality standards for laboratory testing and an accreditation program for clinical
laboratories.
The requirements that apply vary according to the technical complexity in the testing process
and risk of harm in reporting erroneous results. The regulations established three categories of
102 PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE
testing on the basis of the complexity of the testing methodology: a) waived tests, b) tests of
moderate complexity, and c) tests of high complexity. Laboratories performing moderate- or
high-complexity testing or both must meet requirements for proficiency testing, patient test
management, quality control, quality assurance, and personnel. These specific requirements do
not apply to tests in the waived category.
Product Complexity Database
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCLIA/search.cfm
Labeling
Specific labeling requirements for IVDs can be found under 21 CFR 809. Additional guidance
can be found under "Device Advice - Labeling Requirements for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices."

POSITION DESCRIPTION:  HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADVISOR, USAID/ETHIOPIA

A.  BACKGROUND

USAID/Ethiopia’s Health, AIDS, Population and Nutrition (HAPN) Team implements programs in health, with HIV/AIDS constituting the largest portion of the health program, at over $200 million for FY 2008/9.  The health portfolio covers child survival (immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood illnesses, nutrition), reproductive health (family planning, safe motherhood), and infectious diseases (tuberculosis, malaria).  HIV/AIDS activities are implemented through the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which includes programs in primary prevention of HIV, Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), palliative care, antiretroviral Treatment (ART), HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT), and other care and support programs.  USAID’s malaria activities are implemented with funding from the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in the areas of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs), Intermittent Presumptive Treatment (IPT) and case management using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

Along with the GFATM, PEPFAR/Ethiopia is by far the largest donor for HIV/AIDS programs in the country, and around 60% of the total PEPFAR budget is managed by USAID.  Supply chain activities managed by USAID include the single largest agreement in the PEPFAR portfolio. USAID’s health program in Ethiopia is also substantial, with the agency again well placed as one of the largest donors.  The largest proportion of USAID/Ethiopia health sector funding, over $120 million in fiscal year 2008/9, is provided through PEPFAR. This multi-agency program is implemented under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia, and is guided by a national Executive Committee.  The USG PEPFAR team maintains close links to Ethiopia’s national AIDS coordination structures within the MOH, in particular the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) and the Programming and Planning Department (PPD), as well as other key line Ministries including the Ministries of Education; Youth and Sports; and Women and Social Affairs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Interested concerns with the ability to provide identical or equivalent data files inclusive of current and historical average wholesale prices of all drugs on the market may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the products required.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILALBE.  Requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

GSA is conducting an Advisory Multi-Step Process in accordance with FAR Part 15.202.  Step One in this process, GSA is requesting interested parties to submit the information specified in this notice. Once received, the Government will then evaluate the information utilizing the criteria provided below. After completion of the evaluation, the Government will notify, in writing, each firm whether the Government believes, based upon the submission, it would likely be a viable competitor in the resultant acquisition which GSA expects to conduct. Any potential offeror that provides a written response to this Advisory Multi-Step Presolicitation Notice may, at its election, participate in the expected resultant acquisition regardless of the advice provided by the Government in response to its submission.  Any parties contemplating participation in the resultant acquisition are strongly encouraged to participate in this Advisory Multi-Step Process. The resultant acquisition will be limited to US sources.

Proposals will be ranked in accordance with technical ratings combined with the offered price.  
The technical evaluation factors, which have equal importance, are:
        (1)	Past Performance on similar projects

<DESC>The Rock Island Contracting Center (RICC) has a requirement for the fabrication and delivery of the M18 and AN-M14 grenade tops and bodies.<BR><BR>The M18 is a burning type hand grenade used to generate colored smoke. The grenade is comprised of two sheet metal components, a deep drawn, cylindrical body, approximately 2.3 inches in diameter and 4.5 inches in height and an undulated circular top (or cover) containing a formed threaded, internal, center hole.  The two components are specifically formed to accept each other during a subsequent double rolled can seaming operation at the grenade final assembly.   The top and body components are made from drawing-quality, electrolytic tin-coated steel sheet in accordance with ASTM A599.<BR><BR>The metal components, namely the top and body, of the M18 Smoke Grenades and the AN-M14 Incendiary Grenade are dimensional identical.  The components of both grenades use the exact same material (electroplated tin deep drawing steel sheet) and deep draw processes for manufacture.  The only small physical difference between the AN-M14 and the M18 metal body is the absence of a bottom center core hole.  During the M18 body manufacture, the center core hole is punched out at the final trim stage of the production process.  In producing the AN-M14 body, the component manufacturer would simply disable the punch operation, thus producing the same body without a center core hole.<BR><BR>The production requirements are a minimum rate of 60,000 per month and the rate must be sustained for the next five years.  First article samples will need to be produced for government evaluation and approval.  RICC intends to issue a Request for Proposal, W52P1J-09-R-0060, to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Website, http://acquisition.army.mil on or about February 4, 2009 with an opening date 30 days after issuance.  This contract will be restricted as a small business set-aside, NAICS code 332993 with a small business classification size of 1500 employees or less.  Drawings for technical data are Distribution X and available to only those firms registered with the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP).  For information on becoming certified, see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.  Restricted technical data will not be forwarded to a contractor who has not been certified.  A copy of the Certified DD Form 2345 is required to be submitted in order to receive the drawings.  All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense (DOD) must be registered in the Central Contractors Register (CCR).  If you are not registered in CCR, you cannot be awarded a DOD Contract.  You may register via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Interested firms are invited to submit proposals after the solicitation is posted to the web.  Technical data will be made available AFTER the solicitation has been posted.  It will be the responsibility of the contractors to check the website for the issuance and any changes to the solicitation.  Direct any questions or inquiries in writing to:  Sheila Peters, Sheila.Peters@conus.army.mil, 309-782-0703.<BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a Sources Sought announcement in support of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Drug and Health Plan Choice (CPC).  CMS is seeking a business that shall be responsible for managing drug information from common data files used for purposes of prescription drug event (PDE) processing, formulary and pricing file submissions, Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder (MPDPF) display, and production of public use files. 

 Per FAR 19.502-2 if through this market research it is determined that there are two or more small businesses that can perform this requirement it will be set aside for small business.

 
Background:

CMS is responsible for regulating and overseeing the implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit by Part D sponsors.  This responsibility includes ensuring accurate payment to Part D sponsors, ensuring beneficiaries have access to a broad range of medically appropriate drugs through formularies that do not substantially discourage enrollment by certain groups of beneficiaries, and ensuring that the MPDPF displays accurate formulary and pricing information to assist beneficiaries with choosing to enroll in a Part D plan.  These payment, formulary and MPDPF related activities require CMS to collect drug specific information from Part D sponsors.  

CMS collects Prescription Drug Events (PDEs) through its Drug Data Processing System (DDPS) for each Part D claim paid by a Part D sponsor.   The PDE consists of approximately 40 data elements from the claim, one of which is the National Drug Code (NDC) for the dispensed drug product.  CMS has established edits in DDPS to prevent Part D sponsors from submitting PDEs for drug products that do not meet the definition of a Part D drug.  These edits will reject PDEs for non-Part D drugs so that associated dollar amounts will not be considered for purposes of determining risk sharing amounts and paying reinsurance.  Currently, CMS establishes edits on NDCs from its common table that represents a comprehensive compilation of NDCs from First DataBank and Medi-Span.  

CMS requires Part D sponsors to submit their formularies for review and approval.  CMS created the Formulary Reference File (FRF) tool to streamline the formulary submission and review process.  Currently, the FRF is a list of proxy national drug codes (NDCs) that Part D sponsors choose from to identify the Part D drugs that are included on their formularies.  The drugs identified on the Part D formularies will be used for display on the MPDPF and will be incorporated into the public use file(s) (PUF). Beginning in 2010, CMS will be changing the FRF to a list of RxNorm codes in place of proxy NDCs.  However, Part D sponsors will still be required to submit an NDC on their pricing file for purposes of pricing display on the MPDPF.  This pricing file will consist of representative NDCs that are cross walked to the FRF RxNorm codes.   


Task Description:

The Contractor will be responsible for managing drug information from common data files used between the Medicare Plan Payment Group (MPPG), Medicare Drug Benefit and C & D Data Group (MDBG), and Office of Beneficiary Information Services (OBIS) for purposes of PDE processing, formulary and pricing file submissions, MPDPF display, and the production of public use files.  The contractor will coordinate the maintenance and update of the various data files to ensure that the information is accurate and relevant to Part D.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for investigating inquiries related to these data and providing recommendations/solutions as needed.  Specific tasks may include, but are not limited to, the following:  

•	Develop and maintain drug information for the FRF, MPDPF pricing files, PDE edits and public use file(s) in accordance with CMS requirements.
•	Develop and maintain the FRF tool using RxNORM data in accordance with CMS requirements.
•	Develop and maintain an RxNORM to NDC crosswalk for NDCs included on the FRF, MPDPF pricing files, and PDE common table in accordance with CMS requirements.
•	Develop and maintain representative NDCs for pricing files in accordance with CMS requirements.
•	Evaluate new drug additions and deletions to commercial NDC databases utilized by CMS to determine the relevancy and effect on FRF and PDE edits.
•	Develop and maintain RxNORM and NDC based data files for Part D excluded-category and over-the-counter drug products in accordance with CMS requirements.
•	Develop and maintain an NDC to FDA approval crosswalk.

Any potential offeror must demonstrate the following:  

1.	Knowledge and operational understanding of Section 101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA); and relevant parts of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the QI, TMA, and Abstinence Programs Extension and Hurricane Katrina Unemployment Relief Act of 2005.


2.	Knowledge and experience researching drug indications and specialized information using the compendia in the regulation (42 CFR Section 423.100).

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that are qualified to provide: qualitative research, including formative research and product testing; as well as quantitative research, including surveys and data analysis around CMS communications and CMS audiences and that supports communication efforts around CMS programs.  
		
Background:  CMS maintains various communication channels to communicate information about Medicare, e.g. publications, Medicare.gov web site, health fairs, State Health Insurance Programs, advertisements.  CMS utilizes various qualitative and quantitative research strategies to develop, improve and gauge the impact of CMS’s Medicare-specific communication strategies.  

Description of Work: Tasks that may be required primarily focus on conducting appropriate qualitative/quantitative research to support the implementation of CMS Medicare-specific communication efforts, as well as, evaluating consumer communication activities.  Tasks may include, but not be limited to: (1) conducting formative research--both qualitative and quantitative--to collect consumer-based data, segment CMS Medicare audiences into homogeneous groups; (2) conducting consumer research on CMS’s Medicare-specific products or materials to refine messages for targeted audiences; (3) developing and applying quantitative measures to track and/or evaluate the effectiveness of CMS’s Medicare-specific communication efforts that will be performed or authorized by CMS; and (4) conducting increasingly sophisticated branding research to position Medicare for the 21st century.  The challenge of these tasks is they will generally require a quick turnaround and there will be little notice of the exact Medicare research topics before work will need to commence. 

Contractor Requirements:  

The potential offeror must address the following, clearly indicating with adequate detail, information about the company, the company’s experience (within the past five years) and ability to provide all of the numbered points below:

        --program evaluation,
        --experiments or quasi-experiments and
        --secondary analysis of large databases.
			
-Proficiency with the following analytic procedures and techniques:
        --linear regression,
        --logistic regression, 
        --ANOVA or GLM and

<DESC>Notice of Intent to sole source:  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to issue a sole-source order for total solution service to supply and install a Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system to support an ongoing redundancy project for a critical OPM IT system.
The lessor of the facility Iron Mountain has total control over the power infrastructure of the facility and has the most  knowledgeable support functionality to realistically provide the solution without interrupting current operation and functionality of the OPM IT system that the UPS will support.  OPM has determined that the work in question falls under Iron Mountain’s purview because the system will be integrated into the facility power infrastructure; as such a sole source is justified.
Therefore, OPM deems it appropriate to award fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to Iron Mountain Inc.  Iron Mountain is the available responsible source and no other source will be considered.  The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 541513 Facilities (i.e., clients' facilities) support services, computer systems or data processing
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COASTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is not a solicitation for offers, but rather a notice of OPM’s intent to negotiate a sole source award to Iron Mountain, Inc.  However responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice is for information only and my represent the only official notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to Instron 825 University Avenue, Norwood, MA 02062-2643, under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b). Bluehill software is designed to integrate and control the unique hardware configuration in NIST’s existing Instron 5800 mechanical testing system. Bluehill 2 is an upgrade to the current Instron Control Software package.  Because it must match NIST’s specific hardware configuration exactly, the new package must be installed and calibrated by Instron technical personnel. Additionally, Instron is the designer, manufacturer, holder of all copyrights, and sole supplier for the Instron Bluehill 2 Materials Testing software for Instron test systems.  Furthermore, Instron is the exclusive distributor of Bluehill software for Instron test systems. The product must be purchased directly from Instron. Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement; information received on or before January 27, 2009, will be considered by the Government. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.

<DESC>As part of market research activities, on or about January 26, 2009 the Census Bureau anticipates to release a Request for Information (RFI) to the vendor community inquiring about comprehensive mass notification systems.  The mass notification solution must enable the Census Bureau to contact all staff, or selected staff across our organization quickly during the 2010 Decennial Census. The 2010 Decennial Census activities begin in April 2009 and complete in December 2010.  After this date the services would be retained, but for significantly fewer staff.

Vendors responding to the RFI must be able to provide the following information regarding their product:

1)	Does the solution meet the requirements as outlined in the RFI?
2)	Does the solution have a System Certification and Accreditation that meets all current FISMA requirements at the MODERATE level?
3)	Does the vendor have access to a current Security Assessment Report (SAR) on the system that could be provided for review (or a contact at the location holding the SAR that we could contact to review)?
4)	Does the vendor have access to an Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter for the system that could be provided for review (or a contact at the location holding the ATO that we could contact to review)?
5)	How they charge for the service, services provided and base charges per call. 
6)	Are they available on GSA Schedule? 

Some of the key requirements the solution must provide include:

·	Instant message delivery (via cell phone, other phone, email, pager, fax, etc) both separately and/or simultaneously as necessary;
·	The ability to have the people acknowledge the message notification in multiple ways (via the mode they received the notification/via another mode/via a designated call in (toll free) number);
·	The ability to receive real time reports to BOC personnel that indicate who has received the message, the mode in which the message was communicated, whether the message was acknowledged, if the message could not be delivered.  When the message was not delivered or not acknowledged, the BOC requires this information by employee name by office;
·	The ability to prioritize the devices/locations to send the message for each contact (for example, Mary Smith needs her 1st call point to be her cell phone, then home phone, then email).  The system must allow call priorities to be set and modified easily without delay;
·	The ability to group personnel so that communications can be targeted to individual groups, regions, or other geographic breakdowns of the country;
·	The ability to preload the contact database in an easy and automated manner;
·	The ability to easily add new personnel, modify information on existing personnel, and delete personnel as necessary;
·	Polling capability – the ability to send questions to the personnel and have them be able to respond promptly without delay;
·	The ability to have multiple administrators with varying granted access rights, but also the ability to change granted access rights from a central administrative location.  
·	The system must have built in redundancy to mitigate not having fail-over to another system;
·	The system must be available 24/7;
·	Technical support must be available at a minimum, from 7am EST to 10pm PST.

The RFI may contain additional or revised requirements and will also request information regarding customary commercial practices and pricing structure.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, IS APART OF ACTIVITIES IN MARKET RESEARCH, AND IS INTENDED TO ONLY ADVISE INDUSTRY OF THE GOVERNMENT’S ANTICIPATED INTENT TO ISSUE AN RFI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.  NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  A DATE TO RECEIVE RESPONSES WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE RFI ANTICIPATED TO BE ISSUED O/A 1-26-2009.  RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED.  NO PHONE CALLS OR EMAIL PLEASE --NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED UNTIL RELEASE OF THE RFI.

THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU WILL TAKE PROCUREMENT ACTION IN THIS MATTER.

<a href="mailto:yvonne.parson@amedd.army.mil">Medcom Contracting Center North Atlantic</a>
<DESC>(Q) Is there presently an incumbent and what is their name and billable rate?  (A) Yes there is an incumbent and their company name is CR Associates Inc. The contract value is $108,768.00. I cannot give you a hourly billable rate.<BR>(Q) What is the qualifications for the Echo Technician?  (A) In accordance with the Performance Work Statement they require an Associates Degree and Echocardiograph Registry Certification by ARDMS or CCI.<BR>(Q) Who will they be servicing?  Adults and Peds.<BR>(Q) What services will they be performing?  (A) They will be performing a wide variety of complex cardiac ultrasound exams.<BR>(Q) What occupation code-title on the Wage Determination does the Echo Tech fall under?  (A) The closest category on the WD they would fall under is a Radiologic Technologist.  The VA FSS sin is 621-050.<BR>(Q) Part II: Technical Information (page 12) Subfactor 1: Subpart 1 references ER Physicians.  We are assuming this should read Echocardiogram Technician?  (A) I will correct the service name from ER Physicians to Echocardiogram Technician in a amendment.  <BR>(Q) Part II: Technical Information (page 12), Subfactor 1: Subpart 2 references that the contractor is required to submit a backup staffing plan with submission of the Technical Information Volume.  However, the solicitation only calls for 1 FTE Echocardiogram Technician and only makes reference to replacement personnel needed should the absence exceed 11 or more consecutive workdays (PWS 1.3.5).  If backfill is only required for absences exceeding 11 consecutive working days, this subfactor does not seem appropriate for this solicitation.  Is this the Government's intention for the Contractor to address this or was this erroneously included?  (A)  Yes, you still need to provide us information with how you would provide for a backfill in case of an emergency situation or extended absence from your employee whereby you would be able to guarantee the Government assurance that you can keep that position filled.  <BR>(Q) Part II: Technical Information (page 12) and Part I: Technical Evaluation (page 14) seems to contradict each other.  Which section contains the correct evaluation factors?  is it the Government's expectation that the technical response will be Volume I or Volume II of the submittal response?  (A) FAR 52.212-1 addendum tells you what to submit and FAR 52.212-2 addendum tells you how each subfactor will be evaluated.  <BR>(Q)  I have highly qualified an echo technologist who is registry eligible.  All other things being equal, will you even consider this as an option?  (A) When evaluating your proposal, the review board looks at your company qualifications.  Please review the addendums to FAR provisions 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 for what you are to submit and how you will be evaluated.  <BR>(Q) What dollar range are you looking for with the Echo Tech?  (A) I cannot give you a range.<BR>(Q) Does it matter how many submittals you get or how many times it gets modified?  (A) One proposal is acceptable.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-28 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 2008-12-18. NAICS is 326150 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation is for commercial purchase.
<p>-This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>AFFTC/PKEW, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing:</p>
<p>(1200 Ea.) Closed Cell Polyethylene Microwave Pyramidal Flame- Retardant Absorbers.</p>
<p><br />1.0 SCOPE: The 772nd Test Squadron of Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement to provide electromagnetic energy absorption in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF). This capability requires the installation of radar absorbing material (RAM) in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT). This RAM must be of a closed-cell design to minimize release of carbon or foam particles during routine handling. The RAM must be of a durable material able to withstand years of handling operations and strong enough to support 300 pounds or more. This purchase of 24-inch x 24-inch x 24-inch pyramidal absorber (quantity of 1200) is needed to provide the necessary attenuation for the frequencies tested within the BAF.</p>
<p>2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: 1) IEEE Standard 1128 - "Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz." 2) NRL Report 8093.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS:<br />3.1 Testing for Frequency Performance.</p>
<p>3.1.1 Reflectivity Attenuation Testing for RAM: Frequency reflectivity measurements are required for each lot. (A lot is defined as a manufacturing run for which there is no break in production, base materials are mixed from the same supplier's batches, and a mixture operation is not stopped/restarted.) Each lot of RAM shall be uniquely numbered and representative samples tested. The individual RAM pieces must be randomly selected for each lot sample test. The frequency range required for this measurement is from 500 MHz to 18 GHz at normal incidence angle and will be required to meet or exceed the attenuation requirements in the table below. Test samples will be taken from lots throughout all manufacturing runs. Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data shall be delivered for each set of RAM tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested.</p>
<p>Frequency Range 0.5 - 1.0 GHz 1.0 - 3.0 GHz 3.0 - 18.0 GHz<br />Minimum Attenuation 30 dB 30dB-40 dB 40dB-50 dB</p>
<p>3.1.2 Data Delivery Requirements. All data collected for frequency testing must be provided on or before date of RAM delivery. The US Government will not accept any shipments of RAM and/or caps which are not provided with the required associated data upon date of RAM delivery. Each measurement plot must identify by serial number which pieces were tested for that plot. Additionally, a table must be provided to show which serial numbers belong to which lot. Delivered data must include frequency-attenuation graphs.</p>
<p>3.2 Manufacturing Constraints.</p>
<p>3.2.1 Glue lines. Due to the multi-use test nature of the BAF, glue lines are generally undesirable for high frequency BAF tests. If any manufactured RAM will include any seams whatsoever, the seams must be characterized for possible performance degradation. Appropriate data and graphs must be provided. The seam lines are to be specified.</p>
<p>3.2.2 Pyramid Design. The RAM to be purchased for this SOW shall be of standard pyramid design with 9 pyramids per RAM piece for 24"x24"x24".</p>
<p>3.2.3 Footprint Size Tolerance. The BAF is marked with a 4-ft by 4-ft grid that has been permanently scored onto the entire concrete floor. Since this RAM will be placed onto the BAF's 4-ft x 4 ft gridded floor, it is highly desired that the RAM be sized to accurately fit this grid. The RAM shall be manufactured to a 24-inch by 24-inch base with a maximum size tolerance of +0.0 inch/-0.38 inch.</p>
<p>3.2.4 Physical Integrity Requirement. The RAM must not shed or leach carbon and fire retardants through an inherent closed-cell design. All RAM to be purchased as part of this SOW must not shed carbon particles during normal handling -- including dropping an upright piece of RAM from a height of 3 feet onto a concrete surface (with the bottom RAM surface impacting the concrete).</p>
<p>3.3 Delivery Constraints. <br />RAM delivery must be coordinated with the 772nd Test Squadron Director of Operations (772 TS/DO) at (661) 277-6756 or Chief of Test Logistics at (661) 275-5114. Delivery must be scheduled to begin no later than the week of 30 March 2008, although earlier delivery is preferred. The last delivery of the entire order should not exceed 6 weeks from the first delivery.</p>
<p>3.4 Fire Retardancy<br />Independently test the flammability of the RAM's manufacturing method to meet the fire retardancy required by NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3). Additional fire retardancy standards may be used as well such as UL 94 HBF.</p>
<p>3.5 Physical Characteristics for RAM.<br />The physical description of the 24-inch pyramidal RAM is provided in the table below:<br />Overall Height 24 inches +/-0.5 inch<br />Overall RAM Footprint 24 inches square +0.0/-0.38 inch<br />Pyramids per piece 9 per 24" pyramidal <br />Pyramid Shape Standard pyramid<br />Fire Retardancy IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3)<br />RAM Material Closed cell polyethylene<br />3.6 Past Performance Requirements.<br />Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: <br />a. RAM manufactured to similar specifications (SOW Para 3.5).<br />b. Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3).<br />c. Ability to deliver a similar quantity of RAM within the time frame specified (SOW Para 3.3).</p>
<p>3.7 Program Management.<br />The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), James Bartley at 661-277-3948, in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor's ability to meet and satisfy the performance or schedule requirements of this SOW.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  
In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Time and Material quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0024 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28 effective December 12, 2008. This is a Full and Open RFQ under NAICS 541512 with a size standard of $25 million. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. An award will be issued to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on the following: 1. Technical Understanding and Approach. The Government will assess the vendor’s Quality Control methodology; qualifications, experience and suitability of quoted personnel (as demonstrated in formal résumés submitted for all personnel).  As such interested vendor's response must indicate an understanding of the processes and work enumerated in the PWS. 2. Relevant Past Performance.  The Government will assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar, relevant work (including magnitude of the project and the nature of the facility), to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous similar relevant work.  Vendors are requested to submit no more than 5 references for relevant past performance.  Submission should include contact information for ordering entity, including a point of contact, dollar value of contract/order, brief description of work performed, and an explanation of how any performance difficulties were addressed and resolved. If the interested vendor has no relevant past performance, an affirmative statement that no relevant past performance exists must be submitted. 3. Price. The factors of Technical Understanding and Approach and Relevant Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  BACKGROUND: The National Archive and Records Administration (NARA), College Park, MD has a requirement for consulting services related to a joint effort undertaken with the GovDTF (Government Domain Task Force) of the Object Management Group (OMG). REQUIREMENTS: The Performance Work Statement is included as Attachment 1.

NARA anticipates that maximum contractor labor will be needed up to and including presentation of the model to OMG and the initial period of OMG FTF (Finalization Task Force) work.  Following the presentation, the level of contractor labor required will be tied to the success or lack thereof of the presented model as measured by vendor interest and interest in the Federal agency records management community.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Time and Material quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0024 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28 effective December 12, 2008. This is a Full and Open RFQ under NAICS 541512 with a size standard of $25 million. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. An award will be issued to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on the following: 1. Technical Understanding and Approach. The Government will assess the vendor’s Quality Control methodology; qualifications, experience and suitability of quoted personnel (as demonstrated in formal résumés submitted for all personnel).  As such interested vendor's response must indicate an understanding of the processes and work enumerated in the PWS. 2. Relevant Past Performance.  The Government will assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar, relevant work (including magnitude of the project and the nature of the facility), to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous similar relevant work.  Vendors are requested to submit no more than 5 references for relevant past performance.  Submission should include contact information for ordering entity, including a point of contact, dollar value of contract/order, brief description of work performed, and an explanation of how any performance difficulties were addressed and resolved. If the interested vendor has no relevant past performance, an affirmative statement that no relevant past performance exists must be submitted. 3. Price. The factors of Technical Understanding and Approach and Relevant Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

NARA anticipates that maximum contractor labor will be needed up to and including presentation of the model to OMG and the initial period of OMG FTF (Finalization Task Force) work.

While there may be periods of increased need in the months following presentation, it is not anticipated that NARA will require maximum daily contractor support.

<p>1. This amendment changes and clarifies the original BAA.<br />As a result of a question about data sources that can be used in the SCIL Program, we<br />realized that the wording in the BAA could be interpreted differently from what was<br />intended. We are therefore amending the BAA to clarify the types of data that can be<br />used.</p>
<p>The amended BAA text reflects a change to Section 4.A.1.d.; D. Data Sources.<br />Include the documentation required in 6.B.4 (Human Use) and, in addition,<br />provide written verification that all data were lawfully obtained and were either<br />publicly available or collected with informed consent, and, where applicable, that<br />the proposer has a license for use of the data that will cover the proposed<br />activity.</p>
<p>2. The Proposal Validity Period in the Cost Proposal cover sheet information (Section<br />4.A.1.e.) and in the Cost Proposal sample cover sheet is amended to read Cost<br />Proposal Validity Period and to require a minimum validity period of 90 days.</p>
<p>3. The due date for proposals responding to IARPA-BAA-09-01 is changed to January<br />29, 2009.</p>
<p>5. The question period for the BAA is extended to January 22, 2009.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment is to provide the Questions and Answers to vendors.Questions and AnswersEnergy Star TestingRFQ-DC-09---320January 15, 2009
Q1. "EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has a requirement for testing of 40 to 60 Energy Star Residential Light Fixtures and 40 to 60 Energy Star Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs". Does this mean 40-60 individual fixtures and individual lamps or 40 to 60 models of fixtures and models of lamps?
A1.  This would be 40-60 models of fixtures and bulbs.
Q2.  Energy Star specifications state a required sample size for each testing performance parameter.  Will this Performance Work Statement (PWS) require the same sample sizes or will they be different?  Can you specify the sample sizes?
A2.  The sample size will be the same as provided in the product's Energy Star specifications.		Q3.  "All offerors shall submit a fixed rate per test quotation" - Does fixed rate per test quotation mean a separate quotation is required for each performance test parameter or a separate quotation for each product model for testing all performance parameters or one quotation for the entire RFQ?
A3. A separate quotation for each performance test parameter is preferred; however, a separate quotation for each product model for testing all performance parameters is acceptable.
Q4.  "All questions concerning this RFP must be submitted via e-mail to the Contracting Officer only at  gosnell.jody@epa.gov by 2:00 pm on January 15, 2009."  When can we Expect a posted response to our questions?
A4.  Answers will be posted no later than January 16, 2009 at 4:00 pm.
Q5. Section 2.22 Conflict of Interest: Does our company meet the Conflict of Interest Requirements as stated in RFQ-DC-09-00320?
A5.  The vendor must comply with the terms of the PWS' Conflict of Interest requirements and submit the information requested. 
Q6.  Section 3.0 Objectives: "Repeat testing may be requested for some products after initial test results are received.  In addition, other Energy Star products may be tested if OIG determines a need to do so." Are the "Repeat testing" and "other Energy Star products" above and beyond the quantities listed in the introduction paragraph?  If so, can these be quantified as it could impact the cost.  Or should provision be made in the quotation?
A6. The "Repeat testing" and "other Energy Star products" are above and beyond the quantities listed in the introduction paragraph.  These cannot be quantified so provision should be made in the quotation.
Q7.  Section 4.1 Procurement of Energy Star Products: Is it expected that all products/model will arrive at the lab concurrently or will shipment and receipt be staged over time?
A7.  All Residential Light Fixtures will be planned to be shipped concurrently; and all Compact Fluorescent Lights will be planned to be shipped concurrently.
Q8.  Section 4.2 Testing  
A8.  The testing will be performed in accordance with the product's Energy Star's specifications.
Q9.  Section 4.5 Meetings - "4.51 The contractor shall be required to attend various meetings." "4.52 A time will be established for a monthly meeting." Will the various meetings require travel or will they be done by tele-conference?
A9.   Tele-conferencing will generally be utilized for meetings.  If travel is necessary, the OIG will travel to the vendor's site.
Q10.   Section 4.8 Dates - "Product testing for all products should be completed within six (6) months of contract award."
A10.    If the required testing, per the specifications, exceeds the six month period provided in the PWS, the testing period will be amended to account for the additional testing timeframes.
Q11.  Section 4.5 of the RFQ, mentions that the contractor shall be required to attend "various meetings," and "monthly meetings."  Can you please provide more details as to the location, scope, and expected number of the various meetings so that we will be able to properly account for these in our pricing.   Also, will all of these meetings, including the monthly meetings, be in person?  Can any of these meetings be done via phone or other electronic means?  If so, which ones and how many of the meetings?  A11.  Teleconferencing will generally be utilized for meetings.  If travel is necessary, the OIG will travel to the vendor's site.
Q12  Is the contractor expected to test all of the requirements of the Energy Star specification including tests such as electromagnetic interference (EMI), maximum mercury content, UL safety testing, and surge testing?  Please let us know if there any tests required under the Energy Star qualification that we will not be expected to perform.  
A12.  The testing will be performed in accordance with the product's Energy Star's specifications.
Q13.  The RFQ states that all testing must be completed within 6 months, and the all deliverables completed within one year.  However, there are a number of tests required under the Energy Star Specification that may take over a year to complete for various products (depending upon the rated life of the product), these include rated life lumen maintenance tests, interim life tests, and average rated lamp life tests. If a product is selected that will require longer than 6 months to complete the testing, will we be given a time extension on the contact to complete this work?  Should we base our price on the assumption that we will be testing only short-rated-life products where all testing can be done in less than 6-months, or should we assume that a representative portion of products will be longer-rated-life products, which will require longer testing period for some Energy Star criteria? 
A13.  If the required testing, per the specifications, exceeds the six month period provided in the PWS, the testing period will be amended to account for the additional testing timeframes.

<DESC>** This synopsis was updated on Friday, January 16, 2009.  Updates are listed at the end of this Description. **

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a competitive IDIQ contract for technical expertise support services in the following three program areas:

Program Area 1: Creating and Disseminating Integrity Management Knowledge
The Contractor must provide necessary technical, management, and administrative services to support PHMSA in generating and promoting knowledge to IM decision makers.  This initiative is intended to increase PHMSA’s and pipeline stakeholders’ awareness of new technology, effectiveness of consensus standards incorporated into Parts 192-195 of PHMSA’s regulatory program, and to organize and conduct selected PHMSA public events and growing need in assessing quality from multiple program outputs.

Program Area 2: Cross Border and International issues and Frontier Region Assessments
PHMSA’s cross border coordination is growing through a recent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Arrangement with the Canadian National Energy Board. Understanding and quantifying differences between North American pipeline operations is important before an implementation strategy for harmonizing IM inspections and audits and consistent application of consensus standards is created.  Challenges also exist in frontier regions (i.e., Arctic) where identification and quantification of information to PHMSA decision makers is greatly desired. 

Program Area 3: Technical Support during Pipeline Emergencies
Major pipeline failures and natural disasters can occur.  Immediately after these events, PHMSA emphasizes significant attention to technical and regulatory detail so appropriate corrective action orders are generated rapidly.  In some cases, on-site collection of technical and photo details is required so mission critical actions are not delayed.

This is a competitive small business set-aside under the NAICS Code 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.  The period of performance will be for one base year with four possible option years.
  
** UPDATED AS OF FRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 2009 **
(1) Total estimated value of the requirement is $2.4 million (over a possible five-year period of performance).  
(2) Estimated issue date of the solicitation package will be on or around January 23, 2009, with an estimated closing response date on or around February 25, 2009.

Edits include:
-- Changed title of Program Area 1.
-- Removed reference to contract award date.

The correct response date is 30 January 2009.***<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>The Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) program provides the army and other military services and government agencies with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from RCIEDs.  The CREW program is comprised of numerous systems, which fill a wide range of the electronic warfare requirements.  The CREW systems protect the members of U.S. forces operating in, or primarily stationed in Iraq, and Afghanistan in support of U.S. operations in the Global War on Terrorism including Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). <BR><BR>The Product Manager, CREW has identified the need for CLS Support for the AN/VLQ-14(V) 1, Mobile Multi Band Jammer (MMBJ) 2.1 System (approximately 3,000 Systems).

This CLS requirement is based on a directive from the Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) that is the oversight authority for CREW product development and production.  JIEDDO has officially established that once the CREW systems (like the MMBJ) have completed fielding and are designated for transition to a particular service, then it becomes that services responsibility to support, sustain and maintain these systems.  Within the Army, PM CREW has been identified to become the service organization responsible to provide these critical and timely support functions for the MMBJ 2.1.       <BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM LCMC is conducting this market survey to determine price and availability from potential sources capable of fulfilling a 5 Year Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) effort.
