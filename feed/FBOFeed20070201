<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC intends to issue a 24 month sole source award for methods consultation for the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP).  CDC will provide technical assistance in the development of a sampling plan that derives a national, population-based estimate of persons in care for HIV infection (the MMP), as well as a national sampling that results in the selection of the eligible grantees for the MMP.  The project?s multistage cluster sampling design is complicated and the field is a very specialized one. CDC must consult with researchers who have successfully implemented these methods.  In particular, CDC seeks to continue to involve experts who have designed and conducted a national multistage probability sample of persons in care for HIV infection and who therefore are uniquely qualified to provide technical assistance with the implementation of the sampling on a national and local (i.e., eligible grantees) level, and to provide ongoing input into operational issues.  The CDC has identified the Rand Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, California, as the sole source to provide the requirement.  Responsible sources who believe they can provide the required services may submit a written capability statement, via e-mail, no later than 10 days from the published date of this announcement.  
Also, submit a written response demonstrating your qualifications, as they pertain to each of the following six minumim requirements.  (1) Five years experience working with state and local health department HIV/AIDS surveillance programs or projects.  (2) Doctoral level staff with knowledge, expertise or degrees in sampling statistics and specializing in the design, implementation and operationalization of complex multi-stage probability sampling methods.  (3)  Three years of experience implementing project area, facility and patient sampling methods that successfully resulted in nationally representative data characterizing medical conditions among a specific population within the United States.  (4) Two years of direct experience evaluating facility and patient sampling frames and providing representative samples of facilities and patients to state and local health department officials.  (5) Knowledge of CDC?s stringent security and confidentiality guidelines for HIV/AIDS surveillance and experience receiving and transferring data using secure systems.  (6) Proven success in the collection of nationally representative medical or health data on HIV-infected patients, demonstrated by the publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts in scientific journals describing the statistical methods and estimates of clinical outcomes from multi-stage sampling projects involving HIV-infected patients in care.  Telephone inquiries will be considered nonresponsive.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region has a requirement for Architect/Engineering Services for drinking water systems and wastewater systems within the region.  The work required includes water and wastewater system design, contract document preparation, engineering reports, independent design review, construction technical assistance, troubleshooting, project design management, technical assistance in securing approvals for designs from State and other agencies, and other similar work.

As support for these services, any A-E contractor receiving award of a contract will be required to provide professional Electrical Engineering for power system and control systems (both relay and PLC based) and professional Mechanical Engineering.  Qualifications and experience in Sanitary Engineering; Structural Engineering; Cross Connection Control; green energy design and development (such as recycled products, photovoltaic power, fuel cell power, wind or hydro power) will be advantageous.

Typical water and wastewater systems are small and not the usual municipal system.  Often Forest Service water and wastewater systems are in remote locations, seasonally operated and lack commercial power or phone.  They serve campgrounds, day use areas, visitor centers, maintenance facilities, employee housing, offices, warehouses, research laboratories and air tanker bases.  The size of facilities served may be as small as one single family residence or may be as large as a site with multi-family housing, offices, warehouse, work center and a visitor center.  The complexity of the water systems range from simple groundwater wells and springs with a storage tank to more complex surface sources with a water treatment plant.  Wastewater systems range from onsite residential primary treatment and disposal (such as septic tanks, disposal trenches and lagoon systems) to more advanced treatment processes required for nitrogen removal at the air tanker bases or multi-stage sewage treatment plants.

Project locations are on or near National Forests throughout Region Six, which includes areas in both eastern and western Oregon and Washington as well as areas in western Idaho.  The Forest Service intends to award to a mix of firms to assure a variety of expertise and geographic locations near project sites.  

An Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) type contract will be negotiated and awarded with a base period not to exceed three years from the date of award. Delivery orders will be competed among the firms receiving award of a contract.  The Government anticipates awarding four contracts as a result of this advertisement, but may make fewer or more awards in order to assure the most advantageous arrangement of firms to meet the Governments needs.  One of the four anticipated awards is set aside for competition among Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and is being advertised as AG-05K3-S-07-0006.  Contract ceilings will not exceed $350,000.00.  The minimum guarantee is $15,000.00 for the contract period.

The following factors will be used for the purpose of evaluation and determination of the most highly qualified firms, among which the awardees will be selected.  Submitted SF 330?s should address these areas specifically:

1) Professional qualifications.  A professional licensed Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer and Mechanical Engineer is required in the State of Oregon and/ or Washington.

2) Specialized experience and technical competence for the type of projects discussed above.

3)  Capacity to accomplish multiple task orders in the required time.

4) Past performance on contracts with similar work for Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.

5) Location in the general geographic area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project.

To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in both the Central Contractor Registration Database (http://www.ccr.gov) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (http://orca.bpn.gov).  

Firms qualified and interested in providing the A-E services described in this synopsis are invited to submit Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire in one (1) original and three (3) copies with the appropriate data.  Parts 1 and 2 must be completed and submitted for all contractors and subcontractors or consultants.  No faxed, electronic, telegraphic or telephonic submittals will be accepted.  Interested parties can submit their information to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 10600 NE 51st Circle, Vancouver, WA 98682; attn: Justin Holder, Contracting Officer.  Please label your information USFS R6 Water/Wastewater IQC.  Deadline for receipt of responses is 3:00 P.M. local time, March 5, 2007.

<DESC>This effort will provide competency-based training capabilities focused on teams responsible for developing air and information operations strategy, plans, and tasking.  Currently, the primary method for training operational planners is through large-scale exercises such as Ulchi Focus Lens and Blue Flag and through internal mission qualification training.  These exercises, while providing useful experience, are not focused on improving the competencies, knowledge, and skills of the individuals and teams participating in the exercise.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is currently focused on expanding process and application skills and developing theater specific knowledge.  This effort will demonstrate technologies to develop the cognitive readiness for operational planners based on the competencies, knowledge, and skills identified for the Strategy and Combat Plans divisions of the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC).  This immersive training environment will provide Air Operations Groups with a training capability which does not currently exist and will provide a means to measure and certify combat readiness for operational planning teams.

<DESC>DHS S&T will consider a broad range of technologies but this HSARPA BAA focuses on the high risk/high payoff development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than advances in basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components. Instead, they may be new or existing technologies integrated into existing systems and/or subsystems in unique and innovative ways. Offerors should demonstrate that their efforts are aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 2-5 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to homeland security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that developments in these areas must work towards the goal of producing an operational demonstration during which the SAFECON products will interact seamlessly with existing commercial systems and processes.  An initial capability demonstration is desirable within the first six months after contract award.

<DESC>PR Number(s): 2915013432931PR, FA810406R0598 Item: 0001 NSN: 2915013432931PRPR SENSOR,TEMPERATURE, P/N: 1534M60P04,  Description: Temperature is sensed by a helium-filled sensing coil acting upon sensing bellows attached to a metering valve.  A second bellows is reference bellows.  Pressurized helium gas in sensing coil reacts to temperature changes.  When temperature increases, gas pressure increases. When temperature decreases, gas pressure decreases.  Control servo pressure (PC) is supplied through a fixed orifice in main engine control.  Pressure between fixed orifice and metering valve is P6 Pressure.  Pressure (P6) is regulated to that required to overcome force of helium acting on sensing bellows, plus force of preload springs, plus force of bypass pressure (PD) acting on reference bellows.  This interaction of forces regulats P6 at a constant value above PD at a constant value above PD at a given temperature. An increases in temperature expands helium gas in sensing coil and sensing bellows.  As sensing bellows expands, opening at metering valve is decreased.  A smaller amount of P6 is than blec to PD, thus increasing P6 pressure.   A temperature decrease in helium-filled sensing coil causes gas to contract.  As gas contracts, metering valve opens farther, bleeding more P6 pressure to PD, and P6 pressure decreases.  The reference bellows allows for variations in PD and is used to maintain absolute pressure reference. FUNCTION:  The sensor is a temperature sensor and transducer unit for main engine control.  It responds to changes in fan discharge temperature and regulates pressure as a function of discharge temperature.  DIMENSIONS: 'Sensor body/length 3.000inches, width 4.390 inches, height 2.400 inches. Temperature coil dimensions:  length 7.188 inches, width 2.750 inches, height 2.750 inches, weight (dry) 2.82 lbs, signal pressures 24.1-182.4 PSI above main fuel pump boost pressure and proportional to temperature, filter screen size 70 microns (nominal), pressure line  connection0.562-18 UNF-3A thread, temperature range -65F to 480F.  MATERIAL:  consists of aluminum exterior surfaces anodized per MIL-L-8625 class I Type II. Total Line Item Qty:10-20,21-32    Destn: FB2039,Tinker AFB,OK.,73145-9013.

<DESC>The Aircraft Structures Commodity Council at Robins AFB, GA is pleased to announce a strategic enterprise-wide long term strategy for Bonded Aircraft Structures in Federal Stock Class 1560.   Our intent is to consolidate individual competitive tactical buys into multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) firm fixed price contracts for a 10 year period.  IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY FURNISHED A BONDED PART TO THE GOVERNMENT IN FEDERAL STOCK CLASS 1560, YOU WILL NEED TO READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY TO DETERMINE IF YOUR ITEMS ARE INCLUDED.

This strategy is divided into items for a small business set aside and items for a full and open competition.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.

<DESC>This solicitation is being issued as a result of The General Services Administrations completion an Administrative Support Function (ASF) competitive sourcing study under OMBs Circular A-76 for the Public Buildings Service work performed in the Central Office.    Competitive Sourcing, or the OMB A-76 review process, is part of the Presidents Management Agenda.   The process allows an agency to develop a proposal known as the Most Efficient Organization (MEO), which is compared against a theoretical cost of contractor performance known as the Estimated Contract Price.  The result of this competition will allow us to manage administrative support activities more effectively, as well as ensure that the government and taxpayer alike are getting the most for their money.

The Requirement Document (RD) for this study identified 29 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions whose work was captured in the RD.  Of the 29 positions, 11 were government and 18 were contractors.

On September 8, 2006 it was announced that the Agency Provider Most Efficient Organization (MEO) was the performance decision.  The MEO will require 8 Government FTE and 14 contract administrative support positions.  By April 2, 2007 the MEO must be in place.   As a result of the MEO being the performance decision of the study, all GSA Central Office's Administrative Support Function contracts will not exercise options to exceed March 30, 2007, so that the MEO may be implemented by the deadline.

GSA, Central Office seeks to establish a single award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle, thru this solicitation, to satisfy the administrative requirements under the MEO.

The cut off date for questions concerning the solicitation will be February 8, 2007, by 12:00 PM EST and shall be submitted to aliza.brown@gsa.gov.  Responses to questions will be publicized in an amendment to the solicitation.

The date for receipt of proposals is February 19, 2007, by 3:00 PM EST.  For questions please contact Lisa Brown on (202) 208-3214 or via email at aliza.brown@gsa.gov.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS). FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies. In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR. The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Since October 1, 2003 it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via https://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink. At a minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: Your company?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Power Identification Number (MPIN), which you can get from your company?s CCR point of contact, your company?s DUNS number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B number), your telephone number and e-mail address.

Also, beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information at your convenience via the internet at http://orcap.bpn.gov. Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.

<DESC>OFFICE OF FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE OVERSIGHT
PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
HUD-OFHEO-2007-0001

The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the oversight agency for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is conducting a two-phase competitive acquisition for the purchase of data (and possibly software) related to losses from operational events.  A vendor may provide information in response to this notice on the data, the software or both the data and software.  Operational losses include direct and indirect losses associated with the operational risk exposure of a firm including those related to legal liability, reputational setbacks, and compliance and remediation costs where such losses are consequences of operational events.  Operational risk is the exposure to loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events.  

The data will be used to analyze the losses associated with operational events at financial institutions.  In addition, OFHEO intends to develop quantitative approaches for determining the adequacy of capital held against operational risk.  Increased understanding of operational loss events and their implications for capital reserves will directly support the conduct of OFHEO?s oversight responsibilities. 

1.	OFHEO is looking for data that, at a minimum, shall:

a.	Provide relevant information on the organization suffering the loss such as asset size, type of institution, and major business lines;
b.	Provide a loss amount using U.S. dollars;
c.	Provide the loss date;
d.	Provide the Basel risk category and risk type identifiers;
e.	Provide the Basel business unit identifiers; 
f.	Cover the financial services industry in the United States; and
g.	Be available in a format that can be used with a variety of analytical tools.

2.	At a minimum, OFHEO requires software with preprogrammed capabilities to:

a.	Scale loss data from different sources to improve consistency (for example by some measure of an institutions? size or risk exposure);
b.	Perform a variety of approaches to model economic capital, including the loss distribution approach (LDA);
c.	Produce a variety of parametric and nonparametric estimates of the probability density and cumulative distributions of the frequency of operational losses;
d.	Produce a variety of parametric and non parametric estimates of the probability density and cumulative distributions of the severity of operational losses;
e.	Incorporate scenario analysis;
f.	Produce analyses of business line and Enterprise level risk exposures and economic capital requirements; and
g.	Facilitate sensitivity analysis and robustness checks of those analyses.

3.	In order to ensure that only those vendors who have the capability of providing the services required, OFHEO is using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.202, ?Advisory Multi-Step Process?.  The two-phase approach consists of submission of corporate capability statements and participation in oral presentations (Phase I), and submittal of written technical and cost/price proposals (Phase II):

a.	Phase I:  Interested contractors/vendors will provide limited information in response to subparagraphs 1 and/or 2 above, that should be readily available on the following:

I.	Corporate Capability Statement:  List of services/products commercially available, or that can be available by the contract performance due date, that comply with this pre-solicitation notice.  The Corporate Capability Statement shall be no longer than 4 type written pages.  

II.	Past Performance Information:  References from at least 3 customers, of which at least 2 will be for contracts that have been completed, one may be on-going.  The work must be similar in nature to this requirement.

III.	Confirmation of the vendor?s availability to participate in Oral Presentations.  The oral presentations are an informal discussion between the vendor and the government.  It is anticipated that the discussions will assist OFHEO in the development of the final Statement of Need.  No discussion of cost will be allowed at this phase

a.	Oral presentations will be held approximately 4 weeks from the date of this posting.  Invitees will be given morning and afternoon options for presentation times.  Invitees may participate either on-site at OFHEO, or via telephone;

b.	Oral presentations will be limited to 2 hours in length; and

c.	If the vendor?s product is not a fully developed commercial, off-the-shelf product, the vendor?s key personnel (i.e., subject matter expert) responsible for development of the product shall participate in the oral presentations.

b.	Phase II:  OFHEO shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated above, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to submit a written technical and cost/price proposal or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  OFHEO shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion and state that notwithstanding the advice provided by OFHEO in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.

The items will be delivered to Norfolk, VA.  This procurement will utilize Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request For Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  Numbered notes 22 applies.

The annual fee for any year may not exceed $1,500,000 and per project limitation is $1,000,000.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $4,500,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated date of contract award is May 2007.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for studies of electrical power utility distribution, transmission, and generation systems, SCADA control systems, and energy studies in tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam and Pacific Ocean Areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for studies of electrical power utility distribution, transmission, and generation systems, power system/quality analysis, SCADA control systems, and energy studies in tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam and Pacific Ocean Areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 07 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB and .13% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2005).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.  The submittal/delivery address is Commander, Code NAVFAC PAC ACQ11 (A-E Solicitation No. N62742-07-R-0012), Attn:  Mailroom (MS2), NAVFAC PACIFIC, 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860-3134.  This address is for all deliveries, including US Mail, courier service and/or personal delivery services; no other address is acceptable.  The delivery address is inside a military installation, therefore, strict securities measures are in force; anticipate delays.  Interested firms must allow sufficient time for receipt of submission.  Consultants to the prime A-E firm are required to submit only Part II of the SF 330.  This solicitation requires all interested firms to have an email address.

<RESPDATE>012306
<CONTACT>Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-4379, Fax 301-402-0642, Email rhwilli@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole-source basis with Technical Resources International Inc. (TRI) under the authority of FAR 6.302 for
computerized information support services to maintain and enhance the Chemical  carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS).  The mission of the NLM Division of Specialized Information Services is to: (1) provide selected core toxicology and environmental health information resources and services; (2) facilitate access to national and international toxicology and environmental health information resources; and (3) strengthen the information infrastructure of toxicology and environmental health.  The CCRIS database is an integral component of NLMs mission to provide biomedical information.  As a primary user and disseminator of the CCRIS data, NLM wishes to transition the responsibility for CCRIS from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to NLM.  NLM will be unable to fulfill this component of its mission without continuation of the current highly efficient and effective computerized information services support.
		
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System) is an online database originally created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  In 1985, CCRIS was mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) system, and the database was maintained using TOXNET data input software.  The database contains data and results of research studies for over 9000 chemical compounds. The chemical - specific data fall into the selected areas of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition.  Full bibliographic references are also included in addition to specific indexing. 

The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the CCRIS database which resides, and may be searched, on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System. The input for this data base
comes from several sources such as:

- Surveillance and review of the published literature (e.g., CASelects)
- IARC Monographs
- NCI/NTP Toxicity and Bioassay Reports
- Applicable database searches

The Contractor shall survey these sources and evaluate pertinent data in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  At the direction of the Project Officer, the Contractor shall enter
suitable studies on chemicals into the CCRIS database.

The software for the maintenance and update of the CCRIS database on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System will be provided by the National Library of Medicine.

General process for CCRIS record building:

A Senior Scientist (Ph.D.) reviews published literature and results of database searches (typically abstracts) and selects potential studies.

An Information Specialist (B.S.) acquires copies of full reports/studies online (e.g., Docline) and at local libraries.  The citations, with a unique reference code, are also added to the reference file and retained for future use.
A Senior Scientist reviews the full reports/studies and determines if the report/study meets the established evaluation criteria.  If determined to be relevant and acceptable, the Senior Scientist codes the relevant data from the study onto standardized code sheets.

The code sheets and the full report/study are reviewed for scientific accuracy and completeness by an expert Peer Reviewer (Ph.D.).  Questions and issues are resolved with the Senior Scientist.

An Information Specialist enters the data from the code sheets into CCRIS using TOXNETs SSEUS data entry system.

A Staff Scientist (M.S.) double-checks (quality control/quality assurance) the data entered against the original code sheets.  Any questions or discrepancies are resolved with the Senior Scientist.  

The log of the periods activity is sent to and reviewed by the Project Manager.  When approved, the Project Manager notifies NLM staff that the entered data is ready for public release.

Monthly reports are generated that reflect monthly activities and related costs.
				
TRI has provided expert information services support, through an NCI contract, to maintain and enhance the CCRIS database since its inception on the TOXNET system in 1985.  TRI has established a strong working relationship with NLM and uniquely understands the utilization of CCRIS data by the scientific community.  TRIs previous 21 years of experience with NCI and NLM have proven critical to the success of the CCRIS database.  This experience with NLM and NLMs SSEUS data entry system uniquely qualifies TRI as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  Therefore there will be no time lost with the usual learning curve or start-up processes.  It is determined that TRI is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints and a compelling need to avoid gaps in the maintenance and enhancement of CCRIS, TRIs continued service is considered a crucial component to the transition of the CCRIS database from NCI to NLM. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) business days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 06-053/RHW.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, NLM on (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to award a sole source contract to Universities Space Research Association (USRA) of Columbia, MD, 21044-3405, for support in the development and performance testing of the platform Telescope Assembly (TA) portion of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) arrayed with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, as well as other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub millimeter observations. The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center). The SOFIA observatory will be the worlds largest and most sensitive airborne observatory. The aircraft will operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet. The telescope will look out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft and allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before. The objective of the TA development and performance testing is to increase the TAs measured performance to meet defined metrics for the SOFIA full operational environment.  This includes mirror coating of the telescope and possible integration and integration testing of the Mission Control System. The authority for other than full and open competition is: only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). USRA is the only responsible source to provide the needed support since approximately 20% of the development and performance testing has been previously accomplished by USRA.  As a result, they are uniquely and intimately familiar with the TA performance and integration characteristics, particularly as they apply to the evolving SOFIA project. Due to the complexities of the SOFIA project and the interrelationships of Government and contractor participants, the time needed to gain this knowledge and expertise would cause unacceptable disruptions to the program.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on February 16, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend the ordering period and increase the maximum ordering value of the Mechanical Systems Engineering Services (MSES) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (NAS5-01090), for the Applied Engineering and Technical Directorate (AETD).  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from Swales and Associates, Inc. on a sole source basis to allow for continuation of the MSES IDIQ contract until the follow-on competitive procurement is awarded. The competitive follow-on procurement is currently on-going due to a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) protest. This extension and increase to the MSES IDIQ contract will allow for the issuance of new task orders and for the continuation of existing task orders in order to avoid negative impacts to ongoing NASA/GSFC missions and flight programs and projects. Swales and Associates, Inc. as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current involvement with complex systems and critical schedules of NASA flight programs such as HST, GOES, JWST, SDO, ST-5, etc.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM AC-Natick Contracting Division, in support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), has identified a need to procure Chemical/Biological (CB) protective overboots.  The overboots are for use by USSOCOM personnel  conducting missions where protection from liquid CB agents, industrial (POL) contaminants, high-friction tasks, and other environmental conditions is required.  The overboot will be used with existing standard military footwear and used in conjunction wit h the All Purpose  Personal Protective Ensemble (AP-PPE) developed for use by USSOCOM personnel.  The overboots must be lightweight, highly-durable, and have integrated chemical and biological liquid, aerosol, and vapor resistance, alone and exposed to PO Ls.  The overboot shall be capable of being worn over existing combat boots, be fabricated in a subdued fabric color, and provide optimal traction.  The soling system shall be designed for comfort and durability.  It is expected that all materials used wil l hold up under the extreme conditions found in hot weather, temperate weather, mountainous operational environments as well as Garrison environments. Materials should be selected to provide CB protection and optimized personnel performance. The Government anticipates a Full and Open Competition acquisition. However, the Government reserves the right to change the solicitation procedures. The Government envisions awarding a single contract.  However, the Government reserves the right to issue more than one contract, or none.  If more than one contract is awarded the requirements will be divided (ratio to be determined) among successful offerors.  The procurement will utilize Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government anticipates issuing a two (2) year Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Inde finite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a single ordering period.  The contract will be awarded in response to the forthcoming Request for Proposals (RFP).   The anticipated initial delivery will be for one thousand five hundred (1,500) pairs. The anticipated  delivery schedule thereafter will be three thousand five hundred (3,500) pairs per month.  Both the initial delivery and anticipated delivery schedule are subject to revision.  The anticipated guaranteed minimum quantity is sixteen thousand eight hundred (16,800) pairs, and the anticipated maximum is twenty thousand (20,000) pairs.  Both the anticipated guaranteed minimum and the maximum quantities are subject to revision.  This pre-solicitation notice closes on 5 February 2007. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals will be released on 6 February 2007.     When released, the solicitation, including all amendments and applicable documents, will only be available in electronic medium at the U.S. Army RDECOM AC-Natick Contracting Division website (https://www3.natick.army.mil). The point of contact for this req uirement is Richard Alves, and can be contacted via e-mail at richard.alves@natick.army.mil.

Background: The U.S. Forest Service (FS), is responsible for protecting National Forest lands from wildland fires and, by agreement with other agencies, assists in protecting other jurisdictions. The Forest Service has acquired 3 excess military aircraft for conversion to airtanker configuration. This contract is to provide an acceptable tank system and its installation for these aircraft.

Scope: This contract is for the purchase and installation of a retardant delivery system for up to 3 Forest Service owned P3B (Heavy) and P3C aircraft. Once installation and performance evaluation is complete,these aircraft would be used as large airtankers for wildland firefighting. The capacity of the retardant delivery system will be commensurate with the load carrying capacity of the aircraft. The volume of the
retardant tank shall be a minimum of 2500 gallons. The work includes design, analysis, installation and testing of the aircraft for conversion to wildland firefighting using a retardant tank. The resultant airtanker conversion shall meet the performance requirements of the Interagency Airtanker Board. Conversion of the aircraft shall occur at the contractor?s facility.

Requirements: The retardant delivery system shall be of new manufacture, externally mounted and a gravity flow design. The retardant delivery system performance shall meet the Interagency Airtanker Board tank system criteria which can be viewed at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/airtankers/iab_procedures/iab_procedures_sec_vii_tank_system.pdf.  The Tank installation shall be approved for use on the P3B (Heavy) and P3C airframe by the Federal Aviation Administration by Supplemental Type Certificate. The tank system shall have serviceable/maintainable life of no less than twenty (20) years.

Tank Installation: The installation of the retardant delivery system will not interfere with or cause disablement of the aircraft environmental systems to include the pressurization of the fuselage. The basic structure of the aircraft shall not be modified to the extent that it cannot be readily returned to its original configuration following removal of the tank and the bomb bay shall remain intact and operational. The installation of the
tank/retardant delivery system shall not alter the speed restrictions of an OEM, as delivered, non modified aircraft by more than ten (10) percent.

Tank Capacity:The capacity of the retardant delivery system shall remain within the Manufacturer or FAA approved normal weight limitations and center of gravity configuration for the aircraft. The approximate volume of the retardant tank should be 2500 to 3000 gallons based on a retardant weight of 9 lbs. per gallon. The
offerors specified tank quantity shall be supported by weight and balance criteria and airframe structural loads engineering analysis.

<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a SOLE-SOURCE contract.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award one and only one contract, on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, to the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), which is located at 2200 Mill Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22314.  It is anticipated that the SOLE-SOURCE award to ATRI will be in the form of a cost-reimbursable contract.  It is estimated that ATRI?s resulting SOLE-SOURCE contract will have a two-year Period of Performance.  Under ATRI?s SOLE-SOURCE contract, ATRI will establish and maintain a freight performance measurement (FPM) research program focused on measuring speed and travel time reliability on freight significant corridors and measuring crossing and delay time at major US international land border crossings.  The data resulting from the FPM program will be used to identify areas of significant freight congestion and bottlenecks.  Another primary use of the data will be to monitor progress in the U. S. Department of Transportation?s (DOT?s) and Federal Highway Administration?s (FHWA?s) strategic objective of global connectivity.  Key objectives of this work are to:  (a) develop and / or refine methods of collecting data on freight travel (congestion); (b) develop tools for analyzing and processing data; (c) derive measures for congestion and reliability; (d) develop data products and tools that will assist DOT, FHWA, and state and local transportation agencies in addressing surface transportation congestion; and (e) develop a rich freight data source that can be used to inform the development of strategies and tactics for managing and relieving freight congestion.  Key facets of the FPM program shall include:  (1) routine reporting of results to support FHWA?s performance measurement and reporting; (2) development of tools and data products that will assist DOT, FHWA, State Departments of Transportation, and other public transportation agencies in managing congestion and bottlenecks in the freight transportation system; (3) development of data products and tools that add value to the freight planning process and freight modeling; (4) analysis of freight travel time data as it relates to delay caused by nonrecurring congestion, with an emphasis on construction / work zones, crashes, breakdowns, extreme weather conditions, and special events; (5) targeted outreach to enhance the public transportation agencies? and private sector organizations? knowledge and understanding of the importance of FPM data (freight-specific, intercity data on travel time); (6) development of a freight travel time database that can be used to guide investment decision at the state and local level and be used by FHWA and DOT to guide national policy and legislation related to freight management; and (7) engagement with state, regional and local transportation agencies and universities conducting transportation research on behalf of transportation agencies in specific projects and case studies that use FPM data.  For the following reasons among others, ATRI alone is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform this SOLE-SOURCE contract.  Through past / related research, ATRI has demonstrated a unique and innovative concept to provide the required services related to collecting proprietary truck travel time data.  ATRI through its unique relationship with the motor carrier industry is able to collect truck travel time data that is regarded as proprietary in nature.  The proprietary data needed for the contemplated FPM effort is deemed to be available only from the original source (technology vendor) used in previous research, and the contemplated FPM effort is a logical follow-on to the previous work.  ATRI is the only transportation research agency that is directly affiliated with the American Trucking Association (ATA).  ATRI?s relationship / affiliation with ATA uniquely positions ATRI to have access to over 35,000 motor carriers through the affiliated trucking associations in 50 states and to foster collaboration and cooperation with the trucking industry----all of which is indispensable to the success of the contemplated FPM effort.   Through this relationship with industry ATRI is able to gain access to proprietary satellite location data and derive non-proprietary data and information on travel speed and travel time reliability.  The ATRI research team processes the proprietary data into non-proprietary data and information that FHWA uses for monitoring performance in one of its strategic goals and to inform decisions on better managing congestion on the surface transportation system.  Employing a new data collection methodology and new source of data would result in issues with accuracy and comparability of data.  Key to being able to meet the agency?s data requirement in a timely manner is the establishment of a long-term contract to facilitate the continuous acquisition of the proprietary data and processing of the data into a non-proprietary format.  Through previous efforts the ATRI research team has demonstrated a unique capability to gain access to proprietary data from commercial trucking firms and to use it to measure travel rates and travel time on freight significant highways in the United States.  The initial research ATRI completed for the FHWA involved the production of a major data management system consisting of highly specialized processing software.  Because of the highly specialized software developed for processing and managing data, and because of the nature of the data (proprietary data that belongs to the freight industry), and because of the unique relationship ATRI has with the trucking industry, and because of the FHWA?s requirement for no lapse in data collection-----ATRI is considered to be the only organization that is capable of performing the contemplated FPM effort.  If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned overwhelming factual basis logically favoring ATRI as the only organization capable of satisfactorily executing the contract envisioned herein, any organization OTHER THAN ATRI believes that it can perform this project, then any such other organization shall submit one HARD-paper original and 10 HARD-paper copies of a complete Statement of Qualifications to the following address NOT LATER THAN 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 20, 2007:  Mr. James Mowery, Negotiator, FHWA Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S. W., Washington, D. C. 20590.   E-mailed, faxed, and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.   The REVISED estimate of the total value of this project is one million sixty-six thousand dollars.

<DESC>****Modification 2 is being issued to cancel NLM-06-053 in its entirety.****


It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole-source basis with Technical Resources International Inc. (TRI) under the authority of FAR 6.302 for
computerized information support services to maintain and enhance the Chemical  carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS).  The mission of the NLM Division of Specialized Information Services is to: (1) provide selected core toxicology and environmental health information resources and services; (2) facilitate access to national and international toxicology and environmental health information resources; and (3) strengthen the information infrastructure of toxicology and environmental health.  The CCRIS database is an integral component of NLMs mission to provide biomedical information.  As a primary user and disseminator of the CCRIS data, NLM wishes to transition the responsibility for CCRIS from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to NLM.  NLM will be unable to fulfill this component of its mission without continuation of the current highly efficient and effective computerized information services support.
		
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System) is an online database originally created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  In 1985, CCRIS was mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) system, and the database was maintained using TOXNET data input software.  The database contains data and results of research studies for over 9000 chemical compounds. The chemical - specific data fall into the selected areas of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition.  Full bibliographic references are also included in addition to specific indexing. 

The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the CCRIS database which resides, and may be searched, on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System. The input for this data base
comes from several sources such as:

- Surveillance and review of the published literature (e.g., CASelects)
- IARC Monographs
- NCI/NTP Toxicity and Bioassay Reports
- Applicable database searches

The Contractor shall survey these sources and evaluate pertinent data in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  At the direction of the Project Officer, the Contractor shall enter
suitable studies on chemicals into the CCRIS database.

The software for the maintenance and update of the CCRIS database on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System will be provided by the National Library of Medicine.

General process for CCRIS record building:

A Senior Scientist (Ph.D.) reviews published literature and results of database searches (typically abstracts) and selects potential studies.

An Information Specialist (B.S.) acquires copies of full reports/studies online (e.g., Docline) and at local libraries.  The citations, with a unique reference code, are also added to the reference file and retained for future use.
A Senior Scientist reviews the full reports/studies and determines if the report/study meets the established evaluation criteria.  If determined to be relevant and acceptable, the Senior Scientist codes the relevant data from the study onto standardized code sheets.

The code sheets and the full report/study are reviewed for scientific accuracy and completeness by an expert Peer Reviewer (Ph.D.).  Questions and issues are resolved with the Senior Scientist.

An Information Specialist enters the data from the code sheets into CCRIS using TOXNETs SSEUS data entry system.

A Staff Scientist (M.S.) double-checks (quality control/quality assurance) the data entered against the original code sheets.  Any questions or discrepancies are resolved with the Senior Scientist.  

The log of the periods activity is sent to and reviewed by the Project Manager.  When approved, the Project Manager notifies NLM staff that tifies NLM staff that the entered data is ready for public release.

Monthly reports are generated that reflect monthly activities and related costs.
				
TRI has provided expert information services support, through an NCI contract, to maintain and enhance the CCRIS database since its inception on the TOXNET system in 1985.  TRI has established a strong working relationship with NLM and uniquely understands the utilization of CCRIS data by the scientific community.  TRIs previous 21 years of experience with NCI and NLM have proven critical to the success of the CCRIS database.  This experience with NLM and NLMs SSEUS data entry system uniquely qualifies TRI as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  Therefore there will be no time lost with the usual learning curve or start-up processes.  It is determined that TRI is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints and a compelling need to avoid gaps in the maintenance and enhancement of CCRIS, TRIs continued service is considered a crucial component to the transition of the CCRIS database from NCI to NLM. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) business days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 06-053/RHW.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, NLM on (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   This amendment 5 to combined synopsis/RFQ-OH-07-00033 replaces the original and all amendments previous to this one. The combined sypnosis/request for quote (RFQ) is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with  additional information included in this notice.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business and the procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition  Procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures . A firm-fixed purchase order is anticipated as a result of this RFQ. The NAICS code is 541690, and the size standard is $6.5 million. The Clean Air Act requires the establishment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)  for the "criteria" air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and lead) and the periodic review of these  standards. One of the primary responsibilities of the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) is to prepare Science Assessments (SA) and Science Assessment Supporting Documents (SASDs) previously known as Air Quality Criteria Documents (AQCDs) for these criteria air pollutants.  The review of scientific literature is a fundamental  component for these activities.  The EPA is considering the development of a continuous process that will identify, compile, characterize and prioritize new scientific studies, which shall include the creation of an electronic database of information from the studies. Under this order, the EPA  seeks to assess the needs of potential users of the literature database and to develop options for database designs that meet these needs. An important factor in the creation of the database is that the database shall not be simply a method of linking a reference to a published abstract or paper.  Input to the database shall be accomplished by individuals knowledgeable in the various scientific disciplines contained in the SA/SASDs  and database references must be categorized into experiments relative to dose, exposure time, exposure model, endpoint and other parameters. Database queries  shall be retrievable in tabular format. Epidemiology analysis and other data references shall be categorized into usable information. ***Note: Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA  could not post the entire information to the fedbizopps website. If  a contractor is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via e-mail to Yvonne Harris at harris.yvonne@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments. The following clauses apply to this request for quote: FAR 52.212-1,  Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items and the specific evaluation criteria: (see Evaluation Criteria attachment) offerors shall provide information to demonstrate/substantiate that their quote meets the requirements in the Statement of Work; FAR  52.212-3, Offeror Representations & Certifications-Commercial Items, shall be completed by offeror  and submitted with quote, unless the offeror's registered with CCR; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms & Conditions-Commercial Items. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5,  Contract Terms & Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items will apply, 52.219-6, 52.222-3, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, and FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration; all clauses can  be found at  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFFARA.HTM In addition, US EPA EPAAR 1552.233-70, Notice of Filing Requirements for Agency Protest. Numbered Notes 1: The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. Offerors shall submit (1) one copy of their quotation that references  RFQ-OH-07-00033, no later than February 8, 2007 at 5:00 PM (EST) to Yvonne Harris at harris.yvonne@epa.gov or via fax at (513) 487-2107.

<DESC>MODIFICATION - Development of a Basic Order Agreement program for use by Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC)is no longer being pursued.  Thank you to those whom responded to the market survey.  

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY, A SOLICITATION WILL NOT FOLLOW THIS REQUEST

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the following districts:  Atlanta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida.  The DHS-FLETC is in process of determining the viability of issuance of Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) encompassing each district. The estimated time of performance will be a base year period of three (3) years, with two (2) one-year option periods.  BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the DHS-FLETC and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the DHS-FLETC and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the DHS-FLETC has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.   However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $2,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $500,000.00.  The Contracting Officer, will reserve the right to award subsequent task orders using one of the following methods:  Tradeoff (aka Best Value); Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA); or Price only.  When awarding using Tradeoff or LPTA, Contracting Officer may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to proceed with task order procurement on a sole source basis, or to compete an action among select BOA holders, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond and Performance and Payment Bond for each Task Order over $100,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by DHS-FLETC to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that DHS-FLETC solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.   DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work will involve a variety of trades, including, but not limited to, carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, interior and exterior electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, concrete masonry, welding and HVAC.   EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Emergency repairs include, but are not limited to, broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.  For emergency work requirements, firm must be able to respond within three (3) hours of notification to include proposal response, and if necessary subsequent work mobilization.    MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, interior and exterior painting, ceiling repairs or modifications.   DESIGN: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items.

The NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed in the NAICS Groups Sector 23, Construction.  GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick (Glynco), Georgia.   The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Government approval as well as a price proposal.   SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.   ORDERS:  Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form (OF) 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of various products developed by DoubleTake Software.  This software is required in order to provide real-time synchronization between SQL databases supporting the LCS product. This purchase includes a subscription service that includes software fixes, technical support, and new product updates. The SMART Office of the Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management requires the purchase of the new license with subscription maintenance listed above in Paragraph (1). These licenses and maintenance are required for the IRM/SMART development team to maintain tracking of all the additions and modifications to the requirements as we start the process of verifying them prior to starting formal development.  Currently the requirements are stored in an Excel spreadsheet.  This is not functional for requirement traceability and we need a tool design for this purpose.  This approval is not to be confused with standardization of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4).    Therefore, these requirements preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company.   IRM/SMART requires the purchase of this new software, licenses and support as stated above.  The Governments estimated value of this requirement is $31,616.00.  This is an initial license to get IRM/SMART started with the task of requirement verification.  An additional number of licenses will be required once the SMART project obtain full funding as other members of the SMART project will also need access to the requirements for review, clarification, etc. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  These DoubleTake Software licenses and software are essential for meeting the Departments need to provide a failover and recovery sequence for the LCS SQL servers within the SMART project<BR><BR>

This is a build-to-print effort.  There is a data package for the Oil Pressure Indicator configuration planned for procurement.  In addition to the drawings, there are also specifications that define parameters of testing, design, and other various aspects of the Oil Pressure Indicator.  The contractor will be required to use approved vendors identified on all source control drawings.  A new Oil Pressure Indicator producer will be required to successfully complete first article (pre-production) testing before production go-ahead. Two Oil Pressure Indicators will be required for first article approval testing.   First article testing will be conducted on specific sub-assemblies and the first initial production units.  Most testing will be conducted at the contractor facility to ensure that the contractor develops the capability to verify product performance during production.  Some system level testing will be conducted at government facilities.  Data drawing is attached as a reference.  Drawing may be viewed with Lucent Viewer.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide a wide range of technical and support services required for the proper care, use and humane treatment of laboratory animals to any NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) animal program.  Functions include: veterinary medicine, animal care and husbandry, veterinary and research technical support, data management, cage and environment sanitation, routine maintenance of animal care equipment, animal transportation, logistical and clerical support. Support is to be provided to projects involving the full range of biomedical research and scientific disciplines.

Continuous high quality animal care shall be provided as set forth in the applicable animal welfare regulations, standards and guidelines. Animals must be maintained under carefully controlled conditions to minimize research variables and allow the accurate interpretation of laboratory results. It is essential that animal colonies be properly maintained to avoid any situation or condition such as undue stress, diseases, animal identification problems, escapes, etc., that might adversely affect ongoing research.

NIH laboratory animal programs involve the use of approximately 575,000 square feet of space located primarily in twenty-six buildings on the Bethesda campus and thirteen buildings at the Animal Center in Poolesville, MD. Remote facilities include four leased facilities in Rockville and Gaithersburg and two Government-owned facilities in Baltimore, MD.  All NIH animal programs and facilities comply with applicable laboratory animal regulations, guidelines and standards, and are accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor(s) shall furnish all necessary qualified personnel to perform technical and support services required for the proper care, use and humane treatment of laboratory animals.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME, this request for information does not constitute a request for proposal and submission of any information based on this synopsis is purely voluntary.

If your organization is a small business and has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, web site address, and telephone number. 2) Size and type of ownership for the organization, [i.e., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) firm, etc.]. 3) A tailored capability statement  addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability.  Business concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above.  Business concerns demonstrating the capability to accomplish the requirements shall supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.

Following are the system requirements:  1) The ability to quickly search, monitor and perform direction finding (DF) on the entire VHF/UHF spectrum using a wideband receiver and four digital narrowband handoff receivers with the data sent back to operator work stations located at EPIC and San Antonio, Texas.  The link between the remote site and the operator work stations will be made by fractional T1 or high speed internet connection.  The link between the remote site and the operator work stations including associated hardware (router, modem, etc.) will be provided by EPIC.  2) The ability to perform AM, Log AM, FM, CW, LSB, USB, ISB and Phase Modulation detection.  3) The system shall be have a minimum of 20 MHz instantaneous bandwidth in DF mode, system DF accuracy of at least two degrees RMS, a built in calibration system to maintain DF accuracy, minimum of 24 hours of digitized voice and DF information recording with date/time tagging, frequency, signal parameters, line of bearing or fix (when additional linked sites are added in the future).  4)  Full control of the remote wideband and digital narrowband receivers from the operator work stations.  5) The capability for future expansion to include additional remote sites and operator work stations linked to the original system to obtain fixes.  6) Multiple, simultaneous, full access to a single remote site by different operator work stations.  Each operator must be able to access all the wideband data from the remote wideband receiver and simultaneously demodulate signals of interest using multiple digital narrowband handoff receivers.  7) When a signal of interest is detected on the wideband receiver, the operator must be able to listen to and record that signal using a handoff receiver while continuing to search the remainder of the spectrum, using the wideband receiver, for additional signals of interest.  8) The data from the wideband system must be displayed on a graphic user interface (GUI) in such a manner as to enable the operator to readily identify new signals, demodulate the signal and view signal information.  9) The ability to deselect frequencies and/or frequency ranges known to be of no interest so they are no longer displayed on the wideband GUI.  10) The ability to prioritize frequencies of interest so that priority display of signal information to the operator and assignment of that signal to a narrowband handoff receiver for demodulation is automatically performed.  11) The ability to quickly and automatically detect, with a minimum of false hits, perform DF and store DF information on all detectable signals for later analysis.  12) Automatic display of priority signal location on a mapping system.  13) The ability for the operator to define particular signal attributes, such as geographic location of the signal emitter, so that signals matching these attributes will automatically display signal information based on operator selected priorities.  14) The ability to enter frequency tables for scanning.  15) Voice detection with automatic and manual recording.  16) The ability to manually fine tune the handoff receivers.  17) Digital recording, at the operator work station, of selected signals in standard audio file formats.  18) Listen to demodulated signals in real-time while recording the signal.  19) The ability to readily locate and play back an entire recording or a selected part of a recording repeatedly for transcription.  20) The ability to select the DF information to use for a fix in order to refine the accuracy of the fix (for use when additional systems are installed to obtain fixes on targets).  21) Display the DF information on a mapping system along with signal information.  22) The ability for the handoff receivers to solve voice inversion.  23) The ability to solve frequency hopping, trunking and PL tones.  24) Installation of all contractor provided equipment shall be done in such a manner as to minimize potential damage due to lightning strikes.  The Contractor shall be held responsible for providing, delivering, installing and testing one wideband radio receiver system.  The Contractor shall be held responsible for providing all parts, materials, labor and transportation related to the provision, delivery, installation, and testing of the system.  Small businesses that are capable and interested shall submit their capabilities statement directly via e-mail to:  Richard.R.Marro@usdoj.gov or by mail to:  The Drug Enforcement Administration, El Paso Intelligence Center, Attn: Richard R. Marro, 11339 SSG Sims Street, El Paso, TX  79908 no later than February 16, 2007.

THIS NOTICE DOES NOT COMMIT THE DEA TO PROCURE THE SUBJECT SUPPLIES/SERVICES NOR INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.   However, the Government may subsequently issue a Request for Proposal which could lead to a Fixed-price ID/IQ contract with base year plus four successive option years.  The Government is seeking information only to determine whether small businesses are interested and are capable of providing this type of supplies/services.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to identify potential offerors for consulting services for Resource Efficiency Management (REM) Services to support Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawaii (NAVFACHI) in managing and reducing energy consumption and demand at NAVFACHI, Oahu, Hawaii by means of a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract.  The work includes, but is not limited to the following:
Identify and help correct anomalies in facility energy and water use.  Use existing information management systems, spreadsheets, meter and billing databases, and expertise to identify and help correct anomalies in facility energy and water use.  Use NAVFAC HI's CUBIC, MVWeb?, SCADA and other information management systems to identify apparent energy and water consumption anomalies in NAVFAC HI customer facilities.  Anomalies may include unexplained electric consumption spikes, deviations from recent and last year's consumption patterns, unusual load curves, unusually high energy use per square foot and similar indicators.  Work with Navy-identified Building First Lieutenants (BFLs), Navy-assigned Building Energy Monitors (BEM), and NAVFAC HI/Navy Region Hawaii personnel to field check and diagnose such problems.  In many cases, the Contractor may be able to correct the problem at no cost or, as authorized, with low-cost measures such as replacing a bad photocell.  Refer more complex problems and recommended corrective actions to the Energy Manager for correction.  In all cases, provide an economic analysis to help justify the work.  Build, train and maintain an effective network of Building Energy Monitors (BEM) in NRH facilities.   Provide initial and annual BEM training, maintain communications, provide feedback on building energy performance through MVWeb and other information management systems, alert them to any anomalies noted, and provide appropriate recognition and other incentives to help sustain their active participation.  Training and Participation in Conferences/Workshops/Seminars as necessary to perform the work shall be at no additional cost to the Government.  Analyze and provide recommendations to optimize facility operations to minimize utility consumption.  Identify and update a list of facilities with greatest potential for energy cost savings based on annual utility consumption.  Subject to the Energy Program Leadership, work with NAVFAC HI to determine how those buildings are operated and recommend ways to operate more efficiently.  Recommendations may include controls on building systems, Operations and Maintenance (O&M) measures such as turning off equipment and lights in vacant areas, replacing inefficient equipment, commissioning/ recommissioning/constant commissioning existing equipment, incorporation of new equipment to improve performance of existing equipment, etc.  The Contractor will support activities for the Navy?s Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Program, including bench- and pilot-scale demonstrations of energy efficiency and resource conservation technologies and management solutions to help NAVFAC HI determine how these measures help facilities operate more efficiently.  Prepare technology evaluation reports and other technology transfer materials in support of the RDT&E Program.  Recommendations that are beyond the ability of the activity to implement shall be referred to the appropriate office, with economic analysis, for a possible project.  Support and enhance the NAVFAC HI energy awareness program.  Plan and carry out continual energy awareness activities (including Energy Awareness Week); provide awareness briefings to Public Works Officers (PWOs), Building First Lieutenants (BFLs), staff meetings and others; develop and sustain meaningful awards and other incentive programs.  Support Utility Demand Reduction (UDR) program to maximize cost avoidance.  Identify and develop energy management initiatives, O&M measures and projects to enhance the effectiveness of the UDR program.  Measures may include building a comprehensive and current UDR call list; identifying loads that can be controlled during load sheds, and working out agreements with the facilities to do so; making broadcast e-mail and Audix load-shed announcements; training BFLs how to respond to load-shed calls; and recommending other ways to reduce demands.  Identify potential energy projects, programs and initiatives.  In the course of carrying out its tasks under this contract, the Contractor may find energy conservation opportunities beyond the scope of the contract.

The M156 includes a M27 Transmitter,M39 Receiver, M6 Battery retainer, Transmitter and Receiver Antennas and ancillary items.  The M156 must provide command, control and communication capabilities for firing ordnance and controlling other types of equipment through water, sand, earth, rock, man- made and natural structures. The receiver must also be small, lightweight and  fit in the breast pocket of the current Battle Dress Uniform (BDU).   Key specifications for the MI-RAMS are as follows: MI-RAMS Transmitter: a. Will have a low battery/ready to transmit indicator. b. The stand-alone MI-RAMS Transmitter shall have a nominal range of 150  meters through water, sand, earth, rock, manmade, and natural structures.   When using the auxiliary powersource, the transmitter shall have a nominal  range of 200 meters through the same media. c. Will have the capability of simultaneously firing any number of MI-RAMS  Receivers within range or sequential firing of at least four groups of  receivers. d. Each MI RAMS Transmitter will have seven factory-set transmission codes  that are unique to that transmitter.  These seven unique codes will be field programmable via a link from the transmitter to the receivers. e. The power sources shall provide sufficient power for a minimum of 40  transmissions (goal of 60) at ambient.  Ambient is defined as 77 Â±18 degrees  Fahrenheit, relative humidity 20-80 percent. f. Will be compatible with present night vision goggles. g. Will have an interface to provide the capability of being functioned by the  MI-RAMS type"Aâ Receiver and the M152 RAMS Type âAâ Receiver (M16) or a  device with similar output which will provide a relay capability. h. If required to conserve battery power, a separate signal may be sent from  the MI-RAMS Transmitter first to pre-alert both MI RAMS Receivers to allow  them to accept the non delay command function signal. i. Should include a self-test function that checks the integrity of the  transmitter, indicating to the operator via a light emitting diode (LED) flashing pattern that the transmitter is ready to operate. MI-RAMS Auxiliary Power Source: a.Will attach directly to the MI-RAMS Transmitter. b.Will require no external power cables.   MI-RAMS Type A Receiver: a.Will provide an electrical output capable of detonating up to four electric blasting caps (M-6) at a 100 ft. range from the receiver utilizing WD-1 field wire. b. Will be able to function (turn on/off) equipment (such as beacons, laser  markers, and ground marking lights) through its power output. c.Will be able to function an MI-RAMS Transmitter and an M152 Remote Activation Munition  System (RAMS) Transmitter (M26) in a relay or âdaisy-chainâ configuration  through an external relay cable. d.Shall have the capability of being programmed to the seven unique transmission codes of  any MI RAMS Transmitter and only function by those unique transmission codes  or until reset.   Will retain these codes when turned off.  The programmed unique transmission codes will be held in memory for a minimum of 30 days (goal of 60 days). e.Will indicate to the user that it has been successfully programmed via the use of an LED.Will utilize the same LED indicator as the one used in the M152 System's M16 Receiver in an effort to obtain the same green brightness  indication for the user to view.  The LED will be mounted in the case similar to M152 System's M16 Receiver to afford the same field of view to  the user. f.Will measure near-field MI noise levels and actively indicate to the user whether it is in an area of acceptable noise via the use of an LED.  When a "noise test" function is selected prior to arming, the LED will indicate a go/no-go noise condition, i.e., solid in an acceptable noise environment and blinking in an unacceptable noise environment.  This go/no-go noise test function will serveas an active sensor, requiring no additional inputs as the  user moves around a location in search of acceptable noise environment. g.Will be compatible with present night vision goggles. h.Will be safe to use when attached to power line towers, electric generators,  or other emitters. i.Following programming, the Type A Receiverâs command actuation code should  be validated by usinga test mode on the transmitter and receiver.

<SUBJECT>R -- Measures of Travel Time in Freight Significant Corridors and Measures of Delay and Crossing Time for U.S. International Land Border Crossings
<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a SOLE-SOURCE contract.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award one and only one contract, on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, to the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), which is located at 2200 Mill Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22314.  It is anticipated that the SOLE-SOURCE award to ATRI will be in the form of a cost-reimbursable contract.  It is estimated that ATRI?s resulting SOLE-SOURCE contract will have a two-year Period of Performance.  Under ATRI?s SOLE-SOURCE contract, ATRI will establish and maintain a freight performance measurement (FPM) research program focused on measuring speed and travel time reliability on freight significant corridors and measuring crossing and delay time at major US international land border crossings.  The data resulting from the FPM program will be used to identify areas of significant freight congestion and bottlenecks.  Another primary use of the data will be to monitor progress in the U. S. Department of Transportation?s (DOT?s) and Federal Highway Administration?s (FHWA?s) strategic objective of global connectivity.  Key objectives of this work are to:  (a) develop and / or refine methods of collecting data on freight travel (congestion); (b) develop tools for analyzing and processing data; (c) derive measures for congestion and reliability; (d) develop data products and tools that will assist DOT, FHWA, and state and local transportation agencies in addressing surface transportation congestion; and (e) develop a rich freight data source that can be used to inform the development of strategies and tactics for managing and relieving freight congestion.  Key facets of the FPM program shall include:  (1) routine reporting of results to support FHWA?s performance measurement and reporting; (2) development of tools and data products that will assist DOT, FHWA, State Departments of Transportation, and other public transportation agencies in managing congestion and bottlenecks in the freight transportation system; (3) development of data products and tools that add value to the freight planning process and freight modeling; (4) analysis of freight travel time data as it relates to delay caused by nonrecurring congestion, with an emphasis on construction / work zones, crashes, breakdowns, extreme weather conditions, and special events; (5) targeted outreach to enhance the public transportation agencies? and private sector organizations? knowledge and understanding of the importance of FPM data (freight-specific, intercity data on travel time); (6) development of a freight travel time database that can be used to guide investment decision at the state and local level and be used by FHWA and DOT to guide national policy and legislation related to freight management; and (7) engagement with state, regional and local transportation agencies and universities conducting transportation research on behalf of transportation agencies in specific projects and case studies that use FPM data.  For the following reasons among others, ATRI alone is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform this SOLE-SOURCE contract.  Through past / related research, ATRI has demonstrated a unique and innovative concept to provide the required services related to collecting proprietary truck travel time data.  ATRI through its unique relationship with the motor carrier industry is able to collect truck travel time data that is regarded as proprietary in nature.  The proprietary data needed for the contemplated FPM effort is deemed to be available only from the original source (technology vendor) used in previous research, and the contemplated FPM effort is a logical follow-on to the previous work.  ATRI is the only transportation research agency that is directly affiliated with the American Trucking Association (ATA).  ATRI?s relationship / affiliation with ATA uniquely positions ATRI to have access to over 35,000 motor carriers through the affiliated trucking associations in 50 states and to foster collaboration and cooperation with the trucking industry----all of which is indispensable to the success of the contemplated FPM effort.   Through this relationship with industry ATRI is able to gain access to proprietary satellite location data and derive non-proprietary data and information on travel speed and travel time reliability.  The ATRI research team processes the proprietary data into non-proprietary data and information that FHWA uses for monitoring performance in one of its strategic goals and to inform decisions on better managing congestion on the surface transportation system.  Employing a new data collection methodology and new source of data would result in issues with accuracy and comparability of data.  Key to being able to meet the agency?s data requirement in a timely manner is the establishment of a long-term contract to facilitate the continuous acquisition of the proprietary data and processing of the data into a non-proprietary format.  Through previous efforts the ATRI research team has demonstrated a unique capability to gain access to proprietary data from commercial trucking firms and to use it to measure travel rates and travel time on freight significant highways in the United States.  The initial research ATRI completed for the FHWA involved the production of a major data management system consisting of highly specialized processing software.  Because of the highly specialized software developed for processing and managing data, and because of the nature of the data (proprietary data that belongs to the freight industry), and because of the unique relationship ATRI has with the trucking industry, and because of the FHWA?s requirement for no lapse in data collection-----ATRI is considered to be the only organization that is capable of performing the contemplated FPM effort.  If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned overwhelming factual basis logically favoring ATRI as the only organization capable of satisfactorily executing the contract envisioned herein, any organization OTHER THAN ATRI believes that it can perform this project, then any such other organization shall submit one HARD-paper original and 10 HARD-paper copies of a complete Statement of Qualifications to the following address NOT LATER THAN 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 20, 2007:  Mr. James Mowery, Negotiator, FHWA Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S. W., Washington, D. C. 20590.   E-mailed, faxed, and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.   It is estimated that the total value of this project will be one million fifty-eight thousand dollars.

?Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number? means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 
?Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number? means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. 
?Registered in the CCR database? means that? 
(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 
(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 
(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 
(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation ?DUNS? or ?DUNS +4? followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror?s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 
(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 
(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number? 
(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or 
(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 
(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 
(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). 
(v) Company Telephone Number. 
(vi) Date the company was started. 
(vii) Number of employees at your location. 
(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. 
(ix) Line of business (industry). 
(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 
(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 
(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 
(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(g) 
(1) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<SUBJECT>J -- Maintenance Agreement
<DESC>The Bureau of ATF intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pitney Bowes, Annandale, VA to procure maintenance agreement for one year of ATF owned mailing systems.   Pitney Bowes has developed proprietary mailing systems, such as DM infinity, B700 series, DM 300 series, and DM 500 series, and 1000 which ATF owns and no other company can service their mailing systems.  By having this equipment under Pitney maintenance agreement ATF will have the assurance of always having operable equipment, at any given time and/or in emergency situations.  Pitney Bowes is the only company capable of servicing the Bureau?s mailing equipment.  Bureau has 227 locations with ATF owned equipment.  Failure to have maintenance agreement would be detrimental to the Bureau?s mission due to the fact that ATF will not be able to repair broken equipment and will not be able to mail mission related items.  This would also result in serious financial burdens by requiring the purchase of new mailing equipment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. There is no solicitation available for this requirement. This requirement will be awarded through the Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. The closing date for this requirement is February 2, 2007, 2:00pm EST. Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Paula King, Contracting Officer, by e-mail Paula.King@atf.gov or fax 202-927-8688.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 with a small business standard of $6.5 million.  


The period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2008 with one option year from September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility).


Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  Such collaborations will yield new conceptual frameworks, methods, measures, and technologies that will speed the improvement of population health.

Scope of Work:

Despite the growing enthusiasm for interdisciplinary approaches and recent models of success, broad acceptance of interdisciplinary research remains a goal for the future.  In consultation with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff, the Contractor shall develop programs and initiatives to facilitate an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to population health research by fostering collaborations among the broad base of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, employers, practitioners, patients, and the general public) needed to ensure the implementation and adoption of scientific findings.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving interdisciplinary research. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following seven key OBSSR goals:

1.	Engage the scientific community through a variety of modalities such as symposia, working groups, and ad hoc committees to identify research areas that can be effectively investigated using interdisciplinary approaches.

2.	Encourage and support the identification of and the development of funding opportunity announcements and Requests for Proposals to address the areas identified for interdisciplinary study.

3.	Provide education and training activities to facilitate interdisciplinary research among biomedical, behavioral, and social science researchers and practitioners.  Strive for appropriate representation of scientific disciplines across the natural sciences (e.g., psychology, biology), mathematics and computer science, social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, communications, political science, public health), and applied sciences beyond traditional health-related fields (e.g., business, education, engineering).

4.	Identify, document, and share with key audiences studies that demonstrate the value of integrating social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

5.	Develop metrics and methods needed to demonstrate the economic benefits and public health impacts of rigorous, integrated biopsychosocial health research.

6.	Collaborate in the development of curricula, modules, and materials to train behavioral, social, and biomedical scientists to design and conduct interdisciplinary research.

7.	Strengthen the behavioral and social sciences research methods and analyses to support interdisciplinary biopsychosocial health research.  Increase the degree to which behavioral and social scientists have the capacity to help fulfill the Office?s mandate and the NIH mission.

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much? 
?	Realistic ? Does OBSSR have the resources to achieve the objective?
?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Convene a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider and refine the seven goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan based on the prioritized and refined goals with specific objectives and performance indicators of progress and success
3)	Prepare the draft strategic implementation plan for the refined goals.
4)	Circulate the draft plan to stakeholders and NIH Behavioral and Social Sciences Coordinating Committee for review and comments
5)	Revise the plan based on the comments received
6)	Finalize the plan for publication

The Contractor shall assist in developing an evaluation plan and indicators for the implementation of the strategic priorities and specific objectives.  The Assessment Plan is critical to the ongoing progress and success of the Office?s efforts.  The Contractor shall develop indicators of progress and success.  The contractor shall ensure that ongoing progress assessments will be easy to conduct and supportive of the Office?s efforts. The assessment approach will yield simple reports of progress over time, and indicate where success is indicated.  The progress assessment will serve not only to enable the internal OBSSR group to track progress, but also will point to communications opportunities with Institutes and Centers, external research and program partners, and other key supporters.  

Technical Evaluation Criteria:

In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the
Government?s needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:

OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop research programs and initiatives in dissemination science and communications.
 
Scope of Work:

In today?s digitally connected environment, an infrastructure for better communications and dissemination represents a key part of OBSSR?s communications strategy.  Improving the nation?s health requires knowledge of behavior change and interactive technologies (e.g., e-health, internet-based interactive technology to change behavior).  Communications is a multi-directional process that links communities of research and practice.  Public health interventions cannot save lives if they are not implemented, and research cannot improve health if it is not informed by the needs and experiences of practitioners.  Building communication channels that link all of the stakeholders of public health into a living, participatory community will form a critical backbone for the way we approach health, disease, and wellness in the future.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving the science of dissemination and communication strategies and goals. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following three key OBSSR strategic goals:

1.	Identifying what is known and where the gaps are in the general public?s understanding of evidence-based behavior, change tools and technology, especially e-health and interactive web, telephone and other electronic media.  

2.	Identifying or creating dissemination channels for sharing social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

3.	Working with other expert consultants, coordinate a workgroup to identify social marketing strategies, understanding of consumer demand and direct to consumer advertising approaches to educating the public about behavioral science tools.  .  

4.	Identifying key audiences and tailoring strategic communications strategies to those audiences to increase awareness of behavioral tools.

5.	Developing a method to gather and identify the best evidence-based practices and policies for behavior change.

6.	Developing plans to improve the health literacy of the public and their ability to identify and use evidence-based behavior change tools.

Further, for each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much? 
?	Realistic ? Does OBSSR have the resources to achieve the objective?
?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Convene a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider the six goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan to refine the goals with specific objectives and performance indicators of progress and success
3)	Prepare the draft strategic implementation plan for the refined goals listed above
4)	Circulate the draft plan to stakeholders and NIH Behavioral and Social Sciences Coordinating Committee for review and comments
5)	Revise the plan based on the comments received
6)	Finalize the plan for publication

The Contractor shall assist in developing an evaluation plan and indicators for the implementation of the strategic priorities and specific objectives.  The Assessment Plan is critical to the ongoing progress and success of the Office?s efforts.  The Contractor shall develop indicators of progress and success.  The contractor shall ensure that ongoing progress assessments will be easy to conduct and supportive of the Office?s efforts. The assessment approach will yield simple reports of progress over time, and indicate where success is indicated.  The progress assessment will serve not only to enable the internal OBSSR group to track progress, but also will point to communications opportunities with Institutes and Centers, external research and program partners, and other key supporters.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

BACKGROUND: The Aberdeen Area IHS has a requirement for digital medical imaging as this is more accurate than traditional film-screen methods. Digital medical imaging also represents the current standard of care for the treatment of patients. Additionally, radiology examinations must be read by a radiologist currently requiring the films to be couriered to the Radiologist and the reports returned to the facility. This significantly delays treatment. With the images being digital they can be transmitted electronically to the Radiologist for interpretation.

SCOPE OF WORK: Contractor shall acquire and assemble all required products. System shall be integrated with the IHS Information Technology network and the IHS RPMS RIS system. When installed, the system shall be tested to ensure proper functionality. At installation and after testing is successful, 3 Sisseton Service Unit personnel shall be trained in the use and functions of the system. Training may run up to 8 hours. Contractor shall provide one year full service warranty which shall include travel, parts, labor and 24/7 unlimited telephone, e-mail and remote support with 1 hour call back guaranteed and 24 hours on-site. Delivery to be coordinated with the Project Officer to ensure that other systems to which this system interacts are running and prepared for the integration. The system shall be full integrated and functional as a complete PACS/CR system prior to acceptance by the Government.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Date of Award (projected start date is February 14) through May 13, 2006 for installation, testing, and training.

COMPUTER SECURITY: All Federal agencies are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). Within HHS, there is a requirement for this training to be completed annually by all employees including all contractors, volunteers, students, summer externs, etc.

CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer.

SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government.  Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge.

The FAR citation implementing this authority is Part 6.302-1 (b) (2) Only One Responsible Source.  Reason for Authority Cited:  This authority is cited du e to Smith & Nephew being the only manufacturer, seller, and distributor of its orthopedic surgical implants.  The Food and Drug Administration requires FDA approval for all medical products used invasively. These products are intended for United States ci tizens abroad.  FDA approval is also required for use on troop population. Failure to establish this contract will seriously harm the Government in that it will jeopardize the Army Medical Departments (AMEDD) ability to surgically care for its patients. This specific procurement is for Smith & Nephew brand parts only.  Smith & Nephew is one of several orthopedic implant manufacturers that provide orthopedic implants.  However, the use of a specific manufacturers product is a physician decision based upon  the patients medical diagnosis and prognosis, product and clinical efficacy, and the surgeons expertise using a specific product.  Each of the available manufacturers products are not compatible with other manufacturers products. Gilbert W. Hovermale Contracting Officer Approved for release

Acceptance will be at the destination.  FOB point is destination.   In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable,  the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability. This meth od will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote determined. In order to be considered the lowest priced technically acceptable offer, quoters must provide pricing for all items and be able to deliver by the time frame specified. The items being quoted shall be DECRU® products and the part numbers specified. The justification for brand name is as follows: This brand/device is intended as a backup to an existing DECRU® encryption-at-rest device on our virtual server stack.  The existing DECRU® Datafort is not compatible with any other encryption-at-rest device.   Therefore the requested DECRU® Datafort is the only device capable of fulfilling the requirement of an in-system, online backup. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using a SF 1449.  A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offe rors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111- 4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4133, Commercial Vehicle Access to Ft. Lewis, and  52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to  this acquisition.   Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and the D Street Gate when those gates are operational.  The Logistics Center Gate is open for commercial vehicle traffic from 0530-2130 hours Monday  Friday.  The gate is closed all weekends and federal holidays The D Stre et Gate is open for commercial vehicle traffic from 0530-1330 Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates are open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection.   In the event both the Logistics Center Gate and the D Street Gate  are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Madigan Gate (Exit 122 from I-5). Madigan Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday.   All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The  Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.   If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does  not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 in clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis  must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, incl uding drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane without being routinely subjected to a vehicle inspection, except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delt a.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or the D Street Gate.  If both of those gates are closed then the commercial vehicles will use the Madigan Gate.  All passengers in the  contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicl e must enter through the Logistics Center Gate, D Street Gate, or the Madigan Gate, as appropriate per the hours in (a) above and obtain visitor passes.      Fast Access gate lanes are available at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, and the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate.  Fast Access lanes are planned  for the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.     (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Madigan Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the C ontracting Officer.     Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not pa rticipate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.   b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contra ctor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the con tractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the insta llation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor em ployee.      c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change .  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability  to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location  at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their emplo yees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, fol lowed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identificati on badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.   f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4 (i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for a ccess to the installation.   Local clause 52.111-4133 states: Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  The following procedures apply if the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated or expires.

All commercial vehicles will be searched.  A visitor pass must be obtained.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their d estination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does  not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 in clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.

The Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management intends to award a contract for Tri-interface Java cards. This award will enable HHS to procure Personal Identification Verification (PIV)-compliant smart cards in accordance with (IAW) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).   The award is for one year with four option years.  HHS will make an initial purchase of 75,000 smart cards in the base year and will have the option to purchase up to 225,000 additional smart cards in the option years: a total ceiling of 300,000 smart cards.  These smart cards will be designed to meet the objectives of HSPD-12 and the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1.  FIPS 201-1 defines the overall technical requirements and the foundation of the common identification standard of the PIV smart card. The ?tri-interface? PIV-compliant smart card is the only PIV-compliant smart card on the market today that meets the FIPS 201-1 PIV standard and the Department?s specific interoperability requirement for physical access and provides the capability to meet the future, mandatory 2048-bit encryption key handling and the functionality of JAVA containers for Global PIN Single Sign On (SSO) applets for logical access.  The HHS logical access control requirement calls for a Global PIN Single Sign On (SSO) applet only available with the Oberthur smart card. The smart cards must have passed the National Institutes of Technology (NIST) PIV certification and the offeror must be on the General Services Administration (GSA) approved HSPD-12 vendor list.
