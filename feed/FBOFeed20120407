<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast (NAVFAC-SE) intends to award a sole source contract to Peoples Gas (TECO) under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost –effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facility alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy saving devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation. This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC). For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.
The proposed procurement is for the design and installation of an Energy Management Control System as outlined in a no-cost Energy Conservation Project Proposal.
  This project provides for HVAC control installation/upgrades in 56 buildings aboard Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, FL. The scope of work includes expanding existing Teletrol DDC systems or replacing existing out-dated control systems (pneumatic or electric) with BACNet compatible devices beyond what is included in any ongoing projects.  New DDC points will be identified during design to be provided within existing buildings that already have incorporated DDC controls.  This scope also includes installing new DDC systems in buildings that do not currently have them.  Energy efficient strategies will be incorporated into DDC programming. All buildings will communicate via existing fiber optic network or wireless back to a central work station located at the PWD.
 The central work station will have the ability to monitor, control, and change DDC set points. The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include but are not limited to the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase. This project will be fully funded; therefore, financing provisions under the UESC will not be applicable.
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration. The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.
 Responses to this posting must be submitted to susan.caldwell@navy.mil in PDF format no later than March 28, 2012. Point of Contact: Susan Caldwell, Contracting Officer, Phone (904) 270-3203.
