<DESC>FA8620-05-G-3028 0051, Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) Integration and Testing. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis for the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Predator Systems Group. The objective for this project is to fully integrate an ASIP-2C payload and associated antenna array into the MQ-9 system and successfully complete end-to-end material and non-material system testing of the sensor. The project will encompass modifying at least one MQ-9 and four associated Ground Control Stations (GCS) to enable onboard integration and testing of the ASIP-2C sensor package. The Government seeks to design and build aircraft/GCS installation kits, modify the appropriate mechanical and electrical systems in designated test aircraft and GCSs, develop required software modifications, design and build required support equipment and create System Integration Laboratory (SIL), ground and flight test plans and procedures. Additionally, the Government shall install and test ASIP-2C in the MQ-9 SIL, then complete MQ-9 system ground tests, airworthiness certification, ASIP-2C sensor calibration flights, system developmental flight tests and ASIP-2C end-to-end system testing onboard the MQ-9. The project will include generation of technical data and training material related to integration of ASIP-2C into MQ-9 operations.
<p>General Atomics is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the Predator and Reaper systems, and is the only firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data required to perform this effort. The government does not own the data rights for the system; therefore, to avoid duplication costs, the government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c )(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>

<DESC>C2IS and C2AOS are companion programs intended to develop, field, and sustain modular net-centric Command and Control (C2) applications and data management solutions for current and future C2 systems that are not planned or delivered by systems of record (SoR).  As such, C2IS and C2AOS will address many of the functional requirements that are currently met by the operationally-fielded Theater Battle Management Core System-Force Level (TBMCS-FL).  C2IS and C2AOS will deliver software capabilities intended to execute on an "externally-provided" infrastructure such as the Air Force's Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (WS), AN/USQ 163, or the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES).  C2IS and C2AOS alone and/or together do not yield "systems" but rather contribute distinct capabilities and functionality to "host systems" that are managed or provided by other programs.
NOTE: Please disregard previous information posted on the Command and Control Air Operation Suite page.  For updated information on C2IS/C2AOS please refer to this page.

<DESC>THIS CONTRACTING ACTION IS BEING OFFERED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND RE-INVESTMENT ACT (ARRA).

The Forest Service has a requirement for crushing and stockpiling gravel from the Big Creek gravel pit.  The source of the material to be crushed is a Government-owned pit on the National Forest System land.  This pit has been used before to produce crushed aggregate for road surfacing.  The Quality control of all work performed to provide the end product is the Offeror's responsibility.  The Government will inspect the work periodically to ensure quality is being met.

Project Location:  The Big Creek Gravel Pit is located on the Superior Ranger District, Lolo National Forest, Mineral County, Montana, on the Big Creek Road No.386, Forest Road No. 18654.  

No pre-quote Site Visit is scheduled, however, Offerors are encouraged to visit the site and review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision #52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (Apr 1984).  Failure of the Offeror to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the Offeror from the resposibility for successfully performing the work without addtional expense to the Government. Any questions regarding the project may be directed to Nate Kegel, at (406) 822-3927.

The project cost estimate is $250,000 - $500,000.  All work must be completed by 01 September 2011.

All responsible Offerors may submit a quote which will be considered by the Government, IAW FAR 4.1102(a), and prospective must be registered in CCR.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate with Mr. Matthew Bakalar to assist in the engineering development of at least two additional projects with the Signal Processing and Instrumentation Section (SPIS): fluorescence photo activation localization microscopy (FPALM) analysis system and an image-based robotic targeting system to control micromanipulators for living biological tissues studies.
.
Background Information:
 NIH is a federation of Institutes and Centers (ICs), each with a congressionally mandated program of categorical biomedical research. NIH conducts its research activities through the combined mechanisms of an extramural program (research grants), a collaborative program (research contracts), and an intramural program that is an aggregate, on-campus program involving both clinical and laboratory-based research.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

The NHLBI stimulates basic discoveries about the causes of disease, enables the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice, fosters training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians, and communicates research advances to the public. It creates and supports a robust, collaborative research infrastructure in partnership with private and public organizations, including academic institutions, industry, and other government agencies. The Institute collaborates with patients, families, health care professionals, scientists, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, community organizations, and the media to promote the application of research results and leverage resources to address public health needs. The NHLBI also collaborates with international organizations to help reduce the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide.

Purpose and Objectives:
The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, Systems Biology Center, Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, will design graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated image processing implementations and real-time motion tracking and robotic control algorithm (e.g. 3D volume, control feedback) developments, primarily to further advance the highly specialized TPEFM research methodology.  Integration of many disparate software and hardware modules is essential, and requires advanced knowledge in C/C++, the nVidia CUDA The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, Systems Biology Center, Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, will design graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated image processing implementations and real-time motion tracking and robotic control algorithm (e.g. 3D volume, control feedback) developments, primarily to further advance the highly specialized TPEFM research methodology.  Integration of many disparate software and hardware modules is essential, and requires advanced knowledge in C/C++, the nVidia CUDA

Required Specifications:
In vivo microscopy seeks to observe dynamic subcellular processes in a physiologically relevant context. A primary limitation of optical microscopy in vivo is tissue motion, which prevents physiological time course observations or image averaging.  The objective is to develop and demonstrate motion compensation methods that can automatically track image planes within biological tissues, including the tissue displacements associated with large changes in blood flow, and to evaluate the effect of global hypoxia on the regional kinetics and steady state levels of mitochondrial NAD(P)H.  To this end, Mr. Bakalar will attempt to increase the robustness of tracking algorithms and the maximum possible tracking frequency.  

Contractor Requirements:
The Contractor shall assist in the engineering development and integration of tissue motion tracking capabilities into a one-of-a-kind two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (TPEFM) research system at the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP). The high priority project requires the design and implementation of new methods that allow for the imaging of moving structures (e.g. living tissues) by compensation for motion as a function of time. An example IRP research application is the in vivo imaging of unclamped kidney tissue which is susceptible to changes in blood volume (i.e. active perfusion) and respiration, resulting in a corresponding fluctuation in tissue size and absolute location. Modifying a commercially available TPEFM system, the instrument will be compensating for tissue motion relative to the focal plane (Z axis, as well as X and Y) by developing new methodologies and corresponding algorithms to detect tissue boundaries, and controlling the microscope objective and stage to adjust for movement. This motion compensation function must be accomplished in real-time, and must not affect the normal imaging capabilities of the TPEFM system. 

The Contractor shall also assist in the engineering development of at least two additional SPIS projects: fluorescence photo activation localization microscopy (FPALM) analysis system and an image-base robotic targeting system to control micromanipulators for living biological tissue studies.

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:
The Contractor is required to report the research findings and discuss it with the COTR on a daily basis.  The Contractor will present findings during weekly lab meetings.

Program Management and Control Requirements:
The Contractor is expected to deliver findings in a timely fashion consistent with the specific tasks defined under Contractor Requirements.  The Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) will keep abreast of the progress of the work to determine if the contract requirements are being fulfilled.

Inspection and Acceptance Requirements: 
N/A

Government Responsibilities:
The government will provide on-site laboratory space; furnish all necessary laboratory computer hardware and all instruments necessary to allow the contractor to carry out the research.

Period of Performance:
The period of performance shall be from November 15, 2010 through November 14, 2011. The contractor shall work from 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday; 40 hours per week.  The contractor shall not work federal holidays or weekends.

The estimated level effort for this requirement is not expected to exceed 2080 hours for twelve months.
Services to be performed:
1.)  Develop motion compensation system for in-vivo microscopy
	i) Finalize GPU correlation-based tracking software 
	ii) Develop feature-based motion tracking algorithms to improve tracking frequency 
	iii) Investigate accelerometer sensor for hardware based gross motion compensation
	iv) Publish findings in peer-reviewed journals.

2) Develop segmentation algorithms for creating vascular maps from large 3D datasets acquired with two-photon fluorescence microscope

i) Evaluate existing approaches for extracting connected graphs from 3D volume data
	ii) Develop prototype software in matlab to process previously acquired data
	iii) Work with microcirculation researchers to tune algorithms and interpret results 

Location of Work:
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, within the Systems Biology Center,
10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room B1D511, Bethesda, MD 20892-1061.

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2011-011-DDC The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45 ( October 1,2010).
 
The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.
The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541330, with size standard of $4.5 million. 

The sole source basis is determined based on Mr. Bakalar knowledge, experience, and skills needed  in developing high performance algorithms for graphics processing hardware and has specialized knowledge of adaptive control systems, a field the laboratory will be exploring for potential solutions.  Mr. Bakalar has the experience, expertise, and qualifications to develop custom solutions to sensing and imaging challenges in biological research.  Mr. Bakalar has acquired the knowledge and skills needed for the project at hand. The project requires engineering design of graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated image processing implementations and real-time motion tracking and robotic control algorithm (e.g. 3D volume, control feedback) developments, primarily to further advance the highly specialized TPEFM research methodology.  Integration of many disparate software and hardware modules is essential, and requires advanced knowledge in C/C++, the nVidia CUDA version of C, Java, Python, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.  The tasks also require extensive hands-on experience working on the specific NIH custom TPEFM system requiring the new motion tracking capabilities for advanced in vivo tissue imaging.  Direct experience with the custom NIH system is required because many of the evolving advanced algorithms and design concepts are mid-development; consequently the thorough and efficient completion of the developments is dependent on seamless continued implementation, evaluation, and extensive optimization.  
Therefore, Mr. Bakalar, is the only logical choice based upon all critical factors (i.e. knowledge, skills abilities and experience.

 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 3, 2010, 7:30am Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.

The Government estimates the effort to perform the base requirements of the Statement of Work (Year 1 and Option 1 - additional Years 2 through 7) to be approximately 2.0 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year. Additionally, the anticipated contract award will contain options for increased levels of effort in increments of 10% over the base requirement which can be exercised up to 10 times per contract year. An option for electronic data submission to an internal DAIT-wide system will be included as well. The Government estimates a 10% increase in the total level of effort for this optional activity during the applicable 6-month period. An option for study product validation and identity testing will also be included. The Government estimated a one-time, 12-month 10% increase in the total level of effort for this option.</p>

In addition to the card readers that are maintained by Cafritz Company, EPA currently has 33 card reader that are maintained and monitored by Datawatch Systems.  In addition, there is a CCTV system that was already installed by Datawatch Systems before EPA moved in.  Datawatch also continues to maintain the CCTV System for EPA.
 If the maintenance contract is awarded to any vendor other than Datawatch, approval would have to be obtained from the building owner.  Additionally, the 33 card readers would have to be replaced.  It would be a waste of Federal funds to replace the existing card readers at this time because they will have to be replaced again, in the next couple of years, as the Agency moves toward installing new systems to be compatible with EPASS cards (with chip).  The building owner has stated in that past that they would not allow any other vendor to install readers because building employees would have to carry two different cards to access two types of readers in the building.  
The supplies and services to be provided are commercial within the meaning of FAR Clause 52.212.1.  This statutory authority for other than full and open competition is USC 2304 (c) (1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies who can provide the above listed proprietary items must indicate their interest on or before 12:00 PM local time, Washington, DC, on Friday, October 29, 2010.  Oral communications are not acceptable.  THIS NOTICE SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL.  The purchase order will be issued by November 1, 2010 and will be for a period of 12 months.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

Semi Ruggedized Laptops 
The Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (ORIA/R&IE) in conjunction and collaboration with the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Washington D.C., and Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (ORIA\NAREL) is continuing its effort to provide defensible radiological analytical values to the Public and other Governmental Agencies. R&IE supports Superfund projects in cleanup, removal, remediation, and radiological emergencies. 
EPA under the National Response Plan (NRP) and other federally mandated regulations would be tasked as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) for specific radiological emergency responses. These tasks include but not limited to supplying support equipment, personnel, and radiation detection equipment to EPA Regional personnel and Incident Command Leadership across the North America including Alaska. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION FOR PANASONIC LAPTOPS COMPUTERS:  The purpose of these laptops is to facilitate the Radiation Emergency Response Team's primary and support staff with mobility, connectivity, readiness and easy access to their specialized applications and data resources whether they are at work, travel or responding to an emergency in the field.  It will assist with the consolidation of imperative data that can be readily accessed in an efficient and quickly manner The Panasonic is semi ruggedized with aluminum cases providing additional protection against vibration and shock.   This is the same spec as many regions and the other EPA special teams have purchased for On Scene Coordinator (OSC), ER members etc. A total of 15 semi-ruggedized laptops will be purchased for RERT operations.  Each will be designed and setup similar for consistency in operation. Laptops will be setup at the R&IE facility with identical software, networking functions, cabling, and biometrical passwords features.  The laptops will be designed for semi-rugged handling, network capability and troubleshoot the data-logger on the RadNet-DNRMS, SCRIBE, RERT and regular office applications. On board serial port availability is a must in order to connect radiation detection and air monitoring systems. Additionally, the laptops will serve as desktop replacements.  Users will have traditional monitors and keyboards at their workstations to which the laptops will be docked for regular office network access.  Semi-ruggedized computers will be utilized as office desktops as well as in field operations laptops. For this type of operation, we may be located in areas that require the handling of the laptop on vehicle hoods, off the back end of a trucks tailgate, or a rock out cropping. All of these areas make the laptop vulnerable to falling to the ground. To support such operation a semi-ruggedized laptop to meet RERT specification is ideal.  We need the flexibility to perform emergency repairs and or replacement in the field due to time constraints. These time constraints are driven by an emergency response situation where down time is not a luxury. We need a computer to perform exceptionally well under the harsh mobile environment and are easily upgradeable for future operations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Mr. Jay Oxenberg either by email: jay.oxenberg@gsa.gov or by fax: 215-873-8428.</p>

<DESC>Summary of Statement of Work<BR><BR>Waste Water Treatment Plant relocation involves the following items: <BR>This job consists of removal of an existing 3000 gallon sewage treatment tank and appurtenant pumps and piping in an existing sewage treatment room located within the lower levels of the dam power house facility.  It will require installation of approximately 3000 feet of pipeline; with 1500 feet routed from the sewage treatment room through existing inside pipe chases and galleries of the dam to the downstream end of the navigation lock; and continuing outside of the navigation lock another 1500 feet with buried sewage piping which will end at the new drain field location.  This outside piping will require trenching and backfilling for placement of the buried sewer piping.  The surfacing of the trench will involve asphalt repair, dry land grass seeding, and gravel.  This pipeline will serve to channel septic tank effluent from the sewage treatment room to an external sump for a low pressure pumped drain field.  This effort will also require fabrication and installation of a new sewage tank within the sewage treatment room.  A new pump station is to be installed to transfer the treated liquids.  This station is to include two new pumps and appurtenant valves for fluid control.  A low pressure pump and controls is to be installed to supply the new drain field laterals from a buried sump tank which is to be located and installed adjacent to the required drain field.   The holding tank, pumps, and the drain field are to be installed in an area approximately 1500 feet downstream and approximately 150 feet from an existing well.  A new fence is to be installed around the perimeter of the drain field.  New electrical service will be installed to support the effluent pump and septic tank level controls, electric heat tracing to provide freeze protection for a portion of the pipeline run outside the dam, and to power the drain field injection pumps and their controls.<BR><BR>Solicitation number W912EF-11-B-0001 will be posted to the FBO website on or about November 18, 2010.  Important Note: The FedBizOpps Response Date listed elsewhere in this synopsis is for FedBizOpps archive purposes only.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and shall provide the company Tax Information Number (TIN) with their quote.<br />

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-11-R-0001, for the establishment of a Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) for Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments (MEDE).  The objective of the MEDE CRA PA is to reach out to the national and international materials research community to solicit offers to fulfill strategic U.S. Army fundamental (basic and applied) research goals in material science. Specifically, the U.S. Army wants to develop the capability to design, create, synthesize, process and manufacture high strain rate tolerant material and material systems.  ARL believes that the establishment of a CRA with a parallel and robust internal mission program provides the optimum path to success. Inherent in the decision to seek a CRA is the recognition that significant advances in fundamental multi-scale materials research are occurring in academia, industry and other government agencies. It is the goal of the CRA to create a collaborative environment that enables a research team of academia, government and industry that can advance the state of the art in MEDE and assist with transition of this research to the Army to enhance the performance, lethality and survivability of soldier and ground combat systems.<BR>The MEDE CRA focuses specifically on the extramural program in MEDE and the goals are: (1) drive forward and expand the state of the art in the area of multi-scale materials behavior in ultra-high loading rate environments; (2) execute a focused research program to realize a materials by design capability; (3) develop this capability for the following material classes and systems: metals, ceramics, polymers, composites and hybrids such as metal matrix composites, ceramic matrix composites and hybrids; and (4) create a framework that enhances and fosters cross disciplinary and cross organizational collaboration that brings a team of academia, industry and government together to address critical focused research in MEDE.  To create this collaborative synergy the MEDE CRA will develop a comprehensive and focused basic research program that enables a systematic and synergistic approach with a materials by design strategy to perform the following: (1) Modeling and Simulation; (2) Bridging the Scales: Analysis, Theory and Algorithms; (3) Advanced Experimental Techniques; (4) Multiscale Material Properties; and (5) Processing and Synthesis.  <BR><BR>The DRAFT MEDE CRA PA can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/CRAMEDE.<BR>   <BR>This PA will result in the award of a cooperative agreement (CA) as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the MEDE CRA. The CA will be awarded to a Consortium of organizations that may include academic, industrial and non-profit organizations.  To assure the creation of a well focused research program, the consortium will be kept small, ideally with no more than six members.  The Consortium must be led by an academic institution that will be charged with spearheading the focused research program. Additionally, it is required that covered educational institutions (to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions) shall receive 5-10% of the annual CA funding.<BR><BR>Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the consortium for the MEDE CRA.  Planned funding levels for the CA are set forth in the MEDE CRA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the MEDE CRA for five years with an option for an additional five years. <BR> <BR>An Opportunity Conference will be held on Friday, 19 November 2010 at the Fair Oaks Marriott, Fairfax, VA.  The purpose of the Opportunity Conference is to provide potential offerors with scientific and business information concerning the MEDE CRA and to provide an opportunity for potential offerors to discuss the MEDE CRA with Government personnel.  Details concerning registration and logistics associated with the Opportunity Conference can be found at the MEDE CRA website listed above.  All presentations provided at the Opportunity Conference will be posted subsequently on the MEDE CRA website.  In addition, all questions and answers resulting from the Opportunity Conference that do not include proprietary information will be posted on the MEDE CRA website.  Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the DRAFT MEDE CRA PA prior to attending the Opportunity Conference.  It is noted that this Opportunity Conference will also include a discussion of the DRAFT PA issued under W911NF-11-R-0002 for the Multiscale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials (MSME) CRA.  The DRAFT MSME PA can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/CRAMSME. <BR>   <BR>ARL will host an Open House at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD on 16 December 2010 in connection with the MEDE CRA.  More information on the Open House can be found at the MEDE CRA website.  <BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is issuing a DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-11-R-0002, for the establishment of a Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) for Multiscale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials (MSME).<BR><BR>The purpose of this MSME CRA PA is to solicit offers that will help fulfill the research and development goals of the U.S. Department of the Army.  The Army envisions the Alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to undertake the fundamental research necessary to enable the quantitative understanding of electronic materials from the smallest to the largest relevant scales. Resulting models are needed to create new understanding and improved electronic device applications to include sensors and electronics for enhanced battlespace effects, and efficient power and energy devices. The objective of this CRA is to conduct fundamental research to create MSME to support development of future electronic materials and devices for the Army.  To achieve this, the Alliance is expected to advance the fundamental science, understanding and state-of-the-art (SoA) for Multiscale Multidisciplinary Models in each of the following Electronic Materials Research Areas:  1) Electrochemical Energy Devices, 2) Hybrid Photonic and Spintronic Devices, and 3) Heterogeneous Metamorphic Electronics. The intent is for the Multiscale Models to be developed by the Recipient.  The experimentation for validation and verification for these models will be performed by ARL scientists in each of the three Electronic Materials Research Areas, which is expected to be part of a continual process to improve and create new models through collaboration between ARL and the Recipient. Programmatically, the CRA should initiate and execute a fundamental, cohesive, multidisciplinary collaborative research program that links MSME across length and time scales with validated modeling.   Responses to the PA are expected to provide a plan to perform materials by design by addressing the following Multiscale Modeling Research core elements for each of the Electronic Materials Research Areas above: 1) Modeling and Simulation, 2) Bridging the Scales, 3) Multiscale Material Metrics, 4) Validation and Verification, and 5) Processing and Synthesis.   Innovative crosscutting themes across both the Electronic Materials and Modeling Research areas are envisioned to advance the SoA as part of this initiative.<BR><BR>The DRAFT MSME CRA PA can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/CRAMSME.    <BR><BR>This PA will result in the award of a cooperative agreement (CA) as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the MSME CRA. The CA will be awarded to a single Recipient academic institution, but is expected to include participation by additional institutions.  Additionally, it is required that covered educational institutions (to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions) shall receive 5-10% of the annual CA funding.<BR><BR>Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the recipient for the MSME CRA.

<DESC>Sole Source.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Yuma Proving Ground,  Arizona, intents to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with Mike Wills Excavating and Trucking, Inc.  The contract will consist of Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001, Quantity: 1, Unit of Issue: Lump Sum, Description: Design/Maintain test tracks at the CRTC as well as train CRTC personnel how to build an ice field, snowfield, snow transition circle, ice pad, and ice slopes at 15% and 20 %.  Place of performance is Cold Regions Test Center, Alaska.  Period of performance is 8  24 November 2010.  Stated firm is the only source capable of meeting immediate CRTC requirements within mandated test tolerances.  Work will be accomplished in accordance with the following performance work statement:<BR><BR>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PRS)<BR>CONSULTING/TRAINING and MAINTENANCE for WINTER SEASON 2010<BR><BR>1. The contractor must train 4 CRTC personnel in the following areas: <BR><BR>	a. The contractor will train CRTC personnel to build and maintain a split mu ice pad 25 wide by 350 long. The ice pad will be built in layers until it is 1 thick. The edges of the split mu must be dressed so that there is a clear, straight defining edge between the ice and the pavement it is built on. The surface must be polished (with high spinning brooms) twice daily to keep it the proper condition. Every other day a new layer of water will be added to the ice so the surface continues to meet the customer requirements.<BR><BR>	b.  The contractor will train CRTC personnel to build and maintain a large ice pad 140 wide by 900 long. The ice pad will be built in layers until it is 1 thick. The edges of the pad must be dressed so that there is a clear, straight defining edge between the ice and the pavement it is built on. The surface must be polished (with high spinning brooms used twice daily to keep it the proper condition). Every day a new layer of water will be added to the ice so the surface continues to meet the customer requirements.<BR><BR>	c.  The contractor will train CRTC personnel to build and maintain a large snowfield. The snowfield will be built in layers until it is 6 thick, with a compactness value of 72 to 80 as measured using a snow compactness gauge or cone penetrometer provided by the contractor. The gauge is composed of a rail and a 220 gram drop cone (SAE 1985). The contractor must use the CTI compaction range (steel is 100 and water has a value of 1). The contractor must train CRTC personnel how to change the value of snow compactness (by adding small amount of water to the existing snow, by making new snow, by packing the existing snow with heavy weights on sleds or by loosening the surface of the existing snow), or other industry stanards. The edges of the field must include 2 snow berms the entire length of the field (1250). New snow must be added to the surface daily to fill ruts and grooves caused by vehicle tires. Then the surface must be leveled using a sled, wobble wheels, and or a Small Unit Squad Vehicle (SUSV). Snowmaking equipment and Kenworth water trucks will be used to make snow when natural snow is not available. The ability to make and evenly spread and compact snow over large areas is important. The surface compactness must be checked every 100 on the center of the snow lane every morning, the compactness value will be provided to CRTC prior to 7AM each morning.<BR><BR>	d.  The contractor will train CRTC personnel to build and maintain a large ice and snow circle (600 across). The snow and ice will be built in layers until the ice is approximately 1 thick, and the snow is approximately 4-6 thick. The snow must have a compactness value of 72 to 80 as measured using a snow compactness gauge (cone penetrometer). The inside of the circle will be clean (brushed) pavement. The ice lane will be 25 wide; the snow lane will be on the outside of the ice lane and be 100 wide. Again, the contract must provide a packed snow surface that measures 72-80 using the CTI compaction range (steel is 100 and water has a value of 1). The outside edges of the circle must include 2 snow berms the entire circumference of the field. New snow must be added to the surface daily to fill ruts and grooves causes by vehicle tires. The ability to make and evenly spread and compact snow over large areas is important. The surface must be leveled using a sled, wobble wheels, and or a Small Unit Squad Vehicle (SUSV). The surface compactness must be checked every 100 on the center of the snow lane every morning, the compactness value will be provided to CRTC prior to 7AM each morning. The surface must be polished (with high spinning brooms) twice daily to keep it the proper condition. Every day a new layer of water will be added to the ice so the surface continues to meet the customer requirements.<BR><BR>	e. The contractor will train CRTC personnel to build and maintain ice pads on two slopes at 15% and 20%. Water will be applied to the slopes in small amounts to build ice pads on the outside of the paved slopes. The ice pads will be 25 long, 2 wide and layered until they are 1 thick. The technique to lay water on a slope to build an even, layered surface has been tried by CRTC on numerous occasions, we have never been successful. The contractor has the knowledge and expertise to accomplish this customer requirement.<BR><BR>2. The contractor must provide one equipment operator/assistant. <BR><BR>3. The contractor must be willing to travel to Alaska and work for the duration of the contract period. <BR><BR>4. Weather conditions will vary during the test period. The contractor will be expected to work in all weather conditions to include temperatures as low as -50F. Most work accomplished will be done using artificial light sources. <BR><BR>5. The contractor and the assistant must be willing to work 12 hour days, 6 days per week (Monday  Saturday). Hours of operation are not set. Hours will vary with weather conditions. <BR><BR>6. The contractor must have past experience working with a variety of automotive manufacturers and suppliers (i.e. tire companies, brake companies&). <BR><BR>7. The contractor experience must include the construction of winter driving courses, the daily maintenance of those courses and technical proficiency at making snow compactness measurements, and changing those measurements.<BR><BR>8. The contractor, through past experience must understand the secretive nature of working around prototype passenger vehicles.  The contractor must be familiar with the industry expectations.<BR>	<BR><BR><BR><BR>9. The government will provide the following equipment.  The contractor must be an expert on the operation and maintenance of all listed equipment.<BR><BR>1.	Caterpillar Grader<BR>2.	Caterpillar 990 Loader with snow removal attachment, and bucket attachment.<BR>3.	Kenworth dump truck<BR>4.	Kenworth water truck (3000 gallons)<BR>5.	Piston Bully Snow Cat<BR>6.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/SPECIAL NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services and related products to continue the development of a systematic process for the estimation of shrimp fishing effort in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA intends to establish a system of automated processes to improve the estimation of total shrimp fishing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the fourth part of an ongoing project to develop and establish a permanent shrimp fishing effort data acquisition program to be managed by NOAA Fisheries Service in cooperation with the commercial shrimp industry. The electronic logbook (ELB) methodology and technology was originally developed as prototypes by LGL Ecological Research Associates, Inc., (LGL), of Bryan, Texas, while a subcontractor to the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Foundation, Inc., (Foundation), under a series of financial assistance awards from NOAA Fisheries Service. The first contract included development, production, and placement of the first 50 ELB units and associated memory modules; development of presentation materials, and preparation for and facilitation of port meetings with interested parties. The second contract covered the purchasing of 200 ELB unit materials and associated memory modules; production of the remaining 100 ELB units and associated memory modules; assembly and placement of 100 of those units on vessels identified through scientific random selection processes; purchasing in the last four months of Phase II the raw materials of the last 100 ELB units to be assembled and placed on vessels in the first year of Phase III; collection of data from the first 50 ELB units and from the next 100 ELB units after they are placed; comparison of the ELB data with port agent records for the corresponding vessels, periods, and locations; facilitation of additional port meetings; development and refinement of the data base and algorithms for data comparisons; and reporting and recommendations to the Government, the shrimping community, and other interested parties on the findings of the data collection and analysis processes. Phase III covered the assembly and placement of 100 ELB units on vessels, production of 200 additional ELB units and associated memory modules bringing the total of units to 450. Also, Phase III covered the performance of analyses and reports on a quarterly and annual basis through the period of performance. The contractor will provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, supplies, and other direct items of expense necessary to perform the required services. The period of performance will begin October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, with 4, 12-month option years. Services include, but are not limited to: the purchase and assembly of parts and components to replace any ELB units on vessels identified through the established scientific random selection process for selecting vessels. This process will be provided to the contractor at the time of a contract award; using the replacement ELB units (furnished government equipment) to serve as a pool of replacement units to assure that once the original placements have been made, there will be no less than 400 placed and continuously operating ELB units at all times in offshore waters during the course of the contract period; purchasing and assembling the parts and components to add 100 units in inshore vessels in Louisiana; downloading and analyzing shrimp fishing effort data from all existing ELB units in operation throughout the course of the contract period; refining and improving the existing analytical software and algorithms to enhance effort estimates in order to provide a self contained fully functional operating system at the end of the contract period; providing quarterly progress reports and a final year end summary report of progress; developing operational manuals for estimating shrimp fishing effort from the combined resources of the ELB records and the landings data. The purpose of this notice is to identify businesses that are capable of performing the required services. All interested parties must submit their company information to the attention of Jackie Shewmaker at Jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov, no later than November 10, 2010. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<CONTACT>Kimberly Dvila, Email kimberly.davila@dia.mil - Allison Richards, Contract Specialist, Email allison.richardson@dia.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: This announcement is for the Empire Challenge 2011 (EC11) Event scheduled for live execution 20 Jun-1 Jul 2011. Empire Challenge is an Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) sponsored, U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) executed joint/combined Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) interoperability demonstration. EC11 will focus on improving ISR support to operational and tactical forces, and enhancing multinational intelligence information sharing, including information sharing with multinational government and non-government activities, with particular emphasis on the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E). <br />This announcement is not a request for proposal; no contract award shall be made as a result of this announcement.
<p>Added: Empire Challenge 2011</p>
<p>1. Event Description <br />EC11 will consist of ISR interoperability events using a combination of live, laboratory, and modeling &amp; simulation activities, to demonstrate and assess potential solutions to identified warfigher ISR requirements, including multinational requirements from Afghanistan. EC11 will conduct operations simulating elements of a multinational force, with an emphasis at the Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below, in an operationally representative, live environment. EC11 is scheduled for live execution 20 Jun-1 Jul 2011 at Ft Huachuca, AZ, and other distributed venues.</p>
<p>2. Joint Capability Threads and Objectives <br />EC11 Joint Capability Threads (JCTs) are supported by associated objectives developed at the Concept Development Conference (CDC), and based on inputs from USD/(I), Service, Defense Agency, and Coalition Community stakeholders. The JCTs and baseline objectives reflect the following themes:</p>
<p>a. Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) Interoperability: The DI2E is a cross-domain, globally-connected, agile intelligence information enterprise that meets the needs of Combatant Commanders, as well as Joint Task Forces and Services, and is designed to maximize their access to and sharing of intelligence information. The DI2E consists of the Joint Intelligence Operations Center-Information Technology (JIOC-IT) and Distributed Common Ground / Surface System (DCGS) Enterprises. The DI2E seeks to seamlessly incorporate important new capabilities in the emerging intelligence community architectures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. Provide measurable artifacts enabling assessment of JIOC-IT and DCGS Enterprises interoperability using existing and new alternative operational mission threads.</p>
<p>ii. Demonstrate interoperability of JIOC-IT and DCGS Enterprises with multinational and whole-of-government partners.</p>
<p>iii. Demonstrate ISR Management (ISRM) across the enterprise and with multinational partners using existing and new alternative operational mission threads to develop pre-defined and ad hoc ISR products.</p>
<p>iv. Demonstrate and assess the DI2E Framework - core infrastructure services, Apps store, and others.</p>
<p>v. Integrate CI/HUMINT tools and net-enabling capabilities within the DI2E Enterprise and C2 architecture, to maximize access to and sharing of CI/HUMINT intelligence information.</p>
<p><br />b. National-to-Tactical Interoperability and to Support Full-Spectrum Operations: Use of national assets to support operational and tactical operations. Ensure data is disseminated to appropriate C4ISR elements.</p>
<p>i. Institutionalize Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations (AOCO) by addressing actions in AOCO DOTMLPF Change Recommendation (DCR) Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 101-10.</p>
<p>ii. Expand demonstration of soldier hand-held devices and applications.</p>
<p>iii. Demonstrate the capability to employ commercial Space-based assets to support targeting in operational timelines.</p>
<p>iv. Demonstrate integration of the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) into the Coalition Four Eyes (CFE) Common Operational Picture (COP).</p>
<p>c. Wide Area/Persistent Surveillance (WAPS) Support to Operational and Tactical Forces: Gain universal insight into end-to-end Tasking, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) operations, analysis, fusion and production management for the full spectrum of Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) requirements, missions and assets. Demonstrate multi-INT and multi-level tasking, feedback and evaluation Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to drive the appropriate level tasking regardless of asset ownership and demonstration of effective data standards and data tagging procedures to facilitate the discovery, integration, retention and sharing of WAS data and information as well as visualization of WAS derived information via the COP</p>
<p>i. Demonstrate the ability to conduct WAPS in a coalition environment.</p>
<p>ii. Refine collection &amp; TPED management processes and TTPs to enable tasking of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ISR assets to provide WAPS over key terrain for a specified period.</p>
<p>iii. Manage, store and disseminate large persistent data sets to the DI2E and warfighter at the tactical edge.</p>
<p>iv. Automate/assist in the processing of WAPS data to alert operators to potential targets of interest.</p>
<p>v. Integrate combined/coalition multi-INT sensors and PED nodes to enable tipping and cuing to provide WAPS.</p>
<p><br />d. Intelligence Information Sharing With Multinational Government and Non-Government Activities: The process of providing ISR support to non-military operations (i.e. Natural Disaster Relief). Improved situational awareness for decision-makers to include civil leaders (i.e. host-nation officials), military commanders and humanitarian support organizations (e.g. Red Cross/Crescent).</p>
<p><br />i. Create an open information sharing environment.</p>
<p>ii. Develop a means for validation of information obtained through open sources.</p>
<p>iii. Develop a method of tagging open-source information for ingestion into Coalition systems.</p>
<p>iv. Automated exchange of ISR data to support stability operations</p>
<p>e. Enhanced ISR-C2 System Interoperability to Support Operational and Tactical Forces: Integrate ISR and C2 systems for a complete battlefield snapshot with the intended result of improved situational awareness from space to tactical levels.</p>
<p><br />i. Improve joint, coalition and multinational forces interoperability across domains between C2 systems, Service DCGS, and the DI2E.</p>
<p>ii. Enhance information sharing to support increased situation awareness, lethal and non-lethal effects, and force protection.</p>
<p>iii. Provide total asset management for ISR support to targeting, mission planning, and mission execution.</p>
<p><br />3. Coalition Participation</p>
<p>Coalition participation is key to the success of EC11. The anticipated international participants include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO and ISAF-member nations. Command echelons to be simulated include: Multinational HQ; COCOM JIOC Response Cell; an ISAF Regional Command-like command entity; a Multinational Brigade Combat Team TOC (Live); and, US, UK and Canadian Forward Operating Bases (FOBs).</p>

Scope of WorkModel Bison Genetic Diversity at the 100, 200 and 500 Year Marks using 3 Culling Strategies
Background
The Department of Interior (DOI) manages an estimated 6,200 bison.  Of these, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) manage approximately 1,450 bison in herds at 6 National Wildlife Refuges.  These bison largely descend from foundation herds established at the turn of the 20th century, and have been managed separately with limited animal transfers between the DOI herds.  Additionally, these herds have limited available habitat, and culling through auction or donation is needed periodically at most Refuges.
The DOI launched a Bison Conservation Initiative that outlined specific actions for DOI bison herd managers, including managing "DOI herds through conservation of genetic variation and natural selection".  A genetics workshop, conducted in September of 2008, specifically identified research needed to evaluate the effect of various culling strategies on bison genetic diversity.  
Scope
Using microsatellite and parentage data provided for a representative FWS bison herd, the project will model bison genetic diversity at the 100, 200 and 500 year marks, using each of the following 3 culling strategies:
1.  All-allele conservation strategy:  given a post-culling herd size objective with an even sex ratio, yearling animals are chosen for retention based on presence of rare alleles.  These alleles are ranked in priority, based on allele frequency in the herd, and animals containing more than one rare allele, in priority, are chosen for conservation.  If more than one animal contains such alleles, the decision is based on minimizing introgression and maintaining a balanced age and sex ratio within the herd.
2.  Pedigree-based strategy: given a post-culling herd size objective with an even sex ratio, yearling animals are chosen for culling based on the highest degree of relatedness to the rest of the herd.  If more than one animal meets the relatedness culling criteria, the decision is based on minimizing introgression and maintaining a balanced age and sex ratio within the herd.
3.  Random removal of young: given a post-culling herd size objective with an even sex ratio, calves and yearlings are randomly chosen for culling.  A similar model has recently been completed for other DOI bison herds, but has not been compared to strategies 1 or 2.
Government Furnished Information
Data provided includes: 1. individual animal data at approximately 30 microsatellites used to evaluate genetic diversity in a FWS bison herd; and, 2. parentage data from this same herd will also be provided.
Rights in Data
Publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals may be pursued, and is, in fact, highly encouraged. However, the Government maintains "Unlimited rights in data" meaning that the rights of the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others to do so is not restricted in any way. 
Deliverables
Deliverable will be a final technical report provided by August 30, 2011, that contains the following:
1. Final report including model designs, parameterizations and assumptions, diversity estimates at 100, 200 and 500 years for all 3 culling strategies over time including heterozygosity and allelic richness measures, and discussion with recommendations for conservation of bison genetic diversity through annual culling.2. Pedigree or relatedness measures used for the pedigree strategy.3. Basic model parameterization and assumptions for the random removal strategy.
Schedule
The delivery date for project completion and the final technical report is August 30, 2012

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541430 with a small business size of $7,000,000.00. <br /><br />The following provisions and/or clauses apply to this acquisition: <br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. <br />a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Price<br />2. Technical capability<br />3. Past performance (see FAR 15.304)<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>1.0. Introduction: This is a competitive best value solicitation. The offeror's technical ability and past performance will be considered significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>2.0. General Basis for Award: The Government seeks to award to an offeror who gives the Air Force the best value. This competitive best value, performance price tradeoff will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 12, FAR 13.106 and FAR 15).</p>
<p>2.1 "Offeror shall submit a quote on company letterhead with the name, address, and telephone number (s), provide for a delivery/completion time, address technical ability as related to the attached Statement of Work, Past Performance information, Price, and terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>3.0. Evaluation: Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated against the following factors: technical evaluation, past performance, and price. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The team will evaluate information received from the offeror regarding technical ability, performance of current or past contracts, and other credible or supportable information available to adequately measure the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of the resulting contract. The offeror's technical ability and past performance shall be significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>4.0. Technical Ability and Past Performance: The Government reserves the right to obtain and evaluate technical ability and past performance information from any source it deems appropriate. The purpose of the technical and past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past technical capabilities and performance.</p>
<p>4.1 The Government may seek any relevant performance information on the offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>4.2 The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Confidence, or No Confidence.</p>
<p>4.3 To be considered technically capable, the offeror must be able to perform the services requested in the attached Statement of Work. Submissions shall be limited to a maximum of 15 pages. The technical ability confidence assessment verbiage is as follows:<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL RATINGS<br />Color Rating Description<br /><br />Blue Exceptional Exceeds specified minimum technical capability requirements listed in the Statement of Work in a way beneficial to the government. A proposal must have one or more strength and no deficiencies to receive a blue.<br /><br />Green Acceptable Meets specified minimum technical capability requirements as listed in the Statement of Work. A proposal must have no deficiencies to receive a green but may have one or more strengths.<br /><br />Yellow Marginal There is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets specified minimum technical capability requirements, but any such uncertainty is correctable.<br /><br />Red Unacceptable Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal has one or more deficiencies and is not awardable.</p>
<p>4.4 The Past Performance confidence assessment verbiage is as follows:</p>
<p>TABLE 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS<br />Description<br /><br />High Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, essentially no doubt exists the offeror will successfully perform the required efforts.<br /><br />Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, extreme doubt exists the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>4.4.1 An offeror with limited or no recent or relevant past performance will receive a rating of Unknown Confidence, and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Definitions of relevancy and recency are as follows:</p>
<p>Relevancy: Commercial or Government contracts which perform Graphics Visual Media Support or contracts of similar or equivalent magnitude as identified in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>Recency: For a past performance evaluation to be considered recent, the contract should be performed or have been completed within the two years from this solicitation issue date: The offeror shall provide a list of the most recent and relevant past and present contracts in the area of Graphics Visual Media Support performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within two years from this solicitation issue date. Limited to five contract actions.</p>
<p>5.0 Price Evaluation: For the purpose of selecting the successful offeror, technical ability and past performance are considered significantly more important than price. While Price will not be evaluated in terms of acceptable/unacceptable or assigned a confidence rating, as is the technical ability and past performance criteria, it will be evaluated in terms of fairness and reasonableness. After the technical ability and past performance evaluation factors have been completed, price will be evaluated to determine the combination most advantageous to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced proposal based on the integrated best value award assessment. Unrealistically low price proposals, as part of the initial proposal, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.</p>
<p>5.1 This criterion evaluates the overall price to the Government and determines the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>5.2 Proposed prices will be evaluated to determine if prices are unreasonably high or low in relation to the Government's independent price estimate and other offeror's proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5.3 One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis:</p>
<p>5.3.1 Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5.3.2 Comparison of prior prices paid by the Government with current proposed prices for the same or similar end items.</p>
<p>5.3.3 Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.</p>
<p>5.3.4 Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. Proposals unrealistically high or low in cost or price, when compared to the Government estimate may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of understanding of risks of the solicitation requirement and may result in proposal rejection.</p>
<p>6.0 Competitive range: The Government also reserves the right to limit, for purposes of efficiency, the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the contracting officer decides that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for award and written notice of the decision shall be provided to the unsuccessful offeror in accordance with FAR 15.503.<br /><br />The Following Provisions and/or Clauses apply to this acquisition:<br />FAR 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items including subparagraphs<br />FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside<br />FAR 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Representation<br />FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor<br />FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities<br />FAR 52-222-26 Equal Opportunity<br />FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities <br />FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965<br />FAR 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hire -- Supplemented per following addenda: In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, this clause identifies the wages and fringe benefits payable to each employee if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332. <br />Employee Class: GS-11 <br />Monetary Wage/Fringe Benefits: $25.25/hour<br />FAR 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons<br />FAR 52.223-18 Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving<br />FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases<br />FAR 52.233-3 Protest after Award<br />FAR 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim<br />DFARS 252.203-7000 Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items<br />DFARS 252.225-7001 Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program<br />DFARS 252.225-7036 Buy American Act- Free Trade Agreements- Balance of Payments Program<br />DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports<br />DFARS 252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments</p>

<p><strong><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<SUBJECT>Joint Future Theatre Lift (JFTL) Technology Study (JTS) Capability Request for Information (CRFI)
<SOLNBR>XR-20-OCT-10
<RESPDATE>122210
<CONTACT>Anthony L. Fisher, Contracting Officer, Phone 9372557761, Email anthony.fisher@wpafb.af.mil - Pete Kronbergs, Phone 937-904-4499, Email pete.kronbergs@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Requirements and Capabilities Integration Directorate, ASC/XR, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing a Capability Request for Information (CRFI). THIS IS A CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This CRFI solicits information from Department of Defense (DoD ), other government agencies, US and/or foreign companies who can provide promising technologies and system concepts that can achieve a Joint Future Theater Lift (JFTL) capability. The Government will use the CRFI responses to inform on-going cost and capability analyses and provide an analytical foundation to inform the FY14 Program Objective Memorandum (POM). Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this CRFI in order to assist ASC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry.
<p>This CRFI initiates a call to investigate the realm of the possible in regards to aircraft concepts and associated technologies which could support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) Joint Future Theater Lift Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) requirement. The Government will consider system concepts having anticipated technology and manufacturing readiness levels (TRL/MRL) of 6 no later than 2019. TRL/MRL applies to fully mission capable aircraft and their associated technologies and integrated logistics support (training, maintenance, supply, support equipment, etc).</p>
<p>JFTL is envisioned as a next generation theater lift capability that enables routine logistics and payload delivery/extraction airlift missions into complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas. JFTL capabilities will significantly contribute to the following operations within the Range of Military Operations: theater airlift of cargo and passengers, combat employment and sustainment (expanded to include Mounted Vertical Maneuver), aero-medical evacuation, support of special operations, forcible entry, strikes and raids, support of irregular warfare, noncombatant evacuation operations, recovery operations, and homeland defense. JFTL will be required to provide movement, maneuver, and distributed sustainment in an environment where increased capacity, speed, payload, range, agility, access, depth, precision, simultaneity and survivability will be at a premium. JFTL airlift capabilities will need to provide the battle space access, precision of delivery, and responsiveness of action needed for rapid decision. To do this, the JFTL will be capable of (1) moving medium-weight armored vehicles and personnel to strategic, operationally and tactically significant depths and (2) supporting maneuver in close proximity to objectives and sustainment of distributed forces in complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas to point of need/point of effect. The platform must be able to carry and/or airdrop required cargo loads into and out of complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas (requiring no additional infrastructure or material handling support equipment) and exploiting these landing areas to achieve runway-independent takeoff and landing operations. JFTL must also be capable of operating in adverse weather conditions and in low to medium threat environments (2024+). <br /><br />More detailed JFTL requirements can be found in the attached detailed JTS CRFI that accompanies this posting.<br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Further, ASC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>The submitted documentation will not be returned. This CRFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this CRFI. Responders are not limited to a single response. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps site (www.fbo.gov) for additional information pertaining to this CRFI.</p>
<p>The Government will accept written questions from Industry related to this CRFI via email until 1700 EDT on&nbsp;5 November 2010. Questions should be submitted to the POCs listed below. The Government reserves the right to not address questions received after this date.</p>
<p>The Government team will post written responses to the submitted questions on the FedBizOpps site not later than 19 November 2010. Do not submit questions containing proprietary information, as all questions and answers will be made publicly available on the FedBizOpps site. The Government reserves the right to not address questions it deems to contain proprietary information.</p>

Maximum page limit for responses is seventy-five (75) pages and must be indexed with respect to the outline of this CRFI, allowing for information to be easily located. Tables delivered in spreadsheet format will not count towards the page limit. Respondents must limit administrative and company/agency overviews to four (4) pages. <br /><br />Multiple concepts from a single company are permissible. 75-page limit, per concept, applies.</p>
<p>Submit UNCLASSIFIED responses in electronic form only via e-mail or by sending the responses on a single compact disk (700 MB CD compatible with Microsoft Windows) by mail. Submit email responses to pete.kronbergs@wpafb.af.mil with "Response to JTS CRFI" in the subject line of the e-mail.

<p>Repair Contract for Landing Gear Components for C-130, KC-135A/R, E-3 aircraft</p>
<p>NAICS: 336413<br />Contracting Office Address<br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Global Logistics Support Center, 448 SCMG/PKAB 6050 Gum Lane (Bldg 1215), Hill AFB, UT, 84056-5825.<br />Description<br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources of repair that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. <br />The Landing Gear Supply Chain Management office is considering competing the repair/overhaul of landing gear components associated with the C-130 (all models), KC-135A/R, and E-3 (all models). This contract will initially encompass all three aircraft weapon systems; however, the Air Force may decide to reduce or eliminate the requirement for contract repair on one or more weapon system at its discretion. An initial list of National Stock Number Items being considered for inclusion on a contract have been attached to aid in planning, however this list may be modified prior to solicitation. <br />Landing Gear Component Repair is a major depot-level repair program for the USAF. This activity will procure the capability to repair and overhaul current landing gear and return serviceable landing gear components for the Landing Gear Component Repair program.</p>
<p><br />Special Considerations</p>
<p>Contract award decision may be based upon an evaluation of cost and non-cost factors (i.e., technical capability, past performance, etc.).</p>
<p>Minimum Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>The Minimum Mandatory Requirements (MMR) reflects the government's minimum needs and are the lowest threshold acceptable. Failure to comply with the MMR will cause a proposal to be rejected.</p>
<p>--The contractor would be expected to ramp up for production in 180 days or less after contract award, with initial deliveries to begin 60 days or less thereafter.</p>
<p>--The government would expect to see a company capable of performing in the magnitude of 10,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of hydraulic components and 80,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of landing gear components within the last five years.</p>
<p>--Engineering and other key personnel shall be familiar with landing gear overhaul. They shall be able to communicate in English with Air Force personnel verbally and in writing. Technical personnel shall be able to interpret engineering and technical data written in English. The contractor shall be able to perform the contract requirements from the data provided in English.</p>
<p><br />RFI</p>
<p>1. Are you a qualified source to repair landing gear components? If so, by whom are you qualified and for what components? <br />2. What is your experience providing landing gear (or similar) repair?<br />3. If this workload were to encounter a split award, what would be the impact on your <br />own participation? From your perspective, what would be the best arrangement for a <br />split award?<br />4. The current government plan for this effort is not to offer Government Furnished <br />Equipment (GFE).<br />a. What equipment, tooling and fixtures do you have in your possession that would allow you to do this work? <br />b. What equipment, tooling or fixtures would you need to acquire that would allow you to do this work?<br />6. Based on the list of components requiring repair, the drawings for those components and the parts required to repair them, do you feel you have adequate storage space for receiving both end items and components while awaiting formal induction to work?<br />7.

<DESC>The U. S. Army RDECOM Contracting, Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager-Individual Protection has a requirement for a Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE I1). The UIPE I1 will be a single supplemental system that will provide enhanced individual protective capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of psychological, physiological and heat stress associated with garment thermal burden, weight and bulk.  It is not intended to replace currently fielded CB garments but will provide an alternative lightweight capability for selected missions.  The UIPE I1 will provide protection from CB warfare agents to include retaining protection after exposure to Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) and other environmental contaminants.  The garment will be suitable for wear while performing combat operations, whether on land or at sea, in any climate, with minimal impact on combat effectiveness.  It will be designed to permit efficient communications and be compatible with current and developmental protective component systems.  It will also be compatible with current and developmental clothing and equipment including load-bearing equipment, helmets (i.e., cranial protection), handwear, footwear, body cooling systems, and protective masks of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the US Navy (USN).  Complete UIPE I1 performance requirements will be delineated in a detailed System Performance Specification (SPS).<BR><BR>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a UIPE I1 that will reduce thermal and physiological burden and reduce weight and bulk, over current Chemical-Biological (CB) protective garments.  Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the UIPE I1 by basing the design on a modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product is central to the acquisition strategy.<BR><BR>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type in which Delivery Orders may be issued for a one year base period and four, one year option periods. The Government envisions delivery orders which shall be Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. The guaranteed minimum order will be the negotiated value of the first delivery order, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $129,000,000 over the life of the contract.<BR><BR>The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. <BR><BR>A small business goal of 30% is in effect and proposals shall address the small business plan. NAICS Code 315211 - Mens and Boys Cut and Sew Apparel Contractors applies with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.<BR><BR>The Government currently estimates that the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be released within the next 45 days, and proposals will be due 30 days after the RFP is released.<BR><BR>Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to John Conlin at john.conlin3@us.army.mil. All proposals shall be sent to the address and in the format specified in the solicitation.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS CONTRACTING ACTION IS BEING OFFERED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND RE-INVESTMENT ACT (ARRA). The Forest Service has a requirement for crushing and stockpiling gravel from the Big Creek gravel pit. The source of the material to be crushed is a Government-owned pit on the National Forest System land. This pit has been used before to produce crushed aggregate for road surfacing. The Quality control of all work performed to provide the end product is the Offeror's responsibility. The Government will inspect the work periodically to ensure quality is being met. Project Location: The Big Creek Gravel Pit is located on the Superior Ranger District, Lolo National Forest, Mineral County, Montana, on the Big Creek Road No.386, Forest Road No. 18654. No pre-quote Site Visit is scheduled, however, Offerors are encouraged to visit the site and review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision #52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (Apr 1984). Failure of the Offeror to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the Offeror from the resposibility for successfully performing the work without addtional expense to the Government. Any questions regarding the project may be directed to Nate Kegel, at (406) 822-3927. The project cost estimate is $250,000 - $500,000. All work must be completed by 01 September 2011. All responsible Offerors may submit a quote which will be considered by the Government, IAW FAR 4.1102(a), and prospective must be registered in CCR.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for a regulatory management center that will provide Regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance support to DAIT Office of Regulatory Affairs for trials conducted under all Networks funded by DAIT NIAID as well as for trials conducted by individual Principal Investigator's funded by DAIT through a non-Network Mechanism. The scope of this contract will cover all trials whether conducted under Health Authority Application or not.
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy,<br />Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. This includes support for clinical research programs and individual research projects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.</p>
<p>As the sponsor of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications for a large number of DAIT-supported clinical trials, there is an established requirement for DAIT to provide regulatory support to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312, and Title 45 CFR Part 46. In addition, all DAIT-supported clinical trials, including those conducted under FDA regulation, as well as IND/IDE-exempt studies and trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines: E2A Clinical Safety Data Management and E6 Good Clinical Practices (GCP), as well as country-specific regulatory regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish a Division-wide Regulatory Management Center to: (1) centralize all regulatory support services for DAIT-funded clinical research programs, currently carried out under multiple grants and contracts, into a single contract dedicated to regulatory affairs; (2) provide regulatory support services for individual clinical trial projects conducted under investigator-initiated cooperative agreement grants within a centralized contract; and (3) provide regulatory support services for future DAIT-supported clinical research programs and individual projects.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall serve as the DAIT Regulatory Management Center (RMC) with responsibility for carrying out a broad range of technical and administrative regulatory support functions for the Division's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), and for working with other DAIT scientific/clinical staff responsible for the conduct and oversight of clinical trials, Principal Investigators (PIs) and other senior staff of DAIT-supported clinical research programs and their clinical sites, investigators conducting individual clinical trial projects, and industry collaborators. Support shall be provided for clinical trials conducted under INDs/IDEs and IND/IDE-exempt (non-IND/IDE) clinical trials.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded. The Government estimates the effort to perform the base requirements of the Statement of Work (Year 1 and Option 1 - additional Years 2 through 10) to be approximately 5.50 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year. Additionally, the anticipated contract award will contain options for increased levels of effort in increments of 25% over the base requirement which can be exercised up to 3 times per contract year. Options for electronic data submission to an internal DAIT-wide system as well electronic submission of IND/IDE documents to the FDA will be included. The Government estimates a 10% increase in the level of effort for each optional activity during the applicable period.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about November 18, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>1.	This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies available in the next one year to provide new or enhanced current electronic warfare distributed test and training capabilities for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) weaponry. The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) is interested in reviewing the state-of-the-art and emerging technologies applicable to distributed physics Based AEA object models.

2.	The objective of this request is to identify consistent, physics based approaches on how to adjudicate Radio Frequency Jammers and Emitters across the Joint Forces Command Information Operations Range (IOR) to support the Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) Modeling and Simulation Federation.

3.	Background: The parametric data and algorithms essential to accurately replicate jamming effects in a simulated, distributed environment are at a very rudimentary level, if defined at all.
  Especially for newer systems, the parameters of the jamming systems and their effects on targets are not very well known. Furthermore, the algorithms which do exist are largely physics constructs and do a poor job of replicating the real world with all the environmental factors.

3.1.	Manual operator intervention is required for consistent representation of jamming effects across the federates.  If a desired jamming effect is clearly defined by the Navys Jammer Techniques Optimization (JATO) group, then there is likely a manual method which could be devised to generate the desired effect.  The success in our ability to manually depict jamming effects is highly dependent on the ability of the model to replicate the desired jammer characteristics, replicate the effects on the targeted system(s), as well as how long and how wide spread the effects are.
  Since execution depends on manual control to achieve a desired jamming effect, the success of replicating the effect diminishes the more complex, wide scale and long term the jamming event is.

3.2.	DEPARTMENT OF NAVY APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) JOINT, DISTRIBUTED TESTING OF ELECTRONIC WARFARE BATTLE MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRO-MAGNETIC BATTLE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF EW TECHNIQUES, TACTICS AND PROCEDURES ALONG WITH SUPPORT FOR MILITARY TRAINING EXERCISES INVOLVING GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED TRAINING FACILITIES.

4.	Submittals must address:
4.1.	The necessary processing requirements, network requirements and open architecture characteristics of the identified approach.
 It should demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through simple modeling examples that validate the ability to conduct AEA testing and training events on the IOR such that jammer and emitter algorithms will not be susceptible to inherent latencies of the IOR network.
4.2.	How high fidelity jammer models can be integrated with Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) and Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM) to replicate the effects of EA-6B and EA-18G ALQ-99 and Digital Radio Frequency Modulation (DRFM) jamming on Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) and communication devices, as applicable. 
4.3.	In what way high fidelity emitter models can be integrated with TENA and JIMM to replicate the effects of IADS on Tactical Jammer Receiver Systems (TJRS) such as the ALQ-218 and DRFM Receiver Systems.
 
4.4.	To what extent a complete set of jammer and emitter models can be use on the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) that are sponsored by U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM). 
4.5.	Methodologies, from which models can be verified, validated and accredited to support Operational Testing by COMOPTEVFOR.

5.	This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
 Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.

6.	Submissions will be considered up to and including SECRET.

<DESC><p>Amendment 0001 is&nbsp;expanded to post the questions and answers in a different format than as attached. All questions and answers are identical here as in the attachment. This is being posted&nbsp;by request due to the corruption of the attachment.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Questions and Answers<br />Federal Communications Commission <br />Office of the Managing Director<br />RFI: Measurement and Reporting of Mobile Broadband Performance and Coverage <br />10/08/2010 - 11/05/2010<br />RFI10082010BROADBAND Amendment 0001</p>
<p>Q 1. I have a question regarding the opportunity listed above. I was wondering if this is a new requirement? If not, could you please provide any information regarding a previous or current contractor that fulfilled the same or similar work?</p>
<p>If there is a previous or current contract, would you please provide the following information:<br />Contractor<br />Contract ID#<br />Contract Value<br />Award Date<br />Expiration date</p>
<p>A 1. Should the government move forward with this, it would be a new requirement.</p>
<p>Q 2. Is this inquiry related to mobile broadband via 3G cards only or does it include smartphone data access as well?</p>
<p>A 2. The inquiry is focused on the provisioning of mobile data services enabled by 3G and 4G network technologies (i.e., EVDO, HSPA, LTE,) delivered to any end-user devices (laptop cards, smartphones, etc.)</p>
<p>Q 3. Is there any file size suggestion for speed tests on smartphones? Is a file of 4 megabytes or less appropriate?</p>
<p>A 3. There is no suggested file size for speed tests on smartphones.</p>
<p>Q 4. Is measurement of coverage limited to data access or does it include voice signal strength/quality as well?</p>
<p>A 4. This RFI is focused on mobile broadband coverage, but the FCC recognizes mobile voice signals and coverage are typically available in the same areas where there is mobile broadband coverage.</p>
<p>Q 5. How important is measurement of signal strength?</p>
<p>A 5. Signal strength and signal quality are indicative of service availability in a given area. Signal strength is a metric that the FCC intends to consider with other complementary metrics, such as time of day, location and other performance metrics to understand actual performance and coverage in a given geographic area. Respondents should understand that the FCC is open to acquiring various types of data from different sources and respondents need not account for every metric mentioned in the RFI.</p>
<p><br />Q 6. How important is it to measure Wi-Fi on smartphones? Some reports show that 50% of traffic goes through a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>A 6. Wi-Fi performance is not intended to be measured as part of this FCC initiative. However, the FCC would consider proposals that include Wi-Fi performance information if the marginal cost is minimal.</p>
<p>Q 7. Can you offer any guidance on resolution of location? Is FCC looking for information at the DMA, county, or ZIP Code level, for example?</p>
<p>A 7. For analysis purposes-as granular as possible, but there are no required geographic units of measurement. The FCC believes latitude and longitude readings are the most granular and these readings are often aggregated to higher levels of geography for analytical purposes: such as census blocks, zip codes, and CMAs. In general, the FCC encourages respondents to set a level of aggregation that allows for maximal flexibility.</p>
<p>Q 8. Are there any sample size guidelines or requirements?</p>
<p>A 8. There are no sample size guidance or requirements at this time. The FCC hopes that any data collected or provided would be statistically significant.</p>
<p>Q 9. Should femtocells be excluded or included?</p>
<p>A 9. They shouldn't be strictly excluded or included, but any data collection would ideally be able to identify the type of connection so that femtocells could be included, excluded or accounted for through subsequent data analysis.</p>
<p>Q 10. Does the FCC have a view on project timing/completion in the event an RFP process is launched (i.e., within 12 months, by EOY 2011, etc.)?</p>
<p>A 10. There is not a strict timeline preference, but the FCC would ideally be able to start seeing relevant results within a few months after a contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Q 11. What specific mobile broadband performance metrics must be reported on?</p>
<p>A 11. There are no strict requirements. The FCC seeks data on mobile broadband performance, and the typical metrics are discussed in the RFI.</p>
<p>Q 12. Is hybrid satellite mobile broadband (MSS etc.) service to be included?</p>
<p>A 12. It would include the terrestrial mobile broadband component of a hybrid provision, but not the satellite component. However, if this is collectable at minimal marginal cost, the FCC may be interested in receiving this data.</p>
<p>Q 13. What is the lowest level of geographic unit of measurement that must be included and is data collection inclusive of 50 states, DC and all US possessions?</p>
<p>A 13. For analysis purposes-as granular as possible, but there are no required geographic units of measurement. The FCC believes latitude and longitude readings are the most granular and these readings are often aggregated to higher levels of geography for analytical purposes: such as census blocks, zip codes, and CMAs. In general, the FCC encourages respondents to set a level of aggregation that allows for maximal flexibility.</p>
<p>Q 14. What is the comprehensive list of consumer devices and underlying networks that the recommended solution must cover-e.g. cellular handsets, smartphones, Mobile Internet Devices, laptops, gaming consoles, other Internet enabled devices?</p>
<p>A 14. There is not a comprehensive list of consumer devices. The focus should be on the performance of the mobile broadband network itself and not the devices receiving the signal.</p>
<p>Q 15. What specific mapping and data visualization requirements and baseline reporting is required for the project, eg. Geo-location unit of measurement, frequency of reporting update, break-out by services type-voice, video, data; sub-services etc.)</p>
<p>A 15. There are no strict requirements beyond the high-level guidance in the RFI. The FCC would prefer a consumer friendly visualization of the data and a statistically significant and reliable reporting format that is meaningful to consumers and policymakers.</p>
<p>Q 16. Does the FCC anticipate this as a T&amp;M or FFP contract?</p>
<p>A 16. FFP.</p>

<DESC><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking qualified vendors for its Aviation Channeling Service Project (ACSP) to support the vetting of airport workers and aircraft operators. The estimated population is approximately 2,100,000. The anticipated geographic scope is the United States, and its possessions and territories. TSA is contemplating the establishment of Designated Aviation Channelers (DACs) based on the overall performance of each Offeror's technical solution for meeting TSA requirements. DACs will provide choice to airport and aircraft operators for channeling services for aviation populations. The Government plans to certify not more than three vendors on the basis of the most advantageous proposals. Responses shall be evaluated against the ACSP Solicitation, ACSP Technical Specification, and other identified information. The selection of DACs will be based on factors set forth by the Government. The selected DACs will be required to meet Federal system Certification and Accreditation requirements before providing services to regulated aviation stakeholders. Once selected, the DACs must support and maintain their technology solution during the qualification testing at no cost to the government, including but not limited to the design, development, maintenance, support, operations, etc. If the Offeror's system passes qualification testing and is deemed acceptable by the government, the Offeror would be placed on the TSA ACSP DAC List.</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Draft Technical Specification and Draft Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) is to allow end-users, interested vendors, etc., to review and comment on the draft technical requirements and the draft OTA contemplated for the Designated Aviation Channeling Services. The Government will keep the commentary period open for 7 days from posting to allow for the submission of comments or questions. The Government does not intend to respond to any of the questions or comments but will take these comments under advisement for possible changes if applicable to the Technical Specification or the OTA prior to the Government's issuance of the final solicitation.</p>
<p>Please direct comments and question about this upcoming requirement to GLORIA.URIA@DHS.GOV AND RENEE.GRACE@DHS.GOV within 7 days of this notice.</p>

<ARCHDATE>10092010
<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs	MEMORANDUM
Maryland Health Care System 
(VAMHCS)	Dated 9/28/2010
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION ON THE BASIS OF UNUSUAL & COMPELLING URGENCY

1.   CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  
a.   The Office of VISN 5 Contracting (BT 90/C) 
2.   ACTION BEING APPROVED:
a.   A justification is presented for the use of other than full and open competition on the basis of an unusual and compelling urgency that would seriously injure the Government unless permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.
3.   DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:  
a.   The VAMHCS Facilities and Engineering service has identified a need for a positive pressure fan vehicle emissions exhaust system at the Perry Point Fire Station BLDG 26. The system will be comprised of all equipment, material, parts and labor necessary to provide for the specified percentage of particulate and emissions removal. (See para.7a for estimated value)
4.   AUTHORITY:
a.   As prescribed in FAR 6.302-2 and in accordance with (IAW) statutory authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) "Competition requirements", the requested actions are permissible.
5.   JUSTIFICATIONS BEING PRESENTED:  
a.   Due to the nature of recent findings during an evaluation of the Perry Point fire station, the use of cited authority is required. In accordance with the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, as it pertains to diesel exhaust, NIOSH recommends that occupational exposure to carcinogens be limited to the lowest feasible concentration. The operation of a fire department requires the storage and indoor operation of fire apparatus that are generally housed in an enclosed building. The need to keep the apparatus and other vehicles ready for immediate service and in good operating condition, which requires the indoor running of vehicles for response and routine service/pump checks, makes storage in an enclosed area, such as an apparatus bay, necessary. 
b.   The exhaust from all internal combustion engines, including diesel and gasoline-powered engines, contains over 100 individual hazardous chemical components that, when combined, can result in as many as 10,000 chemical compounds. A large majority of these compounds are today listed by state and federal regulatory agencies as being cancer causing or suspected carcinogens. The target components listed by NIOSH/OSHA consist of both hydrocarbon carbon components and compounds, which are produced as both gas-phase and particulate-phase compounds. 
c.   The gases and particulates, which are viewed by NIOSH and OSHA as life threatening, consist of a cancer-causing substance known as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Gases in diesel exhaust, such as nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, benzene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, can also create health problems. According to NIOSH, human and animal studies show that diesel exhaust should be treated as a human carcinogen (cancer-causing substance). 

6.   ACTIONS TAKEN TO PROMOTE COMPETITION:
a.   IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2) for synopses of proposed contract actions exceptions, the contracting officer need not submit the notice required by FAR 5.201 when the contracting officer determines that the proposed contract action is made under conditions described in 6.302-2.
7.   FAIR & REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:
a.   The total anticipated cost to the Government of $45,691.00 is deemed fair and reasonable considering negotiated cost reductions in the amount of $12,309.00 less the original price of $58,000.
8.   DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH:
a.   IAW FAR Part 10, market research conducted by the VAMHCS Fire Department Service utilizing recommendations from VHA Center for Engineering & Occupational Safety and Health (CEOSH) revealed a compliance deficiency to be resolved specifically through the purchase of positive pressure fans in accordance with NFPA 1500.8.6.2*. 
0
There was no research conducted for this requirement because;
     


b.   IAW FAR Part 10, market research conducted by the Office of VISN 5 Contracting utilizing direct phone calls to listed GSA contractors revealed that sources who were found within the particular GSA schedule category did not provide the required product/service as stated in the requirement in accordance with CEOSH recommendations.
0
There was no research conducted for this requirement because;
     


9.   OTHER SUPPORTING FACTORS:
a.   IAW FAR 6.303-2 (a)(9)(iii), "When 6.302-2 is cited" the following data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government is presented;
NFPA 1500.9.1.6* states that the Fire Department shall prevent exposure to firefighters and contamination of living and sleeping areas to exhaust emissions. Compliance has been mandated and is required without delay due to the immediate health risk of exposure to known carcinogens. It is required that staff not be placed at further risk when such risks are known and that our actions be expediant in order to avoid the repercussions of our delay. 


10.   SOURCES HAVING EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, THEIR INTEREST:
a.   Due to the nature of this acquisition and IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2), this requirement was not synopsized and as such, there are no interested sources other than the proposed.
11.   ACTIONS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME COMPETITION BARRIERS:
a.   See paragraphs 6a and 8b above. Additionally, on future acquisitions of the same or similar requirements, fostering competition lies in the ability of the requesting service to foresee areas of continuous improvement; then inform and involve the Contracting Office in their yearly acquisition plan (IAW) FAR 7.102(a)(2) in order to obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable.
12.   REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:
a.   All supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.


/S/								9/28/2010
Darwin Benedict/Fire Chief		Date	
Contracting Officer Technical Representative, 

13.   APPROVALS:  
a.   Based on the justifications presented above I certify IAW 6.304(a)(1) "Justification approvals not exceeding $650,000", that the circumstances for restricting consideration to an item peculiar to one manufacture are; accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
