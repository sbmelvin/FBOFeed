<DESC>The 20th Contracting Squadron is seeking a qualified Architect-Engineer (A-E) Service contractor for award of one individual AE contract for design, alterations, repair and maintenance/study of two projects at Shaw AFB, SC. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330. THIS REQUIREMENT IF FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The required services shall include Title I Services (field surveys and investigations required to obtain design data, preparation of plans and specifications), Title II Services (supervision and inspection of construction, review of construction contractor submittals and shop drawings, preparation of as-built drawings) and Title III Services, which provide for the study or master planning of a project. These services are for a variety of projects that encompass various engineering disciplines, which will be identified in the attachment. It is estimated that this contract will be awarded on or about 1 September 2011. The selected contractor shall be awarded one firm fixed-price contract. A successful firm is expected to have significant capability to perform the contracted services using "in-house" personnel. Per Department of Defense policy, selection of the Engineering firm shall not be based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required.
<p>Contract Negotiations After Selection of the Most Qualified Firm: <br />IAW FAR 36.606(f), if a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer shall obtain a written final proposal revision from the firm, and notify the firm that negotiations have been terminated. The contracting officer shall then initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list. This procedure shall be continued until a mutually satisfactory contract has been negotiated. If negotiations fail with all selected firms, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the selection authority who, after consulting with the contracting officer as to why a contract cannot be negotiated, may direct the evaluation board to recommend additional firms in accordance with FAR 36.602.</p>
<p>Firms are reminded that FAR 36.601-3(a), requires that perspective architect-engineers specify, in the construction design specifications, use of the maximum practical amount of recovered materials consistent with the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. Where appropriate the engineer must consider energy conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction to the maximum extent practical. <br />EVALUATION and SELECTION CRITERIA: Submissions of completed Standard Forms 330 (SF-330) received in response to this notice will be evaluated by a government selection board in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks Act) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firm. Recent (within the past 5 years), relevant performance in preparing projects valued between $100,000 and $1,000,000 may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified. The primary factor for selection shall be the most qualified firm. The following is a detailed list of evaluation criteria. <br />(1) Professional Qualifications: Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance as demonstrated by education, experience, registration and management ability of personnel assigned to this contract and any applicable outside consultants. Availability of experienced key personnel, and consultants, and the number of years the consultants have worked with the firm.</p>
<p>(2) Specialized Experience: Technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials; specialized experience and technical competence of the team proposed for this project (including outside consultants) in related design areas of renovation, alteration, upgrading and repair of commercial, industrial and housing facilities. The effectiveness of the proposed project team (management structure and coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors) is also considered.</p>
<p>(3) Capacity: The firm's available capacity of key disciplines and experience with similar size projects is evaluated. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.</p>
<p>(4) Past Performance: Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. References and letters of commendation are also evaluated. List previous contracts and include the name and telephone number of the person who was the point of contact representing the Government or private industry contact. Government databases shall also be used.</p>
<p>(5) Location: Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; a 100-mile radius to Shaw Air Force Base located in Sumter, South Carolina is preferred. In selecting the most qualified firm, greater significance shall not be attributed to location.</p>
<p>(6) Prior Work Experience: Prior work experience to include contracts performed for city government, state government, federal agencies and Shaw AFB if applicable.</p>
<p>(7) CAD and Internet Capability: The firm's ability to produce engineering drawings on a CADD system and provide drawings to Shaw AFB that are fully compatible with Autodesk's AutoCAD computer assisted design and drafting software, version 2009 (or later).</p>
<p>(8) Cost Control Effectiveness: Demonstrate knowledge of design approaches, construction materials, codes/ordinances, costs, and other conditions unique to the geographic area covered by this contract. This includes evaluation of a firm's ability to accurately project construction costs of project designs within established cost parameters.</p>
<p>(9). Design Capability: This includes evaluation of a firm's description of their quality control processes and a description of the management approach the firm would use on the contract if they were the successful offeror.<br />(10). Volume of Work: The firm's available capacity to handle work. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.<br />A-E firms, which meet the requirements described in this announcement, are invited to submit completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualification (required for this project). All information relating to the firms qualifications must be contained in the Standard Form. Inclusion by reference to other materials is not acceptable.

Respond by submitting two (2) copies of SF 330 which must be received no later than 4:30 PM EST, 11 May 2011. Firms desiring consideration shall submit appropriate data as described in this notice.

A six month contract extension is needed to allow the Government sufficient time to award a follow-on RTS MED contract on a competitive basis and to allow for the necessary phase in period for the new contract. The three one-month option periods will only be used to protect against any unexpected delays in the award of the new contract. <br><br>RTS MED requirements include Medical Readiness Training and Maintenance Services at Camp Parks, California, Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, Fort Gordon, Georgia and other satellite sites. The current contract will expire on 30 September 2011.  The proposed extension periods-of-performance are 01 Oct 2011-31 Mar 2012 to include three (3) one-month option periods beginning on 01 Apr 2012-30 Jun 2012, if required.<br><br>The proposed contract extension will be awarded on a sole source because the size and complexity of the requirement necessitate a phase in period for the inventory of equipment and materials.  The incumbent contractor, Lockheed-Martin Electronic Systems, is the only source capable of beginning performance immediately to meet the Government's needs without a significant and unallowable break in service. Additionally, the investment associated with a requirement of this size and nature cannot be recouped by a new contractor within the short performance time allotted for the proposed contract extension.  <br><br>This proposed contractual action will be made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)(B), Only One Responsible Source Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, however, responsible sources who submit a timely capability statement or proposal will be considered by the Agency. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  The closing date for this synopsis is 21 April 2011 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date of this extension is no later than 15 September 2011. For information regarding this purchase, please contact MAJ James Mote at (609) 562-5098 or via email at james.mote@conus.army.mil.

A determination by the government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Interested sources may respond by submitting their company's qualifications/capabilities by 14 April 2011, 11:00 AM EST to Contract Specialist Paul Holbert via email paul.holbert@dla.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND), a branch of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) to negotiate/award a purchase order to DJK Scientific Inc., 939 AEC Drive, Wood Dale, IL, 60191, for the purchase of Wako Hornet NX Pintool dispenser pins. <br /><br />The Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), is requesting dispenser pins that are compatible with the DJK Pintool instrument. The pins are needed to perform assays in 1536 well format. Running assays in 1536 well plates translates to a very small volume; 5-10 micro liter range. One of the biggest obstacles in working with such small volumes is the ability to transfer even smaller volumes of compound/drug; 20-50 nano liter range. These pins are designed to accurately transfer such small volumes. Furthermore, a rigorous wash cycle is implemented with these pins to reduce the amount of compound/drug carry over from one plate to the next. These are compatible with the reagents used in this rigorous wash cycle that is currently used on a daily bases at the NCTT. Substantial effort has gone into determining the appropriate pintool for compound/drug transfer into 1536 well pates, and these originally provided pins are the only option currently available on the market that meets NCTT's requirements. <br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that this identical technology is needed to reproduce performance and protocol transfer between the laboratories within the NCTT. This additional unit will improve data consistency and quality, enabling a seamless transition of assays from the bench to the full automation between the laboratories of the NCTT. In order to maximize the technology available to NCTT staff, this additional unit will enable&nbsp;NCTT to replicate and duplicate existing protocols and will allow NCTT the flexibility to use the exact same technology for all protocols. Using this same technology will eliminate the introduction of costly new variables into the data and this factor will result in huge cost savings to&nbsp;the center in terms of man hours and consumables costs.
<p><br />Product Description:<br /><br />1. Qty.-1800, FP1CS 10 PINS, 10 nL pins, 0.457 mm diameter, 33 mm length<br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-50, March 16, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 423840 and the Size Standard is 100 Employees.

<DESC>TITLE: RESEARCH VESSEL TRIPS FOR OBSERVER TRAINING
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the Beaufort Laboratory for research vessel charter services. Both recently enacted and pending management actions by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council will result in considerable reductions in availability of fishery-dependent data for many fish species in the snapper-grouper complex, resulting in an increased need for the fishery-independent (FI) data. As a result, the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center initiated FI survey efforts in FY10. The goal of this work is to collect FI data on reef fish resources in the U.S. South Atlantic region. Cruise operations in 2011-2015 will range from 20-75 days at-sea and will support the following at-sea tasks: Stationary camera surveys of reef fish resources; Collect reef fish using chevron fish traps; Conduct total water column CTD profiles; Collect and process fish samples for transport to on-shore laboratories (wet lab operations); and At-sea data entry (dry lab operations).<br /><br />Scope:<br />The Contractor shall provide charter services of a research vessel for multiple cruises totaling 20-75 days at-sea in southeast US continental shelf waters, with a focus on areas offshore of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The charter will include accommodation and food for a party of up to 18 scientific personnel. The cruises will involve intensive gear deployment (e.g., traps, cameras, longlines, CTD) and retrieval.</p>
<p>At-sea operations will involve visiting up to 24 discrete sites per day, requiring vessel idling for gear deployment (traps, cameras, longlines and CTD) and retrieval during daylight hours and potentially at night. Stations depths are expected to range from 15-120m. Contractor will be required to assist with gear deployment and retrieval (e.g., crane and pot hauler operations). Scientific personnel will operate 24 hours a day (two shifts working 6-hrs-on, 6-hrs-off, or 12-hrs-on, 12 hrs-off schedules), with sample processing and data entry occurring predominantly at night within ship laboratory spaces.</p>
<p>Aside from gear deployment and retrieval, cruising speed operation during daylight hours are estimated at (&lt; 4 hrs) and night hours (&lt;12 hrs) for transit between sampling sites.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted competitive solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 483114 Coastal and Great Lakes Passenger Transportation. The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors listed in descending order of importance 1 - 3, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Vessel Capacity and Characteristics; (2) Operational Equipment; (3) Master's and crew's Resume; and (4) Price. All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must obtain a DUNS number (this may be done by calling 1-800-333-0505) and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. . The solicitation will be available electronically on or about April 11, 2011 via FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov.

A minimum of two proposals per task order will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either a tradeoff or low-price technically acceptable basis.  If the Government decides to utilize the tradeoff process, evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements of each task order.
  If the low price, technically acceptable method is used, the lowest price proposed that is technically acceptable will receive the task order award.  

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for the Mini-MACC through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and is available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.  

Offers will not be publicly opened.
  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov. Reference is made to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  You are encouraged to register as soon as possible.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The purpose is for SAMHSA/CSAT to continue to provide support for an education campaign to alert the public about the dangers of inhalants. The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition will hold a press conference in Washington to kick-off National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week in March 2012 and to stimulate media coverage of the dangers of inhalant use and abuse. Task 1: Collect and highlight no less than five (5) new individual/family survival or Recovery stories linked to the treatment or prevention of inhalant abuse and feature them on the NIPC website. Task 2: Develop three (3) web-based UPDATES of educational materials targeting various potential consumer groups such as parents, youth and educators about the inhalant dangers and treatment. Task 3: Conduct a literature search and identify all new academic and NIH-sponsored research, new findings, materials and brochures and develop one (1) article that can be included in the NIPC web page to inform children, families and constituents who visit the NIPC website. Establish links to all new sites from the NIPC site. Task 4: Plan and complete all preparation and required logistics, in partnership with SAMHSA/CSAT, for the March 2012 press conference to kick off the eighteenth annual NIPAW events. Task 5: Provide SAMHSA/CSAT/Consumer Affairs with NIPC letter and no less than 1000 mailing labels to partner with the dissemination of Recovery Month materials. The letter and mailing labels need to be sent to SAMHSA/CSAT by March 31, 2012.

Task 6: Prepare a final report, due April 30, 2012, including all program information such as planning, goals, activities, and materials developed. The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) is a public-private effort to promote awareness and recognition of the under-publicized problem of inhalant use and its deadly consequences. NIPC is the only organization of its type with the contacts, know-how and dedication to combating inhalant abuse necessary to bring this project to fruition. The proposed Simplified Acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice. A determination by the government not to complete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available.

<DESC>The primary goal of the project is to create woody riparian habitat along the Lower Snake River. Skookum HMU is located in Lower Monumental Pool on the right bank at river mile 47-50. The HMU has an existing irrigation system which includes an in-river intake/pump with irrigation pipes. The project would expand the existing system by constructing a new system upstream between the cattle corridors. After the irrigation is expanded, the site would be planted with shrubs and trees in separate contract.<br>The conceptual layout is to irrigate 5 swales along the river between the cattle corridors. The length is approximately 3,800 feet and up to 300' up slope from the river. The project will provide an estimated 40 acres of riparian and 75 acres of shrub steppe habitat. <br><br>The contractor will be responsible for replacing the existing diesel pump with a new electric pump and connecting the pump to the new electrical service. Electrical power will be brought across the river and near to the site in a separate contract. The amount and type of work for the power hook up is partially subject to where the electrical lines cross the river and where the sprinklers are to be placed.<br><br>The existing intake is in the process of being inspected to determine if the contractor will be required to repair or replace it. <br><br>Contractor access would be from the river. All material, equipment and labor would be brought in by barge. It is assumed that there will be minimal effort in preparing the shore for river access. <br><br>The estimated quantities below are for installing the new irrigation system. These estimates are for informational purposes only. The contractor will be responsible for verifying quantities in the solicitation package. The backfill quantity is a conservative estimate in that this assumes all backfill and bedding material will be imported to the site and that any excess excavated material will not be removed from the site but be wasted on site. An evaluation is underway to determine if the existing materials are suitable for bedding. It is very possible that some of the excavated material will be used as backfill.<br><br>It is assumed that access to the existing inlet for removal and replacement can be accomplished from the shore. An excavator could be used to lift the old inlet and to place the new inlet. Depending on the distance from the shore and the current depth of the inlet, a working barge may be required and possibly even divers. The new inlet is assumed at this point to be similar to the T1000 inlet from Pump-Rite Screens (www.pump-rite.com) or equal.<br><br>Quantities<br><br>Length (ft) Excavation (BCY) Pipe (LF) Backfill (LCY)<br>2.5" Pipe 4,800 ft. 1,200 BCY 4,800 LF 1,440 LCY<br>4" Pipe 1,110 ft. 278 BCY 1,110 LF 333 LCY<br>6" Pipe 1,111 ft. 356 BCY 1,111 LF 444 LCY<br>8" Pipe 1,824 ft. 803 BCY 1,824 LF 1,003 LCY<br>10" Pipe 520 ft. 229 BCY 520 LF 286 LCY<br>Total 2,864 BCY 9,365 LF 3,507 LCY<br><br><br>Excavation (BCY) Gravel Base (CY) Concrete (CY) <br>Pump Pad 3.0 BCY 1.5 CY 1.2 CY <br><br>Typical equipment that will be used on-site will be a small backhoe for excavation, a small front-end loader for unloading and hauling material, and a walk-behind compactor.<br><br>

PLACE OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE:  The U.S. is defined as the 50 States, Territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  The service provider must be able to provide all services with the same service level within all geographic locations.

 SET-ASIDE STATUS:   N/A
SUMMARY:
The Construction and Valuation Section (C&V) of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) is responsible for the quality of appraisal reports on properties offered as security for VA guaranteed loans.  
In 2002, VA completed a nationwide initiative that consolidated 46 Regional Offices with loan guaranty operations to nine (9) Regional Loan Centers (RLCs).  This allowed some efficiencies, however, as VA moves forward, it is essential that proven technological advances be taken advantage of in order to improve resource management and to continue providing quality benefits to our nation's veterans, in a more cost efficient manner.
The purpose of this Solicitation is to support the procurement of Appraisal Management Services (AMS) and Automated Valuation Management (AVM) services to further enhance the appraisal review process, thereby improving the oversight functions of Construction and Valuation Section(C&V).  C&V's vision is to provide a phased approach to accomplish a fully integrated, seamless, and user-friendly solution encompassing appraisal requests through the issuance of a VA guaranty.  The Contractor shall provide the C&V staff, lenders, and servicers in the United States (U.S.) with services that will improve standardization, performance, and quality of appraisal reviews.  This acquisition effort will result in the award of a purchase of service from an independent contractor.  
Currently, VA employees perform post closing quality reviews on approximately 165,000 randomly sampled appraisal reports annually.  Instead of random sampling, VA will begin to target reviews based upon the scored appraisal.  Risk-based scoring will enable VA to perform enhanced analysis on those appraisals targeted by the AMS model.
The following Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) objectives are listed in descending priority:
1.	Improve the quality of individual appraisal reports.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized metrics for appraisals
b.	Identify global systemic quality issues
c.	Contribute to the development and refinement of role-specific training curriculum
2.	Improve the quality of individual appraiser performance.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized metrics for individual appraisers
b.	Identify appraiser-specific quality issues and deficiencies
c.	Contribute to appraiser-specific remediation plans, including identifying competency gaps requiring training
3.	Streamline, standardize, and approve the appraisal review process.
a.	Continuously enhance available data, product features, integration, process/service design, and usability 
b.	Leverage existing resources to perform more detailed oversight 
c.	Improve the quality and consistency of the appraisal review process
d.	Reduce the time and cost associated with processing an individual appraisal review
4.	Decrease risk to LGY.
a.	Reduce risk of fraudulent/invalid valuations
A proven and previously fielded Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product is required.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. 
The Government intends to make one award as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contract (ID/IQ) will have a five (5) year period of performance. The solicitation will be issued on or about April 11, 2011 with an anticipated closing date on or about May 18, 2011.

<DESC><p>PBGC: Financial Advisory Services Support: Transactions<br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>The PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires the services of financial advisory firms to support DISC in transactions involving pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members. The overall goal of the procurement is to provide PBGC with the following:</p>
<p>1. A reasonably-priced, flexible contract to acquire commercial financial advisory services.<br /><br />2. High-quality financial advisory services.<br /><br />3. The ability to issue task orders and begin work on those task orders in a very short time frame. <br /><br />4. Access to financial advisory services during a base year and four option years (for a maximum of five possible years).</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback from interested firms as to the various pricing structures used in the financial advisory community.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC currently has multiple-award-schedule, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQ) with seven firms to provide financial advisory services to DISC. Those contracts currently expire on 30 September 2011. Going forward, PBGC is considering replacing those contracts with two sets of IDIQ contracts, one for services in support of bankruptcy &amp; restructuring activities and one in support of transactions. These contracts will be task order contracts, meaning that the firms selected for the new IDIQ contracts will then compete for awards of specific task orders whenever DISC determines it needs outside financial advisory services. Both sets of contracts are likely to be performance based, and will possibly provide incentives for selected firms to obtain certain results in either the bankruptcy/restructuring activities or the transactions. The same firms will be eligible to compete and receive awards for both the Bankruptcy/Restructuring and Transaction Support IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p><br />Proposed Structure: Transaction Support<br /><br />The IDIQ contracts PBGC proposes to award will contain general requirements that each firm must be prepared to meet. Specific activities that the firms will have to undertake for each transaction will be set out in each task order. Because each transaction is unique, it is difficult to state in advance and with particularity what deliverable items the selected firm would have to provide in each task order. Thus a pricing arrangement providing for payment by deliverable item is probably not practical. Additionally, transactions are typically fixed in time and relatively short in duration, so PBGC is considering a flat rate for the entire transaction. PBGC is also considering ways in which to provide a monetary incentive arrangement based on targets that the firm would strive to meet.</p>
<p>Request</p>
<p>PBGC is aware that financial advisory firms use a variety of pricing structures in commercial activities and that those structures differ according to the types of firms involved (e.g., investment banks, financial consulting firms, and accounting firms). PBGC therefore requests that interested firms review the attached proposed Performance Work Statement for transactions and provide PBGC with feedback. Specifically, we would like to know (1) whether your firm would be interested in bidding on a contract for these services; (2) what types of pricing structures you have seen and used in similar situations; and (3) what ideas you have as to how PBGC might best structure the pricing component its procurement for transactional support (See attached Draft Request for Proposal).</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>Send your responses to Fiorela Kvalevog, contracts specialist, at Kvalevog.fiorela@pbgc.gov. We ask that you submit your responses no later than 2:00pmEaster Standard Time on April 18, 2011.</p>
<p><br />Disclaimer and Important Information</p>
<p>This Request for Information is for informational purposes only. Please be aware that any information posted to this notice is only a draft version.</p>
<p>The official solicitation and any amendments will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 6, 2011. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO website to ensure that the most up to date information is accessed. Paper copies of the solicitation and any amendments will not be distributed. Upon issuance of the solicitation, there will be an identified question and answer period.</p>
<p>Further inquiries regarding this solicitation must be sent to Fiorela Kvalevog, Contract Specialist at kvalevog.fiorela@pbgc.gov.</p>
<p>The anticipated IDIQ contract has a period of performance of a base period of twelve (12) months and Four (4) option periods consisting of twelve (12) months each. In order to be eligible for award, all responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Contractors may register online at the website, www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>PBGC: Financial Advisory Services Support: Bankruptcy &amp; Restructuring Support<br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>The PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires the services of financial advisory firms to support DISC in complex bankruptcy and restructuring cases involving pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members. The overall goal of the procurement is to provide PBGC with the following:</p>
<p>1. A reasonably-priced, flexible contract to acquire commercial financial advisory services.<br /><br />2. High-quality financial advisory services.<br /><br />3. The ability to issue task orders and begin work on those task orders in a very short time frame. <br /><br />4. Access to financial advisory services during a base year and four option years (for a maximum of five possible years).</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback from interested firms as to the various pricing structures used in the financial advisory community.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC currently has multiple-award-schedule, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQ) with seven firms to provide financial advisory services to DISC. Those contracts currently expire on 30 September 2011. Going forward, PBGC is considering replacing those contracts with two sets of IDIQ contracts, one for services in support of bankruptcy &amp; restructuring activities and one in support of transactions. These contracts will be task order contracts, meaning that the firms selected for the new IDIQ contracts will then compete for awards of specific task orders whenever DISC determines it needs outside financial advisory services. Both sets of contracts are likely to be performance based, and will possibly provide incentives for selected firms to obtain certain results in either the bankruptcy/restructuring activities or the transactions. The same firms will be eligible to compete and receive awards for both the Bankruptcy/Restructuring and Transaction Support IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>Proposed Structure: Bankruptcy &amp; Restructuring</p>
<p>The IDIQ contracts PBGC proposes to award will contain general requirements that each firm must be prepared to meet. Specific activities that the firms will have to undertake for each bankruptcy/restructuring will be set out in each task order. Because each bankruptcy/restructuring activity is unique, it is difficult to state in advance and with particularity what deliverable items the selected firm would have to provide in each task order. Thus a pricing arrangement providing for payment by deliverable item is probably not practical. Additionally, bankruptcy and restructuring activities tend to be somewhat open-ended in time, so PBGC is considering a pricing structure in which periodic payments would be made to the selected firm to provide for cash flow. PBGC is also considering ways in which to provide a monetary incentive arrangement based on targets that the firm would strive to meet.</p>
<p><br />Request</p>
<p>PBGC is aware that financial advisory firms use a variety of pricing structures in commercial activities and that those structures differ according to the types of firms involved (e.g., investment banks, financial consulting firms, and accounting firms). PBGC therefore requests that interested firms review the attached proposed Performance Work Statements for bankruptcy/restructuring services and provide PBGC with feedback. Specifically, we would like to know (1) whether your firm would be interested in bidding on a contract for these services; (2) what types of pricing structures you have seen and used in similar situations; and (3) what ideas you have as to how PBGC might best structure the pricing component its procurement for bankruptcy/restructuring and transactional support.</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt">Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability. This Source Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposals and at this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.</span></strong> Introduction: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DELL Laptops, Tablet &amp; Associated Peripherals&nbsp;</strong></span>specified on the attached Spec List. (Please see attachment) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;The intent of&nbsp;DTRA agency is to place this requirement </span>through commercial Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) single&nbsp;contract award&nbsp;with a period of performance&nbsp;of approximately 3-yrs. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Background: DTRA is a DoD component that recognizes the&nbsp;essential benefits of a reasonable replacement life cycle for commercial laptops&nbsp;and its associated peripherals. Within this framework, the&nbsp;end-user's computing needs both current and future can be upgraded&nbsp;in a reasonable amount of time while reducing security risks through acquistion of&nbsp;new technology advancements. Henceforth, the objective of the future solicitation is to acquire Dell Laptops,&nbsp;Tablet &amp;&nbsp;Associated Peripherals specified in the spec list with the minimum flexibility requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The flexibility on the IDIQ requirements must meet the following minimum requirements: 1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL UPDATES</strong></span> for all items - are desired as technology for the same form, fit, and function.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If an item has a replacement available (technology refresh) notify the DTRA agency of the refresh, as the new item should generally be specified and provided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LIFE CYCLE</strong></span> time until end-of-life for sales must be greater than 9 months for items below, if this condition is not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>met, a technology refresh replacement must be offered in lieu of the item specified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUPPORT</span></strong> - all items must be supportable for 3 years from the date of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO SUBSTITUTION</strong></span> - except for technology refresh and unless noted otherwise. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The DELL &amp; other associated peripheral brand names were selected because there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by&nbsp;unique capabilities in providing interoperability with existing laptop computer infrastructure and most importantly cost effectiveness in regards to minimizing migrating compatibility issues. The agency anticipates this requirement to be Firm-Fixed Price contract and will be solicited as Other-Than-Full Open Competition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Responses: Interested offerors should address in their written response whether they can fulfill this requirement via a GSA schedule, NASA SEWP, NIH, or open market. Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status (such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned).

Market research involves obtaining information specific to the item being acquired and should include- <br />(i) Whether the Government's needs could be met by- <br />(A) Items of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; <br />(B) Items of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace with modifications; or <br />(C) Items used exclusively for governmental purposes; <br />(ii) Customary practices regarding customizing, modifying or tailoring of items to meet customer needs and associated costs; <br />(iii) Customary practices, including warranty, buyer financing, discounts, contract type considering the nature and risk associated with the requirement, etc., under which commercial sales of the products or services are made; <br />(iv) The requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the item being acquired; <br />(v) The availability of items that contain recovered materials and items that are energy efficient; <br />(vi) The distribution and support capabilities of potential suppliers, including alternative arrangements and cost estimates; and <br />(vii) Size and status of potential sources.</p>
<p>Mission and Objectives:</p>
<p>The evaluation of this instrument will provide DPA with superior abilities for screening of API's, drug products, generic compounds or herbal supplements to identify the presence of designer drugs, impurities, excipients or adulterants (e.g., steroids, amphetamines and erectile dysfunction drugs). This instrument will also enhance the Division's efforts in the study of drug delivery or drug-metabolism-pharmacokinetic (DMPK) for novel drug delivery products (e.g., transdermal drug delivery devices). The requested instrument will improve our analytical capabilities (qualitative and, more importantly, quantitative) for any project requiring high sensitivity, trace analysis in complex matrices such as body fluids (blood, plasma or urine), natural products, etc.</p>
<p>The objectives of the FDA in requesting this equipment is part of an overall system that will allow for molecular characterization of protein therapeutics, analysis and discovery of biomarkers, and facilitate PK/PD as well as toxicology studies that are ongoing in DPA and DAPR/CLP.</p>
<p>The QQQ mass spectrometers require a stable nitrogen source for spray gas in the ESI source. This spray gas runs continually thus the cost of demurrage for high pressure liquid N2 tanks and their refilling becomes prohibitive. In addition the DPA labs are not equipped for delivery of the large high pressure N2 tanks. Therefore, the QQQ manufacturer recommends the use of an N2 generator with compressor to supply a stable high purity (&gt;99.5%) nitrogen gas source from air for the mass spectrometers as the most cost effective way to supply the instrument with the needed gas.</p>

USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROPOSAL INFORMATION -- DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR (APR 1984)
(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:
(1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities.
(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells."
(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend:
"The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."
(c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:
"This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal."
(d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.
(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.
(f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.

5.4	Cloud Computing & Records Management (5 pages)Please address the following NARA concerns related to cloud technologies and records management.
1.	Cloud applications may lack the capability to implement records disposition schedules, including the ability to transfer and permanently delete records or perform other records management functions. Therefore specific service and deployment models may not meet all of the records management requirements of 36 CFR Part 1236 (formerly 36 CFR part 1234). Examples of these requirements include: a.	Maintaining records in a way that maintains their functionality and integrity throughout the records' full lifecycleb.	Maintaining links between the records and their metadatac.	Transfer of archival records to NARA or deletion of temporary records according to NARA-approved retention schedules.2.	Depending on the application, cloud service providers must be made aware of the record retention requirements governing a given body of Federal records stored in one or more cloud locations. Agencies need to be able to control any proposed deletion of records pursuant to existing authorities, wherever the records may be located in the providers' cloud. Cloud service providers must also act to ensure that records are accessible so as to ensure agency responsiveness to discovery, or FOIA/Privacy Act, or other access requests.3.	Various cloud architectures lack formal technical standards governing how data are stored and manipulated in cloud environments. This threatens the long-term trustworthiness and sustainability of the data.4.	A lack of portability standards may result in difficulty removing records for recordkeeping requirements or complicate the transition to another environment. This could affect the ability of agencies to meet their recordkeeping responsibilities for temporary or historically valuable records being transferred to NARA.5.	Agencies and cloud service providers should anticipate how continued preservation and access issues will be resolved in a contingency where the cloud service provider's business operations materially change (e.g., bankruptcy), or cease altogether.
5.5	Published Price (3 pages)Respondents are encouraged to provide relevant GSA or related Federal Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) and/or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts available for your product / solution
6	Contemplated Type of ContractIf this results in a solicitation the Government intends to competitively award a period of performance of two years, plus three one-year option periods. The type of award is not yet determined.
7	Point of ContactPlease direct questions related to this response to Kelson Baker Kelson.Baker@aqd.nbc.gov.  Phone calls will not be accepted or responded to.

Examples of some of the types include research laboratory remodels, small warehouse design, office remodels to improve energy usage and safety, design of renewable energy systems, design of high efficiency replacement HVAC systems, design of electrical systems, lighting, water and waste water systems, drafting services, surveying, geotechnical investigation and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA) reviews.<br />From time to time, when projects come up that are estimated to cost less than $1,000,000, Battelle may review the current AE qualification packages on file to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms and have discussions with those 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for a particular project. A price proposal will be requested from the highest rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm and so on. <br />Key factors that have been determined to have a high value in descending order of importance for any actions awarded as a result of this call for qualifications are:
<p>o Design Ability &amp; Excellence.<br />o Capacity and Capability.<br />o Professional Qualifications.<br />o Past performance.<br />o Geographic location of home office and familiarity of the locality.</p>
<p>Note: Capacity and Capability are approximately equal in weight with Professional Qualifications, and only slightly less important than Design Ability and Excellence; with location of the home office and familiarity of the locality significantly less importance. Past Performance will be evaluated separately from the other criteria, to determine the degree of risk involved in accepting an offeror's promises of performance.</p>
<p>In order for a firm to be eligible and receive consideration for future AE projects you must submit one copy of each of the following documents: <br />o Central Contractor Registration</p>

<p>&#9632; The SF 330 Part II, General Qualifications, provides basic information about the capabilities and experience of a firm and is not specific to a contract. A Part II is required for the prime firm and each subcontractor, and is prepared on a branch office basis. It includes the type of ownership, small business type (if applicable), point of contact, number of personnel in each discipline, profile of the firm's experience, and annual volume of work.</p>

<p>a) What is your concept/approach?</p>
<p>b) What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</p>
<p>c) What are the risks and the payoffs?</p>
<p>d) How much will it cost?</p>
<p>e) How long will it take?</p>
<p>f) What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has exercised the option to extend the contract with Public Safety Technoligies (PST), Inc. for an annual maintenance agreement for 1 each, Server and 50 each, RADCOM Clients.  THIS IS ACTUALLY A SPECIAL NOTICE, NOT A SOURCES SOUGHT.  Contract is effective April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.  This is a Limited Remote Management Agreement which includes only remote dial-in management assistance during normal business hours.  PST is the only contractor authorized to make changes to RADCOM software.  PST is the inventor and owner of the RADCOM mobile software product currently deployed throughout CDD LE, and Public Safety staff.  The RADCOM software application is commercially proprietary and no other private or commercial vendor has access to the RADCOM software's source cod held by PST.  Any changes made to the RADCOM server or software by unauthorized personnel would void the existing product warranties.  The use of other law enforcement dispatching applications or mobile products would constitute  a total redesign of both software and hardware components presently in place with California Desert District (CDD) and its Federal Interagency Communications (FICC)  partners.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for Full Disk Encryption Method for Commercial Mobile Devices
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-11-34
<RESPDATE>050211
<CONTACT>Brian Eshenbrenner, Director Security and Intelligence, Email DARPA-SN-11-34@darpa.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). DARPA, within the guidelines described in its charter, wishes to support research to assist the Department of Defense and the Federal Government in addressing the cross-agency challenges associated with securing proprietary data stored in commercial mobile devices (CMDs). The primary purpose of this RFI is to discover new technologies and methods to support full disk and system encryption of the CMDs (specifically Apple and Android platforms) to include a pre-boot environment to load the operating system. The solution must use an AES-256 bit encryption algorithm compliant with FIPS 140-2 as published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In order to meet this objective, DARPA extends an invitation to industry and universities to submit a whitepaper with ideas/concepts that describe an innovative existing technology approach that can be deployed in less than 90 days. The whitepaper should include a brief summary of the company/team including prior work, and the team's ability to support this work; an overview of the new technology or innovative existing technology approach; and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) on the cost to implement this approach. White paper format will be a one page cover sheet that identifies the contact information including the title, organization, responder's points of contact (names, addresses, phone number, and email addresses); Microsoft PowerPoint slides, not to exceed five slides, summarizing key aspects of the response; and Microsoft Word or PDF file, 12-point font, not to exceed five pages, describing the response. This is an RFI issued solely for information gathering purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or abstracts. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. Submission of a white paper is not required to propose to Broad Agency Announcements or research announcements on this topic. No classified information should be included in the RFI response. Respondents are advised that DARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Responses to this RFI do not bind DARPA to any further actions related to this topic including requesting follow-on proposals from vendors responding to this RFI. White paper submissions containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. It is the proposer's responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered proprietary data. Responses to this RFI should be submitted electronically to Mr. Brian Eshenbrenner, Director of&nbsp;Security and Intelligence, DARPA-SN-11-34@darpa.mil . Any inquiries on this RFI must be submitted to this email. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All RFI responses should be received no later than 7:00am EST, 2 May 2011.

<SUBJECT>Deployed Energy Storage Program Proposers' Day
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-11-35
<RESPDATE>042211
<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-11-53@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE: DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of the BAA 11-53, Deployed Energy Storage (DES) program on April 27, 2011 at The Hilton Hotel, 950 N. Stafford St., Arlington, VA from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Deployed Energy Storage (DES) program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The goal of the DES program is to develop a system that can be deployed to forward operating bases (FOBs) that will store and distribute power from traditional and renewable power sources to provide the user with an uninterrupted reserve energy supply with millisecond to multiple day power interruptions or extended periods of reduced availability of energy supply. Such a capability will minimize the amount of fuel needed for power generation at FOBs. <br /><br />A technology solution to the DES uninterruptible power challenge must be capable of responding to power fluctuations that span from short-term (milliseconds to hours) to long-term (hours to days) durations. For example, using photovoltaics for power generation, a short-term interruption could be caused by a cloud passing in front of the sun, a medium term interruption would be caused by the sun setting, and longer term power interruption could be caused by a multiday storm or seasonal event. Available wind power manifests power fluctuations of similar timescales. <br /><br />The envisioned system will be comprised of three functionalities: short-term energy storage, long-term energy storage, and system integration of the storage technology<br />with microgrid technology. These three functionalities must be integrated to allow intelligent load sharing between multiple storage and generation technologies to enable efficient storage, use, and distribution of power. The system at full charge will be capable of providing uninterrupted power to a 150 kW average load for 9 days with 90% reduction and 30 days with a 30% reduction in available generated power from an appropriately sized renewable power generation plant.<br /><br />At the completion of the program a 100-150 kW (average load) system will be continuously demonstrated for 30 days at a government facility using renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Additional parameters will be listed in BAA 11-53 and will be discussed at the Proposers' Day Conference.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT 4:00 p.m. EDT, April 22, 2011, by requesting a Proposers' Day registration form from BAA Administrators at the following email address: DARPA-BAA-11-53@DARPA.MIL, with the subject line: Proposers Day Information. Directions to the facility and other materials are also available upon request. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization. The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public. All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event. Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference. Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request". The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to: BAA Administration, fax 703-516-8791, no later than 4:00pm EDT, April 22, 2011. Both forms are available at the end of this announcement.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so. Presentations may contain 2 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues). Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact BAA Administrators at: DARPA-BAA-11-53@DARPA.MIL as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers' Day Conference.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance. An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to DARPA-BAA-11-53@DARPA.MIL for review by 4:00pm EDT, April 22, 2011. There will be no exceptions to this requirement.</p>
<p>After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with Dr. Robert Mantz. Please contact BAA Administrators at: DARPA-BAA-11-53@DARPA.MIL to schedule an individual session.</p>

<DESC>ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
VA PALO ALTO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAPITAL ASSET IMPROVEMENTS

The Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) located in Washington, DC is conducting a survey regarding inclusion of an Economic Price Adjustments (EPA) clause for steel products for VA-101-11-RP-0073; Project Number is 640-424, VA Palo Alto Health Care System Capital Asset Improvements, Palo Alto, CA 94304. The EPA questionnaire is below. Please complete and return to me the EPA questionnaire within seven (7) days from the posting date of this announcement.  

The VA Palo Alto Health Care System project capital asset improvements project will consist of the construction of a three-story, approximately 174,000 GSF Polytrauma/Blind Rehabilitation Center and associated site utilities; the demolition of approximately 64,000 GSF of seismic exceptionally high risk two-story Building 48 and two-story Building 2 Wing C and associated site utilities; and the construction of a four-story, approximately 210,000 GSF, cast-in-place, 600-Car Parking Structure.  

Note: EPA type examples: Adjustments based on established prices, actual cost, or cost indexes.

1)Is your company familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause for Economic Price Adjustments (EPA) on fixed-price construction contracts?

2)Would the inclusion of an EPA clause for steel products influence your decision to bid on the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Capital Asset Improvements project?

3)What type of EPA for steel products would most affect your decision to bid on the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Capital Asset Improvements project?  

4)Did your companys present or recent construction contracts include any type of EPA for steel products? If so, how many contracts and what types of EPA were used?  Did the existence of an EPA make any difference in your companys initial price proposal strategy?  If so, to what extent percentage-wise?

5)What mutual benefits would be derived from the inclusion of an EPA clause in the construction contract for steel products?

6)In previous construction contracts not having an EPA for steel products, has your company been compensated for market fluctuations in pricing? If yes, what mechanism was used?

7)Do you feel that a contract having an EPA for steel products affects/limits market competition?  Why or why not?

8)Are there any other standard or semi-standard supply/material categories that you feel may provide incentive or be of mutual benefit to contracting parties?

This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a request for quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 561920; size standard $7 M.</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES</p>
<p>A. The following items will be provided:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001:<br />Description: Exhibit booth space (10' X 10')<br />Qty: Twenty-six (26)</p>
<p>B. Period of Performance: 19 Sep 2011 through 21 Sep 2011</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic has been selected to host this year's Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award (CSTEA) participants. The CSTEA has been scheduled for 19-21 September 2011. Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception. As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-one competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements. The Air Force Association Veterans Benefits Association (AFAVBA) has selected the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic to host the AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition. Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) planning committee has determined that it is in the Government's better interest to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place. The AFAVBA has leased the entire Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic for 19-21 September 2011 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel. During CSTEA 2011, the AFAVBA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic. The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement. The AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists. Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment. The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA's CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program. Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.</p>

<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirements 1e.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. Manufacturer of quoted instrument shall have at least three (3) years of experience in manufacturing Atomic Force Microscopes. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices, IAW FAR 52.217-5.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<RESPDATE>051811
<CONTACT>Sue Hall, Administrative Assistant, Phone 304-457-3026, Email shall@wvca.us
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>**THIS WILL BE A LOCALLY-AWARDED CONTRACT (NON-FEDERAL)**<br /><br />AWARD WILL BE MADE BY THE TYGARTS VALLEY CONSERVATION DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>THIS PROJECT IS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH FEDERAL USDA/NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE FUNDS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Shavers Fork Mitigation Project is a natural stream habitat-improvement project extending along 4.5 miles of the Upper Shavers Fork trout stream. The improvements will provide connectivity, habitat structure, and thermal refuge for fish using major tributaries for spawning habitat. Fish habitat improvements include narrowing the channel in select areas, enhancing the low flow channel (thalweg), adding rock and wood features to the stream, and enhancing pools.</p>
<p>The project site is located high in the mountains of Randolph and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia surrounded by the Monongahela National Forest. The Upper Shavers Fork Watershed is 60.2 square miles within one of the highest rainfall regions in the state receiving 60 inches of precipitation annually. The elevation ranges from 3500 to 3800 feet above sea level, which provides ideal growing conditions for the native Red Spruce trees. Strict adherence to pollution control measures is required.</p>
<p>The uppermost project site, at the confluence of Rocky Run, is 13 railroad miles from the primary staging location at Cheat Bridge. Transportation of all materials, equipment, and personnel to the project site must be via the railroad owned by the West Virginia State Rail Authority. The Tygarts Valley Conservation District has secured permission to use the railroad exclusively for this project for the portion of railroad track required to complete the work. There are no roads to the construction site, but the primary staging area is easily accessible from Highway 250. The primary staging area for the project is located 12.5 miles east of Huttonsville on Route 250. The primary staging area has been used for other railroad repair projects, but requires some improvements. The successful contractor must meet all requirements for operating on the state-owned railroad. Additionally, the contractor must provide all of the special equipment required to complete the project.</p>
<p>The construction season is from April 1 to November 30. Winter shutdown is from December 1 to March 31. Construction is expected to take three full construction seasons, but it is permissible and desirable to finish the project in less time.</p>
<p>The project includes various fish habitat improvements covering 4.5 miles of remote trout stream with the following major work items: clearing and grubbing; pollution control; seeding and mulching; mobilization; deepening/enhancement of 33 pools and 4,227 linear feet of thalweg (low flow) channel; earthfill for streambank shaping; 530 tons of rock riprap; quality control; 2,320 square yards of geotextile fabric; planting 1,100 red spruce seedlings and 722 other trees and shrubs; 21,190 live stakes and branch cuttings used for streambank restoration; 1,070 tons of crushed aggregate; 10,050 tons of rock for 14 boulder j-hook vanes, 2 boulder cross vanes, and 45 single wing rock deflectors; placement of 66 boulders for in-stream fish habitat; 65 large woody debris structures; 2,250 square yards of streambank restoration using reinforced earth, toe wood, and brush mattresses; 500 feet of silt fence; 3,560 feet of wattles for sediment barriers; 15,750 square feet of timber mat surfacing, and 3,476 square yards of erosion control blanket.<br />&emsp;<br /><strong>SOLICITATION INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Tygarts Valley Conservation District located in Philippi, West Virginia will issue a Contract resulting from this solicitation. This is a Local Government project; however, it is partially funded with federal funding from the USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Service. The federal funding is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Due to the use of ARRA funding, this solicitation includes some special contract requirements.</p>
<p>All on-site personnel from the successful bidder shall attend a safety class taught by the Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad, which will be arranged by the Tygarts Valley Conservation District. The class will cover unique safety requirements to the WV Central Railroad where the project is located.</p>
<p>The estimated cost range for the project is between $1 million and $4 million.</p>
<p><strong>A MANDATORY Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will be held at 8:00am (local time) on Thursday, April 21, 2011 at the Huttonsville Public Service District building located in Mill Creek, West Virginia.</strong> Huttonsville PSD is located on Route 219/92/55 across from the Helvetia-Adolph Road also known as County Route 46. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Failure to attend both the Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will result in rejection of your bid</span>. Representatives for Tygarts Valley Conservation District and Engineering will be present to discuss the Project. Participants are encouraged to pack a lunch and wear appropriate clothing for the site visit. Plan for a long day with an estimated return time of 6:00pm. Rail transportation will be provided by Tygarts Valley Conservation District.</p>
<p><strong>Bids shall be due Wednesday, May 18, 2011 by 1:00pm (local</strong> <strong>time).</strong> Bids should be mailed or hand-delivered to the Tygarts Valley Conservation District Building located at Route 4, Box 501, Philippi, West Virginia. <strong>Bids will not be opened publicly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Bidders will be required to submit &nbsp;qualifications with their bid (See Instructions to Bidders Section- Article 3 of the solicitation).&nbsp; Tygarts Valley Conservation District will make&nbsp;award to the Contractor who meets all of the qualification requirements stated in Article 3 of the Instruction to Bidders&nbsp;and who has the lowest total bid price.</strong></p>

Brand Name Justification  Memotec FRADs

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) requires Frame Relay Access Devices (FRADs) to support MSCs role in providing logistics support to the Navy fleet by providing vital communications capabilities for MSCs vessels. 

Memotec FRADs were selected because they are the direct replacement for our currently installed or fielded FRADs and utilize the same proprietary protocol named PowerCell (PVCR) as was used in the previous model.
  Their reliability and compatibility with existing MSC systems has been demonstrated and are needed to maintain MSC configuration control and management.  They have been proven to meet the harsh requirements and tight confines of shipboard use and are necessary to support shipboard applications critical to the MSC mission.  Any other manufacturers product we try to add to this network will not be able to communicate with the Memotec equipment.

Military Sealift Command (MSC) must test every IT configuration and every piece of hardware, software, etc. being installed on board a class of ships. The platform is specific to previous images and deviating from the hardware configuration would cause significant rework and testing.
  The existing platform is already an accredited system so going to a non-accredited system would also create significant rework for all channels of Navy Network Security.  Standardization plays a key role in the efficiency of our network operation.  MSC has extensively tested the Memotec FRADs to make sure of their compatibility with existing systems on board ship and in the office environment. The hardware represented here has been tested and deployed as a standard configuration from ship to ship.  A different manufacturers FRAD product/solution aboard ships would tremendously hamper operability, utility and familiarity with equipment needed to support critical missions, thus resulting in an increase of Total Cost of Ownership.

The Memotec FRADs are considered to be the best viable solution for this requirement.
  Considering alternate brands is not a technological or economical option for this IT solution because of the proprietary protocol associated with this equipment.

<DESC>EPA Region 7 is seeking to procure the YSI Inc brand satellite telemetry systems that are compatible with EPA's existing YSI Inc. brand water quality monitoring equipment such as hand held units, data loggers, sondes,  multi-parameter probes, cables and an inventory of replacement parts.  EPA Region 7 will use this new equipment as interchangeably with existing equipment and will use many of the items to repair or modify existing hardware.  Over the past several years, several hundred paired turbidity readings and bacteria samples were taken by EPA Region 7 with YSI sondes, in order to derive a statistical relationship between bacteria and turbidity.  The use of a different manufacturer?s sondes would require Region 7 to repeat field collection, laboratory analysis, and data assessment at a significant expense, and would ultimately set the project back a year or more.  Additionally, EPA is entering into a joint long-term project to integrate their system with the U.S. G eological Survey`s YSI Inc. telemetry real-time system in the greater Kansas City area.  It is essential to the success of this joint effort that the EPA and USGS systems meet exacting standards of compatibility beginning with identical telemetry field equipment, since EPA may install additional EPA sondes on USGS probes.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Afghanistan</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government (USG) priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an OTI Deputy Country Representative that will support USAID/OTI's program in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the Technical Assistance Group.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG Team. USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a DRR Advisor who will work with OFDA technical experts to develop disaster risk reduction strategies for OFDA programming. At the GS-13 level, this will include leading the design of community-based disaster risk reduction strategies, coordinating transition from emergency assistance to development programming, monitoring of DRR activities, and providing representation at international forums.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor will be based in Washington, D.C. The duties and responsibilities are:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the assessment of priority countries for DRR interventions; participate in discussions regarding the needs and demands of these priority countries in the area of disaster risk reduction; provide technical input in order to assist in the design, development, and implementation of disaster risk reduction activities at the national and regional levels, including assisting with the formulation of national and regional capacity building programs;<br />&bull; Engage with the technical experts on USAID/OFDA's technical assistance group (TAG) to assist in the development of programs related to risk identification, capacity development, climate risk management, urban risk management and gender within each sector to ensure that DRR programming is technically sound, gender-sensitive, sustainable, and within OFDA's mandate;<br />&bull; In collaboration with the OFDA Regional Teams and TAG, review DRR proposals for appropriateness for OFDA funding, and identify areas where DRR can build upon ongoing disaster response and/or development programming; assist regional teams and technical leads in assessing gaps and needs;<br />&bull; Participate in discussions on disaster risk reduction policy initiatives and work to develop an increased awareness of disaster risk reduction strategies and activities within USAID/OFDA and other offices and bureaus, including lessons learned and evaluations of the experience of various international organizations in disaster risk reduction;<br />&bull; Consolidate information from lead DRR experts and present USAID/OFDA position on disaster reduction and recovery issues, and relevant policies, strategies, results and lessons learned in workshops, seminars and conferences;<br />&bull; Support regional advocacy efforts related to the promotion, adoption and endorsement of disaster risk reduction strategies;<br />&bull; Assist in the facilitation of internal advocacy efforts related to mainstreaming disaster reduction into USAID-supported development initiatives;<br />&bull; Manage the production and dissemination of both regular and occasional reports on USAID/OFDA activities in disaster risk reduction; prepare consolidated evidence gathered by lead DRR experts to support increased investment in DRR through cost-benefit analyses;<br />&bull; With input from OFDA/Office of the Director, assist with undertaking working level negotiations with counterparts in multi and bilateral agencies; coordinate with international donors, NGOs, UN agencies, and other regional, national, and local partners to promote the implementation of DRR activities in disaster-prone regions;<br />&bull; Serve as requested on field assessment missions, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs);<br />&bull; Serve as DCHA/OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>

<p>&bull; Serve as the focal point within USAID/OFDA for DRR programs and activities; contribute to the development and communication of appropriate DRR strategies and policies for OFDA and the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency response.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The DRR Advisor will take direction from and report to the Technical Assistance Group (TAG) Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The DRR Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The TAG Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals, objectives and functions.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13. POINT OF CONTACT: See Cover Letter.</p>
<p><br />EDUCATION/EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THIS POSITION<br />(Determines basic eligibility for the position. Applicants who do not meet all of the education and experience factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)</p>
<p>Master's or PhD degree with significant study in or pertinent to the field of disaster risk reduction -- this may include, but is not limited to, sustainable development, disaster management, natural resource management, capacity building (preferably at the local or community-level), economics, or social sciences. Additionally, a minimum of four (4) years of experience in policy analysis and strategy development, risk assessment, and/or research and analysis of international humanitarian or development assistance and/or disaster response, of which at least one (1) year must be specifically related to disaster risk reduction experience.</p>
<p><br />SELECTION FACTORS<br />(Determines basic eligibility for the position. Applicants who do not meet all of the selection factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)<br />&bull; Applicant is a U.S. Citizen;<br />&bull; Complete and hand-signed federal form OF-612 and OF-612 continuation sheets submitted;<br />&bull; All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 to allow for adequate evaluation of your related and direct experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the experience requirements.<br />&bull; Supplemental document specifically addressing the Quality Ranking Factors (QRFs) submitted;<br />&bull; Ability to obtain a SECRET level security clearance as provided by USAID.<br />&bull; Satisfactory verification of academic credentials.</p>
<p>QUALITY RANKING FACTORS (QRFs)<br />(Used to determine the competitive ranking of qualified applicants in comparison to other applicants. The factors are listed in priority order from highest to least.)</p>
<p>QRF #1 Describe your experience in designing and/or implementing disaster risk reduction programs at the: 1) community level, and 2) national level. What lessons have you learned from your experience at each level?</p>
<p>QRF #2 Donors and implementing agencies wrestle with the question of how to distinguish between disaster risk reduction programs and development programs. USAID/OFDA's mandate allows the use of the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account to fund DRR programs, but not development programs.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.

<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>

<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>Government Answers in Response to Questions from Interested Vendors for RFQ # D11PS18878 Solicitation Amendment 2
1.  Since this is a "100% Small Business Set-Aside", we would assume that the lead must be taken by a business concern.is that correct? 
Answer:  The lead or prime contractor must be with a small business concern vendor. 
2.  If # 1 above is true, then would an institute of higher education be eligible to participate as a subcontractor to the submitting Business Concern/Partner? 
Answer:   A higher education institute, being a university or college, may participate as a subcontractor as long as it does not surpass the percentage of contract work to be performed by the small business concern Contractor.  A services contract requires that 50 percent of the cost for contract performance incurred by personnel be spent on employees of the prime.  In this case, the prime is the small business.   
3.  If the prime contractor has limited past performance history pertaining to this solicitation can a current employee of a potential subcontractor be temporarily hired by the prime thus bringing past performance qualification into the prime's past performance capability? If so how should the past performance be worded in the contract?
Answer:  The resulting purchase order will be awarded to the prime contractor (a small business).  Past performance will be evaluation per the solicitation and in accordance with the established evaluation factors per FAR Part 52.212-2.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance of the prime offeror (prime contractor; thus, the one which has privity with the Government).  If the prime offeror does not have any past performance, then the Government will issue a neutral rating when conducting evaluations.

<DESC><p>This solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted:</p>
<p>Vendor questions and answers:</p>
<p>1. Question: The MCU is the master control unit, the MCR is the master control room, as the master location is mentioned, it is assumed this is all the same location as to where all of the conduits end? Where is the Main Control room location on drawing E043?</p>
<p>Answer: The Main Control Room is located on the second floor of the Confinement Building. It is not shown on the drawing and NIST will be responsible for running the communications cable between new centralized data collection unit of the Area Monitoring System and the equipment in the Main Control Room (MCR). Cable trays run around the perimeter of the two Guide Halls (original and new). Conduits run down from the trays to the Area Monitoring Detectors in the original Guide Hall or to the location for these units in the new Guide Hall. Drawing E043 shows the location of the existing detectors as well as the recorder rack which serves as the centralized data collection point in the current system.</p>
<p>2. Question: It states that 2 conduits with 4" boxes are provided at each monitor/detector location. DO both Conduits run to the Main Control Room?</p>
<p>Answer: No. These conduits run up to the cable trays that run around the perimeter of the new Guide Hall (approximately 6 feet). Nothing runs to the Main Control Room.</p>
<p>3. Question: Will NIST provide duplex 120V outlet and how far away from the detector/monitor?</p>
<p>Answer: The Radiation Monitoring System in the existing Guide Hall supplies electrical power to the individual detectors from the centralized recorder rack through the interconnecting cabling. No provisions for electrical power have been provided in the new Guide Hall. If the design requires an ac power source locally at the local Area Monitor Detector, NIST will provide the necessary outlets. Otherwise, NIST will provide electrical power to the centralized location for redistribution through the contractor's interconnecting cabling.</p>
<p>4. Question: If in fact NIST does provide AC power from one of the conduits, is the other conduit available for us to use for our communication line, and does that conduit go to the MCR and MCU?</p>
<p>Answer: Most of the cable runs associated with the existing equipment are in cable trays which will be available for use by the vendor supplying the new Area Monitoring System. Similar provisions have been made in the new Guide Hall. These trays run around the perimeter of the Guide Hall, both old and new. Conduits run from the cable trays to the mounting locations for the Area Monitoring System detectors.</p>
<p>5. Question: Contractor's are to supply 2 dry contacts, do you want Normally Closed, or Normally Open, and is NIST responsible to hook up the interlocks to our contacts, as we do not know what they are going to control?</p>
<p>Answer: The requirement is for two (2) sets of dry contacts and they are to be Normally Open (NO) contacts - contacts that are open when the armature is in the un-operated or de-energized position. NIST will be responsible for connecting these points into other equipment where appropriate.</p>
<p>6. Question: If in fact the 2 conduits at each location do terminate at the MCR / MCU, is the other conduit able to be used for our network wire?</p>
<p>Answer: The connections to the two (2) sets of dry contacts will be the responsibility of NIST. See response above concerning the use of the conduits and cable trays.</p>
<p>7. Question: If the answer is yes to question 6 above, what is the maximum length of conduit from the meter/detector to the MCU/MCR, as 100 meters, or approx 300 feet is about the maximum run we can provide without having to use some kind of a booster?</p>
<p>Answer: The cable trays run around the perimeter of the original and new Guide Halls. The dimension of the original guide hall is approximately 200 feet long by 100 feet wide by 50 feet high. The new guide hall is approximately 200 feet long by 80 feet wide by 50 feet high. Cable trays are installed approximately 10-12 feet above finished floor. Conduits only run from the cable trays to the mounting locations of the Area Radiation Monitoring detector.</p>
<p>8. Question: On each conduit, what is the maximum distance from each pullbox to pullbox, or pullbox to termination point?</p>
<p>Answer: Refer to response to Question Number 7 above.</p>

Currently, DoDEA uses Creative Curriculum&reg; for Preschool, and its associated digital assessment system, Creative Curriculum.net.

Teaching Strategies is the sole provider for Creative Curriculum. In order to have consistency in curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the PK integrated science materials must align directly with the current curriculum framework and assessment system utilized in DoDEA preschool classrooms.

All submissions must be received by the response date and time of this notice.

STATEMENT OF WORK

DISABILITY EXAMINATION SERVICES FOR COMPENSATION & PENSION  

A.  GENERAL INFORMATION

A.1		Scope of Work
Under the authority of 38 USC 1703(a)(8) and FAR Parts 12 and 15, Contractor shall provide Health Care Resources in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein, to be furnished to the VA MidSouth Healthcare Network (VISN 9).  VISN 9 is comprised of six medical centers in Huntington, West Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Mountain Home/Johnson City, Tennessee; and Nashville/Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the requirements described in the Statement of Work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  The Contractor is expected to perform required examinations and ancillary procedures with medical staff trained to perform Disability Examinations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) standards.  The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive examination, document all clinical findings, adhere to VA approved templates and shall provide completed reports to the VA through secure procedures.  The contractor shall additionally perform all administrative procedures to include contacting veterans and/or service members to schedule examinations. 
Contractor shall have the capability within 45 days of contract award and shall be mobilized to perform examinations for the VA MidSouth Healthcare Network (VISN 9) in the following counties: Cabell, WV (Huntington); Fayette, KY (Lexington); Jefferson, KY (Louisville); Shelby, TN (Memphis); Washington, TN (Johnson City); Knox, TN (Knoxville); Davidson, TN (Nashville); Rutherford, TN (Murfreesboro); and Hamilton, TN (Chattanooga).

A.2		Background
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Disability Compensation and Pension (C&P) Program provides monthly payments to veterans in recognition of the effects of disabilities, diseases, or injuries incurred or aggravated during active military service. A disability may be determined by VA to be service-connected on a direct basis, a secondary basis, a presumptive basis, or on the basis of aggravation. Compensation may also be paid for the worsening of a non-service connected condition aggravated by a service-connected condition. The VA Pension Program provides monthly payments, as specified by law, to needy wartime veterans who are permanently and totally disabled as a result of disability not related to military service. About 3 million veterans and their dependents receive VA disability C&P benefits.  VA conducts medical examinations and produces medical evidence reports based on those examinations.  VA Rating Specialists uses the Disability Examination reports and other available medical evidence from the claim to determine the rating of the compensable disability.

Disability examinations are critical pieces of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment, and thus the percent of disability that defines the benefits a veteran is awarded.  Because it is so critical, the examination report must be of highest quality, providing valid, essential information to support each disability diagnosed, impairment statement and causality opinion. It is not enough to simply state a diagnosis and impairment statement and opinion if necessary. The examination report must provide detailed information sufficient for Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) to arrive at a determination that is able to withstand the scrutiny of appellate review. 

A.3	Place of Performance
Contractor and subcontractor locations and military installations as required.

B.	STATEMENT OF WORK

B.1  General Requirements

B.1.1	The contractor will be required to perform disability examination services to support claims processing for veterans and or service members who have filed a claim for disability compensation or pension benefits. The contractor shall provide the full range of medical Disability Examinations for the following areas; musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; and dental and oral examinations.   Based on specific VA request, special purpose examinations shall be provided including: cold injury protocol, and aid and attendance or housebound status examinations. Audiology, dental, ophthalmology, and psychiatric examinations must be conducted by specialists in those fields.  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) examinations may be performed by certified general medical physicians combined with cognitive screening performed by qualified providers. 

B.1.2	Examinations for the following categories remain within the VA system except for special exception cases agreed upon in advance by VA and the contractor:  Original Gulf War Environmental Claims for undiagnosed illnesses; U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals cases; examinations for Aid and Attendance/Housebound benefits; examinations requiring hospitalization or surgical evaluation, such as sleep apnea or endometriosis needing laparoscopy; former Prisoners of War; 38 USC 1151 initial determinations; veterans residing in VA domiciliaries/nursing homes; and incarcerated veterans.  In addition, no requests for review of records in the determination of Death Indemnity Compensation (DIC) are sent to the contractor.

B.1.3	The Contractor shall furnish all required services, facilities, and equipment required to perform the contract in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications and at the established firm fixed price rates.  

B.1.4	The Contractor shall ensure that all staff performing Disability Examinations receive VA-approved training for all required disability examination modules and general VA disability examination training. 

B.1.5	The Contractor is expected to incorporate the accepted VA toolsets for performing examinations: CAPRI.  The VA information technology (IT) system, Compensation And Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) provides a graphical user interface to access the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  It is used to communicate Disability Examination requests and reports between VBA and VHA.  When VHA providers perform Disability Examinations they use CAPRI where they access a template framework that allows practitioners to use approved templates to perform VA Disability Examinations and the resulting examination results are then submitted through CAPRI. 

B.1.6	The Contractor may use their own information system for receiving examination requests, performing examinations, and returning completed examination reports.  Support of effective communication mechanisms of the exam request and completed reports from and to CAPRI is required.  

B.1.7	If the Contractor elects to use their own information system, the Contractor shall provide VA access to its secure Management Information System for real-time status information such as Veteran examination requests.  Contractor shall provide information technology capability to receive on-line examination requests, messages from VA, maintain status information accessible by VA, maintain completed examination reports accessible in a database for a period of not less than 18 months, and return completed examination reports to VA staff. 

B.1.8	The contractor shall resolve any erroneous bills received by veterans and issue appropriate documentation to the veteran that the issue has been resolved. 

B.1.9	The Contractor will have 45 days from contract award to have trained, qualified staff available and fully operational to perform disability examinations in at least 50% of the covered geographic area and 90 days to establish 100% coverage.  New geographic areas tasked after contract award will also use this start up approach and timeline.

B.2  Scheduling

B.2.1	The VA authorized ordering entities will issue a form 2507 to denote the types of Disability Examinations to be performed.  For Disability Examination requests that might require further clarification, the Contractor shall contact the requesting VAMC.

B.2.2    The VA requires the contractor to schedule Disability Examinations for the veterans and/or service members. The contractor shall make a minimum of one attempt to contact Veteran or Service Member Point of Contact (POC) via telephone to schedule appointments.  The contractor shall notify the veteran of the scheduled appointment date, time and location at least five days prior to the scheduled appointment by mail, telephone and/or e-mail, and works with the physicians office to assure that the veteran is seen within one hour of the scheduled appointment time. 

B.2.3	Every attempt is made to schedule examinations as close to the veteran's home of record as feasible.  The VA will be consulted when travel distance exceeds fifty (50) miles for non-specialist examination and one hundred (100) miles for specialist examinations.  The VA may allow for greater distances for remote geographical areas. 

B.2.4    Contractor shall limit rescheduling of a cancelled appointment to one (1) unless otherwise requested by VA.

B.2.5	The contractor also provides toll-free access for veterans to call with questions regarding their scheduled appointments from 8 am to 8 pm Eastern Standard Time.   

B.3  Medical Records

B.3.1	Review of medical records, or Claims File (C-File), by the examiner is required for some Disability Examinations and will be denoted on the exam request.  Medical records/C-Files will not be sent to the Contractor for every examination request.  VA will make available applicable veterans/service members medical records prior to the examination in a secure manner either with the exam request or within 2 business days of submitting the exam request.  The VA may provide the entire C-File or only the pertinent records for the exam request in either an electronic or hardcopy form.  

B.3.2	If hardcopy records are sent, the contractor may scan the contents of the claims file to be transmitted to the physician(s) electronically.  Contractor shall return the Veterans claims folders to their originating source in the same order in which they were received not later than five workdays after completion of the requested examination in the same condition in which they were sent; e.g., stapled items must be re-stapled together in the same manner, order, etc.   The Contractor shall ensure that the records are returned via a secure, traceable mailing method. Upon completion of the examination, the contractor shall also make the scanned electronic copy available for VA to obtain and upload into its Virtual VA system. 

B.3.3	Contractor shall provide physician(s) with a copy of the veterans medical records, if applicable or required by VA, prior to the examination in a secure manner.  

B.3.4	The contractor will maintain records that comply with applicable state and federal patient standards for privacy policy and the Privacy Act (i.e. HIPAA).  All records must be typewritten, accurate, complete and in compliance with professional standards.  

B.4  Exam Requirements

B.4.1	 All examinations shall be conducted in accordance with VA-issued examination worksheets specified in the examination request.  The C&P Worksheets, which can be found at: http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Benefits/exams/index.htm. The examination worksheets provide detailed examination requirements based upon legislative and court mandated criteria for VA disability entitlement determinations.  Changes may be made periodically to the examination worksheets to reflect changing regulatory or medical requirements.  VA will notify the Contractor in writing when changes occur.  Contractor shall accommodate all technical changes without revision of the price schedule unless the change results in the provision of a new service for which pricing had not already been established.

B.4.2	All test and procedures the examination worksheets require shall be conducted unless not medically advisable or declined by the individual examined.  The examination report must detail and document any reason for not performing a requested test or study.  Waivers for declined tests must be attached to the exams upon submission to VA. VA will not be providing a specific waiver form. Tests listed in the examination worksheets represent guidelines.  Additional standard tests may be used to establish a diagnosis or severity of disability.  Any additional tests necessary to establish a diagnosis or to determine severity of disease or injury shall also be conducted.  No invasive procedure shall be performed without the prior approval of the requesting office, the individual to be examined, and the VAMC.  

B.4.3	If recent test results are documented in the record and available to the examining physician for review, those tests need not be repeated unless specifically requested by the VAMC or there is indication of recent changes in the condition examined.  Unless otherwise specified in the examination worksheets, any tests conducted within a twelve-month period prior to the current examination shall be considered recent and sufficient, unless there is an indication of recent changes in condition being examined. 

B.4.4	All claimed conditions identified on the examination request MUST be examined.  All questions included in the examination worksheet must be answered.  If the answer is either yes or no, a clear statement must be included explaining why a definitive answer could not be provided and specifying the probability of a positive response with a statement of the evidentiary basis for that assumption.  A diagnosis must be provided or a statement included that the claimed condition was not found, for each condition specified in the examination request.  If a diagnosis cannot be established nor ruled out, the facts must be documented with a clear statement of why a diagnosis could not be established.  

B.4.5	A statement that a diagnosis could not be established because additional tests are required will not be an acceptable reason for returning an examination without establishing a diagnosis or providing a statement that the claimed condition was not found.  Unless the required tests were not medically advisable or are declined by the individual examined, incomplete reports that include a statement of this nature will be deemed unacceptable.  

B.4.6    Contractor shall segregate and bill appropriately between Expert Medical Opinions and Medical Record Reviews according to the Price Schedule. Expert Medical Opinions are in response to specific questions explicitly requested by the VAROs and contained in the exam order and are examiner-produced professional opinions required beyond the normal scope of an examination. A Medical Record Review, however, is the time spent by an examiner in reviewing a veterans or service members record and history in preparation for the examination. Medical Record Reviews are to be billed in accordance with the volume (in inches) of the information in the record that requires review.

B.4.7	Evaluation of musculo-skeletal conditions for functional loss of movement requires addressing the DeLuca requirement.  At this time, this requirement can be met by three repetitive range of motions of the structure being tested, and documentation of any change in range of motion. 

B.4.8	Use of Goldmann Bowl Perimeter Testing or similarly approved VA devices is required for visual field tests. 

B.4.9	Comprehensive General Medical Examinations must document a complete review of each system. 

B.4.10	Audiology exams must take place in a location that meets or exceeds all of the technical requirements as outlined in the work audiology examination work sheet/rating schedule. 

B.4.11	At the Veterans request, family members, caregivers, and significant others are permitted to accompany the Veteran during an examination but may not participate in and/or interfere with the examination.  Only service animals are permitted.

B.4.12	Completed examination reports shall include an indication of the examiners credentials (e.g. MD if performed by Medical Doctor) and signature.  The person signing the examination shall have been the person who conducted the examination and the VA will accept electronic signatures. 

B.4.13	The Contractor shall alert the Veteran or service member of any abnormal finding during the examination which the Veteran or service member should follow-up with their primary physician.

B.4.14	The Contractor shall ensure that examination reports are adequate and in compliance with the examination request worksheets with review of test results by examiners documented, and any discrepancies resolved. 

B.4.15	The VA is in the process of developing Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs).  DBQs are disease (condition) specific, and are designed to be easy for clinicians to use while succinctly providing the precise medical evidence needed by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives to make decisions on Veterans disability benefits claims. DBQs are designed to ensure adequate reports by including all ratings criteria for each condition.  Individual DBQs are expected to be released incrementally in the coming months when further direction will be provided since the intent is to replace the corresponding C&P Worksheet. Currently there are three DBQs available and included in the Price Schedule.  The DBQs are available at the following URL: http://www.vba.va.gov/disabilityexams/.   If the DBQ is to be used in the Disability Examination it will be indicated in the form 2507 exam request information.

B.5  Examiner Qualifications

B.5.1	The Contractor shall ensure all examiners have all licenses, permits, accreditation, and certificates required by law, and provide them to the COTR upon request.  The contractor shall ensure that the medical examinations are conducted by a graduate of an accredited medical school or other appropriately recognized professional school for non-physician providers.  Prohibited from participation are individuals who are excluded, suspended, or otherwise barred from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or any other Federal or Federally-assisted program; whose license to provide health care services is currently revoked or suspended by a State licensing authority pursuant to adequate due process procedures for reasons bearing on professional competence, professional conduct, or financial integrity; or who, until a final determination is made, has surrendered such a license while formal disciplinary proceedings involving professional conduct are pending.  All of the examiners licenses must be clear and unrestricted while performing examinations under this contract. Examiners are not required to be licensed in the state where the examination will occur in order to provide flexibility in using licensed, trained, experienced examiners at all locations.  This supports the use of traveling providers, especially in support of the VA/DoD joint initiative programs, and aids in site start up.

B.5.2	Physicians must be compliant with OSHA and the American Disabilities Act.  

B.5.3	The contractor shall ensure that examiners have current medical malpractice liability insurance coverage.  For States that maintain lower levels of medical malpractice liability insurance requirements for examiners/dentists, the VA will accept those State levels for the purposes of this contract.  

B.5.4	The contractor shall maintain documentation of their credentialing review on file and make that information available to the VA for review upon request.  The contractor shall check the status of its examiners on a semi-annual basis to ensure that licensing has not been revoked or disciplinary proceedings involving professional conduct are not pending.

B.5.5	The Contractor shall provide examiners and appropriately licensed facilities to conduct required laboratory testing, for the following areas, including, but not limited to: musculoskeletal; organs of sense, infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; traumatic brain injury (TBI);  neurologic; mental disorders; dental and oral examinations.

	Ensure that examiners understand the VA's principle of reasonable doubt ("as least as likely as not") in the application of disabilities
	Explain the concept of presumptive diagnoses in view of unique circumstances of military service
	Ensure that examiners understand how to assess and document pain 

B.5.12	The Contractor shall ensure that all practitioners performing Disability Examinations have received VA certification to perform Disability Examinations. The CPEP General Certification Course is included for all examiners and others are completed based on their support of specialty exams. Providers will be CPEP certified using VA Employee Education System (https://www.ees-learning.net) which provides easy access for non VA employees. This includes certification for the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) examinations. Cyber Security and Privacy Training are mandatory for all examiners and will use training materials from the VA.  

B.6  Privacy/Security

B.6.1	The contractor's staff will have access to sensitive veterans'/service members records.  The contractor shall prevent the unauthorized release of information obtained by employees in the performance of work required by this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that employees are aware of and receive training, as necessary, on all regulations and laws, such as the Privacy Act, that restrict the release of information.

B.7.2	The Contractor, upon receipt of an insufficient examination, shall return the corrected insufficient examination reports to the VA within 14 calendar days without additional charge to VA.  Insufficient examination reports are those that do not meet the examination worksheets requirements (i.e. no diagnosis, no testing performed, etc.)  The only exception will be for charges incurred due to additional tests authorized by VA. Examination reports returned for clarification, correction, or completion will be amended and returned without additional charge. 

B.7.3	The contractor shall demonstrate a quality assurance program to ensure that examination reports comply with the VA requirements before submission to the VA.  The Contractor shall ensure that examination reports are adequate and in compliance with the examination request worksheets with review of test results by examiners documented, and any discrepancies resolved.

B.7.4	Not greater than 2% of examinations shall be deemed insufficient due to providers action or lack of action.  VA will evaluate examinations using the examination worksheets as a baseline for requirements.  Quality will be determined based on completed examinations with all questions completely addressed and answered from the C&P examination worksheets; proper worksheets utilized; proper tests, procedures, laboratory work, and x-rays utilized; and correct billing codes and CLINS for examinations, tests, procedures, laboratory work, and x-rays utilized.  

B.8  Reporting

B.8.1	The Contractor shall forward to VA completed Disability Examination reports within an average of 20 days for C&P exams from receipt of the examination request.

Photographs shall be delivered within 24 hours of the report delivery date.

B.8.2	The contractor shall provide completed Disability Examination reports in an electronic Word and a PDF format signed by the examiner.  The Contractor may use their own information system for returning completed examination reports and support of effective communication mechanism of completed reports to CAPRI is required.  

B.8.3	The Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) a consolidated monthly status report of examination requests sorted by site not later than the 15th of each month for the previous month. These monthly status reports shall include overall and site-specific data for the following: 
1.	Number of C&P Exam Worksheets requested the previous month (showing distribution by site and by the type of worksheet)
2.	Number of C&P Exam Worksheets completed the previous month (showing distribution by site and by the type of worksheet)
3.	Number of examinees (i.e. Veterans or Service Members) requested to be seen for examination the previous month (showing distribution by site)
4.	Number of examinees (i.e. Veterans or Service Members) for whom examinations were completed the previous month (showing distribution by site)
5.	Number of examination reports pending with a list of the pending examination requests (to include claim number, name, and date of request)
6.	Average time from receipt of examination request to delivery of completed examination reports 
7.	Lists of rescheduled examinations, examinations cancelled for failure to report, and refusal to report
8.	Up-to-date status of all examiners with statement verifying that individual licenses and/or credentials have not been revoked and that disciplinary proceedings involving professional conduct are not pending within 26 calendar days of being offered an agreement by contractor.
9.	List any problems that arose and a statement explaining how the problem(s) was resolved or why have not yet been resolved 

B.9  Invoice and Billing

B.9.1	Invoices will be transmitted to the ordering facility using a CMS 1500 health care billing form for each Veteran or Service Member.  The CMS 1500 claim form will contain all of the ancillary procedures performed and will identify the disability examination using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Code 99456 with the applicable Contract Line Item Pricing (for Disability Examination) and will identify the type of examination in the modifier section.  Contractors will invoice monthly based on the actual examinations performed.  Standard red and white CMS 1500 forms should be used.  Black and white forms will not be accepted by VA.  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) can also be used, via Emdeon, to submit claims (http://www.nonvacare.va.gov/edi.asp ).

B.9.2	The unit prices for tests, laboratory work, procedures, and x-rays is the agreed upon percentage outlined in the Price Schedules. At the time of invoice, the agreed upon percentage will be applied to the current National Medicare baseline using the applicable Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code to determine the unit price at the time of invoice. Current National Medicare baseline is defined as the National Medicare baseline at the time the test, lab, procedure or x-ray was performed where the National Medicare Baseline is the nationally uniform relative value of the service for physician work.  The formula used to determine the billable amount is as follows:

(Work RVU + Practice RVU)*Conversion Factor = reimbursement rate
(Reimbursement rate) x (proposed percentage in price schedule) = billable amount

In cases where a CPT code lacks a "Work RVU", then whatever formula is being used to compute the CPT price should have the Mal-Practice RVU component removed from the formula, and follow through with the adjusted formula to determine the new reimbursement. This reimbursement is then multiplied by the percentage found in the price schedule to determine the billable amount. The current National Medicare baseline is published annually on the following web site: http://www.cms.gov/. A comprehensive list of CPT codes can be found at http://www.ama-assn.org/.

<DESC>Continuation of Questions and Answers to RFQ/Solicitation # 4 D11PS18877
3.  (a) Can you elaborate on your definition of "producer"?
Answer:  Technically this is someone or group that is growing the crop and ultimately selling it for biofuel use. Please see the definition for Producer on page 38 of the solicitation.
3.  (b)  Provide examples of whom the residue would be used by commercially. 
Answer:  Anybody that is using the residue as a potential biofuel product.  
3.  (c)  Do you have a perspective on demand of corn stover, straw and other residues? 
Answer:  The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the demand for corn stover, straw and other resides as a potential biofuel crops.
4.  (a)  Would you help us understand your view of the prospective purchasers of this type of insurance coverage?  
Answer:  The prospective purchasers of this type of insurance would be the specific producers of the crop. 4.  (b)  Beyond agriculture producers, do you foresee including commercial purchasers (e.g. aggrigators, ethanol plants and others) as potentially insured entities? 
Answer:  No, our legislation would limit us to only insuring the producers. 
5.   Corn and straw analysis might generally be viewed as a super-regional effort, primarily the U.S. Midwest. The use of the term "orchard" throughout the solicitation indicates additional growing areas outside of the Midwest. Can you please clarify your expectations for geographic scope for this project and if there is a desire to determine feasibility for geographic areas where biomass might not be as plentiful as in the U.S. Midwest? 
Answer:  The purpose of this feasibility is to determine the geographic locations, we are not limiting the research to the Midwest, the current production of the crops, and the potential if there is a need for crop insurance.  
6.  The requirements of the Draft Feasibility Report include a Review of Other Programs (page 41 of 46 of the solicitation), in which "the Contractor shall list and summarize the provisions and benefits of all state and federal programs that currently support or subsidize these producers." We believe that this alone is a formidable task, as there are hundreds of such programs available to producers. Can you please clarify your expectations on this point?  
Answer:  We are looking for what types of programs, both government, statewide or private insurance that are currently available specifically to subsidize the producers with their risk management needs for these crops. 
7.   Are you expecting the bid as a part of the feasibility analysis to examine risk management tools currently in use by producers beyond traditional crop insurance, including weather derivatives and other hedging tools?  
Answer:  Yes, we are anticipating the contractor will provide RMA with information about what types of risk management tools these producers currently utilize. 
8.   Are there specific residues within the term "Other Residues" which you would like the feasibility study to evaluate as a part of the project? 
Answer:  Any other residues that the contractor deems feasible as a result of his research should be included in the report. RMA does not want to limit the number of residue crops from the research, some of the crops that have specific residue that RMA is aware of are as follows: corn stover, wheat, barley, rice, and oats.
9.   Do you anticipate coverage extending beyond harvest and into the storage period? 
Answer:  No, RMA is not allowed to cover storage. 
10.   For risk analysis, would you prefer disaster program payment history at the state level, county level, or another grouping? 
Answer:  The state level would be sufficient. 
11.   A very wide range of residues is potentially available from agricultural and horticultural production.  Each could find a use as a source of biomass feedstock for advanced biofuel production.  Could you provide criteria for choosing which of the innumerable crop residues to include in the study?     
Answer:  RMA would anticipate that the residue crops would come from either the list identified in question 6, or any other crop bi-products that the contractor could be feasible.
12.  Please confirm that the term "aquaculture" (page 41 of 46, final full paragraph) should be "agriculture".
Answer:  See RFQ/Solicitation Amendment 2 with the corrected language.

<DESC>Additional Questions to Industry:

In addition to the information previously requested, industry responders are encouraged to address significant capabilities not already identified in the RFI that would be of value in the execution of MCOTEA's mission.  Such additional information shall be incorporated as additional rows in the spreadsheet response.

Lastly, the government is seeking Industrys advice on appropriate incentive structures that a contractor would find value in should the government solicit a contract type of Fixed Price Incentives Fee (FPI).

Questions and Answers to Date--

Q - Is it the governments intent to limit responses in Part One to the per cell character limits inherent to Excels functionality?

A - The government, and specifically MCOTEA, is currently using MS Office Excel 2007 and the character limits for an individual cell are considered to be adequate, given the constraint on the size of RFI responses.
  If necessary, contractors can insert an additional row within the spreadsheet to provide an effective description of relevant capabilities.

Q - If it is the governments intent to limit responses as described in question 1, could the government clarify these limits specifically?

A - It is not the government's intent to limit responses, other than to constrain the overall length of the RFI response.

Q - If it is not the governments intent to limit responses as described in question 1, how does the government prefer respondents address any need to use multiple cells in response to any single item identified in Part One?   

A - It is not the government's intent to limit responses, other than to constrain the overall length of the RFI response.
 If necessary, contractors can insert an additional row within the spreadsheet to provide an effective description of relevant capabilities.   

Q - Will the government consider allowing respondents to utilize a MS Word table for responses to Part One?

A - Responses shall be in Excel spreadsheet format.

Q - Part One provides instructions on the core capabilities utilizing the Matrix provided.  Are we to assume the response to Part One is to incorporated within the Matrix provided?  Or will a supplemental narrative be expected as well?  

A - Responses shall be in Excel spreadsheet format addressing each of the governments called out areas.  Should the contractor not exceed the 25 page limit and have additional page availability after addressing each of the areas within the Excel matrix template provided, then the contractor may choose to submit additional information by means of his own choosing.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Maintenance and service of the Nuance Dictation System.

3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  The Nuance Corporation is the sole source provider of the maintenance and service to the products it manufactures.  Nuance is the only Company that can provide maintenance and service for the upgrade for the Enterprise Express System; the Build 6.x to 7.x Voice/Text Software Version; and all future upgrades.  This dictation and speech recognition system supports Enterprise-Wide Medical Transcription for the Medical Center, as well as the clinical staff at the CBOC's.  The Dictaphone Enterprise Speech system has a wide range of speech-driven dictation options that match our diverse workflow and changing documentation needs, all on one single platform. 
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  (a) Authority.  (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Nuance is the only Company that can provide maintenance and service for the upgrade for the Enterprise Express System; the Build 6.x to 7.x Voice/Text Software Version; and all future upgrades.  The Nuance / Dictaphone software is integrated with the Milwaukee VA's Vista data base system.  Nuance supports ongoing maintenance and servicing of the hardware and software of the dictation/transcription system which contains proprietary information.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center conducted research and the facility concluded there were no viable GSA contracts for the product. Contracting Officer emailed 3 vendors from the GSA schedule.  Two vendors did not respond and one responded that they cannot provide the level of service requested. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was compared and confirmed with the end user on past purchases for the same or similar type equipment and is comparable.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The facility was provided information of similar services available.  The facility conducted further market research and indicated the services did not meet their minimum needs.  Contracting Officer also emailed 3 vendors from the GSA schedule. Since this is a unique request, no further market research was conducted.

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The enduser and contracting officer conducted market research.  Contract Officer posted an intent to sole source on January 19th 2011 and received only one response. After further discussion, the company responded that they could not provide the level of services that was needed in the statement of work.  

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

	JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE
	USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
                
                   DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
                 VA Southwest Health Care Network  VISN 18
                        6950 E. Williams Field Rd
                              Mesa, AZ 85212


Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of GSAM 506.303-1 and FAR 6.302-1(1), if you solicit only one source, document the file to explain the lack of competition.


1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  

The VA Southwest Health Care Network  VISN 18 Consolidated Contracting Activity, 6950 E. Williams Field Rd, Mesa, AZ 85212.


2.	Nature/Description of Action

This activity proposes to solicit with Fairmount Building, using other than full and open competition procedures to provide the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Medical Center Finance Office with lease extension until a procurement of a new Real Property Lease Space is completed (anticipated January 2013).


3.	Description of Supplies/Services

This requirement is for approximately 9,861 USF to house the administrative staff from the Phoenix VAMC that provides services to the hospital and the patients. The current lease is set to expire on March 31, 2011.This activity proposes a two (2) year lease extensions for lease V644R-0008. The current requirement is for a two year extension from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2013.

On June 17, 2010, the Phoenix Medical Center Director requested a lease extension for lease V644R-0008 from the Real Property Service. The Phoenix Medical Center Director requested the lease extension be procured through VISN 18 CCA delegated authority. VISN 18 CCA received approval from Real Property Service providing delegation approval to implement the lease extension. The current requirement is for a two year extension from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2013, as the Department of Veterans Affairs has continued need for the leased space.  


4.	Identification of Statutory Authority

The statutory authority permitting Lease Extensions is GSAM 570.405 and Using Other than Full Competition found under GSAM 506.303-1 & FAR 6.302-1(1), if you solicit only one source, document the file to explain the lack of competition. This document serves as documentation and explanation for the lack of competition for actions that exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold

FAR 6.302-1(1) permit contracting without providing full and open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only once source and no other type or services will satisfy the needs of the agency if the agency is planning to move and encounters unexpected delays.
                                                                             
5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:

a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:

The Phoenix VAMC Finance Office are located at the 4001 North Third Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85012 at the Fairmount Plaza. The current lease is located in walking distance to the Phoenix VAMC. It allows for easy commute to and from the medical center for VA employees. At this time, due to the continued construction projects and limited space the departments cannot relocate back to the medical center facility. The Phoenix VAMC has determined that they require an additional 26,000 square feet of administrative space for in addition to the 9,861 square feet. A pervious request submitted to VA Central Office in January of 2009 for request to purchase space was denied. Due to the size, complexity, time and costs associated with moving. It would not be feasible to conduct a temporary lease to supplement the lease extension. Furthermore, it would be in the Governments best interest to remain at the current location until Real Property Service is able to locate and provide new space.

A solicitation for new space is expected to be issued by Real Property Service in December 2011, with an award anticipated no later than May 2012.  The proposed lease extension will provide sufficient time for award of the new lease as well as completion of the build out of the new space prior to acceptance. Because of the amount of time needed to complete this requirement, the Contracting Officer is requesting approval to extend the existing lease for two years pursuant to the authority of GSAR 570.405 (c)(1).  The period of performance of the extension will be from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2013.  

The current negotiated lease rate for the base and current extension period is $16.00 per ANSI/BOMA square foot for an unserviced lease, totaling $157,776 each year for the extension period.  This rate has already been determined to be fair and reasonable to the Government.  It is anticipated that the Lessor will agree to the extension without a change in the rental rate.  If an increase in the rental rates is requested, further negotiations will take place to ensure that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable.  

There are two significant factors that controlled the establishment of the pre-negotiation objectives and the negotiated agreement.  First, the Government requires the lease extension in order to provide sufficient time to complete a replacement lease as well as complete any build out requirement to meet the Governments requirements.  Secondly, in order to justify any request increase in the rental rate the Government must be able to show that proposed rate is fair and reasonable.  



      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:	Fairmount Building,4001 North Third Street,
Phoenix, Arizona 85012



							 
6.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost

The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the current market rents. It is anticipated that the lessor will agree to the extension without a change in the rental rate.


7.	Description of market survey and any interested sources. If no market survey was conducted, state the reason.

The procurement was solicited orally by checking yellow pages and visiting the www.loopnet.com .

8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:

Due the importance of the Human Resource, Finance, and Logistics departments to the operations of Phoenix VAMC and the urgent nature of the procurement other than full and open competition procurement procedures are appropriate.

9.	Sources expressing an interest: Fairmount Building,4001 North Third Street,
Phoenix, Arizona 85012


10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:

Market research was conducted and there seems to be a lack of suitable offices in close proximity to the current Phoenix VAMC facility.


11. Delivery Requirements: As determined by the SFO.



12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (x) is not required for this acquisition.

13. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (x) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, include appropriate approvals.


The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification have been prepared by:

<DESC>The STP 420ES Tissue Processor features more robust hardware and ease-of-use will enable a higher-throughput processing for large volumes of tissue to meet the demands of Eisenhower Army Medical Center Pathology laboratory. <br>Recent studies conducted with a major Midwest university show fluid exchange ratio of the rotational agitation to be seven times more effective in processing tissue than conventional tidal agitation, with a maximum processing capacity of up to 420 tissue cassettes makes same-day processing, even in the most demanding laboratories, a breeze.  Dual chambers provide simultaneous or independent processing of both small and large batches.  Easy-to-use, user friendly touch screen operation. Reduce workload peaks and achieve an even workload distribution with rapid processing. Combine with Fast Flex reagents to optimize tissue morphology for H&E and advanced staining. <br>
