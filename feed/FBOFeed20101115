<DESC>Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) intends to develop, field, and sustain a modular net-centric Command and Control (C2) and data management application for current and future Personnel Recovery.  This is a follow on to the Personnel Recovery Management Software (PRMS) fielded and operational in the National Personnel Recovery Center in Selfridge, MI.  PRC2 is designated as the Command and Control Personnel Recovery resource to support the Theater Air and Space Operations Center (AOC).  As such, this system must support the Preparation, Planning, Execution and Adaptation functions of the Personnel Recovery process.  This development will operate on the new Air Force architecture of the Command and Control Air Operations Suite (C2AOS) and employ the Command and Control Information Services (C2IS) data structure.  Additionally, this software must interface with the existing TBMCS legacy systems for weather (Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)), Air Tasking Order!  (ATO) and intelligence information (Global Command and Control System Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (GCCS I3)) until these systems are replaced by the next generation C2AOS.  This capability must support the existing and planned 406 Megahertz emergency beacon types and systems including Hook2 and Combat Survivor Evader Locater ( CSEL) and support C2AOS operations for situational awareness, mission planning, asset allocation, mission execution and reporting.  PRC2 will participate in the C2AOS/C2IS Industry Day on Dec 1 at the Hanscom Conference Center (See FedBizOps.gov Solicitation # R2667) and participate in One-on-One interviews on Dec 2 in the John Hancock Conference Room at Hanscom AFB, in Bldg 1614.  Please reserve your seats and make One-on-One appointments through C2AOS/C2IS.  If you have already submitted a response, please provide any required revision in attendance.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the following services related to VA Medical Center projects 528A5-11-501, 502 and 503; "AE Design Services."

The VA Medical Center, Canandaigua, New York is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide construction documents, working drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and other related design services to include construction period services as required to design for the replacement of condensate lines in the corridor trenches of three buildings. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS
	The condensate lines in the trench from the south of building 4 through the corridors to the north of building 3 must be replaced. The lines leak condensate and are deteriorating the tunnel floor and building structures. The insulation on the lines is asbestos, fallen off of the pipes for the most part and must be abated.

WORK ENVIRONMENT
	The work area is the corridors that run through and connect the basements of buildings 4, 2 & 3. This area is heavily traveled and there are numerous functions in the rooms off these corridors. All work must be carefully phased so as not to interfere with the patients, staff or the functions in these areas.

PHASING
A phasing plan must be developed to address the pedestrian access to the rooms and functions
that are on the construction side of the corridors. It may be necessary to design an alternate traffic pattern to and from these corridors into some of the function rooms. These may include enclosed, outside walkways where necessary.

PROJECT SCOPE
	This scope combines three (3) projects, refer to drawing # 2909 for the location of the work. The work scope is essentially the same for each project. The trench must be opened under containment, the asbestos abated, the condensate pipes replaced and all tie-ins re-connected.

A.	BUILDING 4 CONDENSATE TRENCH - PROJECT # 528A5-11-501 
1.	Temporary barrier must be constructed, with provision for pedestrians to continue using corridor adjacent to work area. 
a.	This corridor is heavily traveled so a plan must be developed to execute the work while still providing for the safe travel of clients and staff from adjacent buildings to the services in B-4.
b.	Consideration must also be given to the Canteen Services function so that their work can continue with minimal interruption. The canteen operates 5 days a week, 7:00 am to 3:30 pm.
c.	The Canteen kitchen is on the opposite side of the hallway. Therefore provision must be made to accommodate the transfer of food across the hall during open hours.
d.	Some or all work may have to be planned for after business hours when there is less traffic through the corridor.

B.	BUILDING 2 CONDENSATE TRENCH - PROJECT # 528A5-11-502
1.	Temporary barrier must be constructed, with provision for pedestrians to continue using corridor adjacent to work area. 
a.	This corridor is heavily traveled so a plan must be developed to execute the work while still providing for the safe travel of clients and staff from adjacent buildings through this hallway.
b.	Consideration must also be given to the dietetic function so that their work can continue with minimal interruption.
c.	Some or all work may have to be planned for after business hours when there is less traffic through the corridor.

C.	BUILDING 3 CONDENSATE TRENCH - PROJECT # 528A5-11-503  
1.	Temporary barrier must be constructed, with provision for pedestrians to continue using corridor adjacent to work area. 
a.	This corridor is heavily traveled so a plan must be developed to execute the work while still providing for the safe travel of clients and staff in this corridor.
b.	Consideration must be given to the staff and residents using the elevator from the 1st and 2nd floors. A plan must be developed to allow this elevator to remain in service during demolition and construction.
c.	Some or all work may have to be planned for after business hours when there is less traffic through the corridor.

CONSTRUCTION 
1.	Saw cut and remove concrete above condensate trench. 
2.	Abate asbestos containing pipe insulation and any mastic on the cover. 
3.	Replace the condensate pipes with Type K Hard Drawn, Seamless Copper, Extra Heavy, the same size as existing pipe. 
4.	Re-insulate condensate pipe with cellular glass, closed cell foam, +900F 0 water vapor emission. 
5.	Provide positive drainage in the condensate trench in each building. Slope to a new sump pit at the south end of each corridor. 
6.	Install removable, 2' wd. X 8' lg. trench covers. The covers are to be " thick, aluminum covers to accept VCT flooring. The covers should be placed at tie-in points. Where no tie-ins exist for some distance, covers should be spaced 40' apart at the furthest.

<DESC>SECTION B   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENTOFWORK

B.1. ADHC will be furnished to beneficiaries for whom such care is specifically authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  It is understood that the type of patient to be cared for under this contract will receive these services as a substitute for institutionalization. The purposes of providing ADHC are to enable functionally impaired individuals to reside in supportive home environments rather than in ADHC care facilities; to facilitate the return of older veterans to their home and coordinate long term care there by reducing readmissions to hospitals and ADHC; to maintain the older veteran at the highest level of functioning possible; to improve the quality of life for the participants among their peers; and to provide support for the family and other care givers of older veterans. The care provided will include: physician services, nursing, social work services, occupational or physical therapy, assistance with activities of daily living, activity therapy, case management, and nutrition service including meals. The ADHC Program will meet the VA standards for ADHC as promulgated in 38 CFR Part 17.51c through 17.51e.

a. Unless specifically excluded in this contract, the per diem rate established will include the services listed above and will also include all services or supplies normally provided other patients by the facility without extra charge.

b. If the VA and the ADHC Program agree that the VA shall provide services under 38 CFR 17.51f, the agreement will be incorporated into the contract and either the per diem rate will be re-established, or direct payment made to the United States to reflect the full cost of the VA's contribution.

B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

B.3. Absences of the patient from the ADHC Program in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable except with prior approval of the placing VA facility.

B.4. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained. VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility. If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.

B.5. In the event a VA beneficiary receiving ADHC care under this contract dies, the ADHC will promptly notify the VA office authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patients personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by VA patients upon the premises of the ADHC shall be delivered by the ADHC to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the ADHC for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with a notation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA office authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient have no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust. In these cases the ADHC will forward inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA office authorizing admission, and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.

B.6. The ADHC Program shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin. The ADHC Program shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom. The term "facilities" shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, and entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the ADHC and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.

B.7. The ADHC shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this contract for any person determined eligible by the Adult Day Care Coordinator or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered. In addition, the ADHC Program warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.

B.8. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veterans transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the ADHC in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.

B.9. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the ADHC will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the ADHC for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient.

B.10.  The beneficiary will be provided ADHC at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the treatment plan received from VA, unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.

B.11. It is agreed that the ADHC Program will submit a report each month on the attendance, medical, functional and psychosocial status of beneficiaries receiving care under the contract to the VA along with a monthly invoice for beneficiaries receiving care under the contract.

B.12. The contract home is required to notify the VA Medical Center if a veteran on a VA contract incurs a sentinel event and/or adverse patient reaction. This may include but are not limited to the following: 1) fall resulting in death or injury; 2) elopement resulting in a missing patient; 3) patient abuse confirmed or under investigation; 4) medication error resulting in patient illness/injury; 5) death or injury secondary to restraint usage; 6) and a patient death related to unconfirmed or suspicious nature.

<DESC>Aircraft certification (civil) and airworthiness qualification (military) testing assesses an aerial vehicles performance and handling qualities for all flight regimes (e.g., take-off, landing, cruise, hover, autorotation, etc.).  Flight in icing conditions is one of the flight environments that must be tested.  For over 30 years, the Army has used the CH-47 hosted Helicopter Icing Spray System to provide military and civilian aircraft designers with an artificial icing cloud as a faster, lower cost, lower risk alternative to natural icing testing in instrumented meteorological conditions.  This requirement will be for the acquisition of the CGS which will replace the current HISS.  The CGS is expected to provide several significant improvements to the HISS.  These include improved cloud characteristics, larger spray array for full rotor immersion, a spray array for full fuselage immersion, palletized design to alleviate the requirement for a dedicated highly modified CH-47D.  The successful contractor(s) will be responsible for design, development, fabrication, integration, and test of both the permanently installed on-aircraft equipment (A-Kit) and the on-aircraft removable mission equipment (B-Kit).   The CGS B-kit consists of a water spray system with integral water storage that, when installed, converts the CH-47 into an icing tanker that produces artificial clouds used for ice or rain testing.  The spray boom delivers the water to the nozzles which spray the water to form the cloud.  Additional subsystems include the spray controls, boom control, station keeping/pilot cueing, mechanical aircraft interface, and safety equipment.   The CGS kit will be capable of being installed on any CH-47D or F Model with minimal-to-no permanent aircraft modifications (A-kit), allowing the host aircraft to maintain a multi-role mission capability.  Additionally, the successful contractor(s) will be responsible for supporting Government Air Worthiness Certification and testing of the system.<BR><BR>The OHISS competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with the utilization of best value trade off procedures.  The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) Class Code is 336414.  The small business size standard is 1000 employees (this is only applicable to small business offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  This solicitation will result in the award of a single Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract (CPFF).  The Bidders Library for this effort can be accessed by contacting the Contract Specialist listed below.  PEO STRI anticipates issuing the draft RFP  electronically on FedBizOpps in May 2010.  <BR><BR>The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for any  Bid & Proposals (B&P) costs for offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>Please direct all correspondence to Corretta M. Benton, Contract Specialist by electronic mail at corretta.benton@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved Program Development Study (PDS) to be developed during the Request for Proposal stage of this procurement process. Detailed data sheets for each occupied space in the existing building will be available at the time of Conceptual Design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design and construction work will require extensive capabilities in both renovation design as well as structural/seismic upgrades in an occupied building, with all work to be in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, including Federally established energy and sustainability goals, accessibility requirements and security specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Demonstrated capability to achieve Design Excellence in the execution of the project will be a key consideration.</p>
<p>The project encompasses major alteration work of approximately 56,578 usable square feet within 231,000 gross square feet in an occupied 4 level office structure with both underground and surface parking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The major tenant of the James C. Corman Federal Building is the Department of State.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design aspect of the offer will be expected to provide Tenant Improvement layouts with full description of construction means and methods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the offeror will need to fully demonstrate the constructability of phasing in an occupied building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The focus of the alteration work will be the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> floors.</p>
<p>Prospective offeror's experience must include, but is not limited to, demonstrated experience executing major renovation projects involving significant seismic as well as mechanical, electrical, plumbing and data infrastructure reconstruction conducted in a sequenced manner in an occupied building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, testing, LEED commissioning, and other related services necessary to construct the renovations and improvements to the James C. Corman Federal Federal Building. Related services shall include, but are not limited to, site and construction sequence planning, infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation, monitoring, permitting, industrial safety and monitoring, and all necessary inspection services during construction, commissioning and potential other related additional requirements.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the renovation and alteration improvements for the project is projected to be over $10,000,000, with project award anticipated in June 2011. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Award will be subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Procurement Strategy: GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price competitive acquisition using the best-value trade-off process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Two-Stage procurement process for the Design-Build Contract will be based upon evaluation criteria developed pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.3 TWO-PHASE DESIGN-BUILD SELECTION PROCEDURES, FAR Subpart 36.6 ARCHITECTURE-ENGINEERING SERVICES, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program (www.gsa.gov/designexcellence).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Stage One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Stage Two proposals (the short list will be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Stage One Proposal.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA"> </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">In Stage One, the Government will identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Stage Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Stage One will not be allowed to participate in the second stage. The RFQ will be released on or about 11/01/2010.</span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">In Stage Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the 3 (or 4 if the Contracting Officer determines 4 to be advantageous to the Government) most highly qualified Offerors from Stage One and request that they submit Stage Two proposals. Stage Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Stage Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Stage Two of the solicitation will require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The government anticipates the requirement of short-listed firms to submit a design concept for consideration as part of the evaluation criteria for Stage Two. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial technical and price proposals without discussions. Per FAR 28.102, Performance and Payment Bonds will be required by the successful offeror in the penal amount of 100 percent of the original contract price. </span></p>

The image generator must produce 30 channels visual and 5 channels of sensor to include FLIR, CCD and Radar. This requires integrating host software and cockpit interface software. The integration cost must also include integrating the HEDS group's plug-in software for drawing symbology on the 5 Sensor channels on Multi Function Displays. Please estimate any costs to do this integration and why it would be feasible.
<p>When responding please include:<br />1. Company Name and Cage code.<br />2. Who is your POC please provide email address and phone number.<br />3. Experiences with same or similar items, please describe.<br />4. Suggested NAICS Code.<br />5. Business Size Classification for NAICS and qualifications if any as any sub-category.

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: Man Moy@us.army.mil<BR><BR>This is a SSA to identify additional sources that can provide the Lateral Accelerometer, part of the UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS). The AFCS is an electro-hydro mechanical system that provides inputs to the flight controls, which assists the pilot in maneuvering and handling the aircraft.  The Lateral Accelerometer provides oscillation damping (dynamic stability), and maintains desired altitude, speed, and heading (static stability). The Government is planning to award a Three Year IDIQ with an approximate procurement quantity of 600 units per year. The only current source for the Lateral Accelerometer is BEI Technologies, Inc. (BEI), Precision Systems & Space Division, 1100 Murphy Drive, Maumelle, Arkansas 72113. CAGE is 12050. The current Lateral Accelerometer provided by BEI is identified by NSN 6680-01-326-8168, BEI PN 4384A-2-P63A. Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of the Lateral Accelerometer are not available from the Army.  Any sources interested in the proposed action must be able to demonstrate that they can provide form, fit, and function replacements to currently procured Lateral Accelerometer.  Additionally, Airworthiness Release (AWR) is required before equipment can be used on Army aircraft. AWR involves environmental, electromagnetic interference, and flight testing.  Interested sources must provide information to verify that their items have obtained the required AWR from the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, or details of when an AWR is anticipated to be received. Additionally, provide information on your production lead time, as well as the status of your production line.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  
The purpose of this sources sought notice it to determine if there are Service-Disabled Veteran and/or HUBZone small business concerns capable both technically and financially of successfully performing the project summarized below.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular, whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
The Proposed Project: Evaluate, design, and remodel an approximately 2,500 gross square foot visitor center that will result in a "Silver" rated or better certification in accordance with U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The visitor center is located at Lake Pleasant Regional Park north of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona.  It is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation and managed by Maricopa County Parks and Recreation.
With "water" as the common theme, upgrade visitor center exhibits and experiences to make it a true Lake Pleasant Regional Park "Discovery Center" and key visitor destination. The Goal is to distinguish the "Discovery" Center from other local facilities by capitalizing on the unique environmental, cultural, engineering (New Waddell Dam), natural history, and recreational features found in the Park.
To fulfill the Vision and accomplish the Goal, a variety of issues must be addressed:  utilities need to be upgraded and alternative "Green" solutions should be considered; exhibit, sales, and media areas must be improved, revised and updated; a temporary visitor must be established to provide minimal, limited information to visitors during the remodel; and the existing structure must be used for the upgrade.  
History of the Proposed Project: 
The Lake Pleasant Regional Park Visitor Center is located on a terrace at the western end of New Waddell Dam.  It was constructed in 1990 by Reclamation as an overlook where visitors could observe construction of the new dam. Professionally designed exhibits featuring prehistoric and historic objects from Reclamation collections were installed inside including a large park map that showed points of interest using a push-button lighting system.
With the completion of New Waddell Dam in 1993, the visitor center has continued to provide an exceptional opportunity for visitors to be introduced to the diverse resources of the Park.  In the ensuing years, Park staff has added a wide variety of material to complement and enhance the original exhibits. These include brochures and promotional literature, additional exhibits, found objects, live animals, and growing inventory of snacks, beverages, and gift items for sale.  These diverse materials occupy every available space and then some, and offer little in the way of an organized, consistent educational presentation.
Twenty years later, the Visitor Center is greatly in need of refurbishment: upgrading and updating of the centers facilities, interpretive exhibits, and information services are urgent concerns.  The trend in visitation has been increasing over the years, and in 2009, the Visitor Center hosted nearly 45,000 guests (almost three-quarter of million people visited the Park) and netted over $41,000 in snack and souvenir sales. Visitation and sales are expected to continue to increase in coming years.
Sources should submit statements showing ability as a prime contactor (designer, constructor, or integrated firm) of an experienced and established design-build team including architectural/engineering, interior design, exhibit design, and construction services on similar commercial buildings of a retail/educational/ or recreational nature.
Should you be interested in this requirement, please submit a capability package to Meagan Fyffe at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than December 2, 2010, 3:00 PM PST.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above and the offeror's ability to meet the qualification requirements with this type of work.   It should also describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (HUBZone or Service-Disabled veteran small business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether a HUBzone or Service-Disabled Veteran Small Business set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Meagan Fyffe/LC-10100, Contracting Officer, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail mfyffe@usbr.gov.  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR OTHER SOLICITATION, AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES CMS TO AWARD A CONTRACT. THE SOLE INTENT IS TO OBTAIN CAPABILITIES FOR AN <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8(a) SET-ASIDE ONLY</span></strong> AND PROCUREMENT PLANNING PURPOSES.
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>The services required are to be provided by a contractor with experience analyzing specific criteria and determining how the information may be audited.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) was enacted in February 2009. Included in the Recovery Act is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act. The main goal of the HITECH Act is to improve the nation's health care through the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and promotion of the meaningful use of EHR via incentive payments. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expects that "meaningful EHR users" would demonstrate each of the following: meaningful use of a certified EHR, the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care, and reporting on clinical quality and other measures using certified EHR technology.</p>
<p>In the early stages of meaningful use, Eligible Professionals (EPs) and Eligible Hospitals (EHs) will attest that they are meaningful users of EHRs. Upon attestation, they will be eligible to receive an incentive payment.</p>
<p>CMS is currently developing an audit process for HITECH. A contractor is needed to analyze the HITECH meaningful use criteria, and assist CMS to develop an effective audit process. The audit review process will include the clinical measures, as well as the determination that the EP or EH has a certified system, and is properly using it.</p>
<p>More information regarding HITECH on the CMS website at www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms, and the final rule, which contains the meaningful use criteria, is at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-17207.pdf.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions to the requirements listed below; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such capabilities, assets and experience will not be given further consideration.</p>
<p>Give enough detail so your response clearly indicates that you can provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Capability to analyze the HITECH meaningful use criteria and determine how the criteria may be reviewed/audited.</p>
<p>&bull; Capability to determine if there are existing data sources that can be leveraged in order to assist in the review process. This will include a review of CMS and vendor systems. <br />&bull; Capability to develop a process to determine if the EP or EH has a certified EHR system, and is using it properly.</p>
<p>&bull; Capability to develop a risk assessment of the proposed audit strategy, in order to determine which EPs and EHs may be reviewed, and which criteria may be focused on.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall have audit experience, including the process of determining how specific criteria may be audited. This includes review of clinical measures, as well as medical record review. Contractors will provide a list of contracts, minimum of three (3), with contract POC and telephone number, which demonstrate the required audit experience.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall have experience with CMS systems, and the CMS system lifecycle. Various communications and interfaces will be needed with HITECH and other systems. Contractors will provide a list of contracts, minimum of three (3), with contract POC and telephone number, which demonstrate the required CMS experience.</p>
<p>&bull; Capability in assisting CMS in the development of the audit protocol that will be used by the audit contractors(s). Note - the audit contractor will be a separate (subsequent) contract action.</p>
<p>&bull; The Government anticipates a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee or Fixed Price Contract with a 1-year base contract with 4 option years.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will provide documentation showing that their accounting system has been determined adequate by the Government. If so, please documentation from the agency that approved the system. (This documentation does not count against the page limitation.) NOTE: The use of a particular accounting system does not mean that the accounting system is adequate.</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Edward.rutherford@cms.hhs.gov . CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Please address each in order listed above.</p>
<p>Capability Statements shall be limited to 10 pages and shall include any/all teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall also include the following information:</p>
<p>a. DUNS # <br />b. Company Name <br />c. Company Address<br />d. Type of Company <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Must be certified as an 8(a) company.)</span></strong> All offerors must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp. <br />e. Company Point of Contact, Phone and Email address <br />f. Point of Contact, Phone and Email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted no later than <strong>12:00 PM EST, November 24, 2010.</strong> They should clearly reflect the respondent's ability to meet the requirements included in this notice. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of their submissions. Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential small business set-aside.</p>

This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. <br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, in conjunction with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is anticipating releasing a new solicitation for a single award of Phase IV of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). In the Phase IV contract, the contractor will be responsible for overall coordination and day-to-day management of the study; maintaining and updating a secure data base containing all study research and administrative records; provide liaison with appropriate state and federal offices necessary to conduct this research; appropriately communicate research findings to the cohort through a website and annual newsletter; and to collect specified biospecimens from selected study subjects. In Phase IV of the AHS, one contractor will perform all study related activities as there will be no cohort-wide interview conducted as part of this contract. The coordinating center will continue to be responsible for day-to-day study operations, managing and maintaining study data files, and coordinating National Advisory Panel meetings. In addition, the coordinating center will now assume responsibility for maintaining and securing the personal identifying information for cohort members; conducting annual linkages to the state cancer registries, state and federal mortality files, IRS address data bases; and facilitating add-on studies. New responsibilities under this contract will be the conduct of the Biomarker Study which will involve the collection of blood and urine samples from a subset of the cohort (approximate n=1,300) and creating a restricted access portal for all federal partners to document contract expenditures.<br /><br />The AHS cohort consists of approximately 52,000 private pesticide applicators (primarily farmers) and 32,000 spouses of private applicators from Iowa and North Carolina, as well as approximately 5,000 commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa. The pesticide applicators were recruited between 1993-1997, during Phase I of the AHS, when they obtained their license to apply restricted use pesticides; spouses were recruited largely by questionnaires brought home by the pesticide applicator. In addition to the extensive information on lifetime use of pesticides, demographic and other lifestyle factors were collected from all participants at enrollment using self-administered questionnaires (during Phase I of the AHS). Two follow-up telephone interviews have been conducted since enrollment. The first follow-up interview was conducted from 1999 to 2003 (during Phase II of AHS), and the second follow-up interview was conducted from 2005-2009 (during Phase III of the AHS). Cancer incidence has been ascertained by annual linkage to the cancer registries in each state and mortality through linkage to the National Death Index since the inception of the study field work in 1993. <br /><br />The AHS began field work for Phase I of the study with three contracts in 1993. One contract was for a coordinating center which was primarily responsible for overall coordination of the study, developing questionnaires, and providing a secure computer system to store the vast amount of questionnaire and other research data coming from the field stations in Iowa and North Carolina. The other two contracts were for a field station in Iowa and a second field station in North Carolina. Field Stations were primarily responsible for managing the distribution and retrieval of self-administered questionnaires to eligible study subjects. The coordinating center contract was awarded, via a full and open competition, to SRA Technologies for Phase II of the study and to Westat Inc. for Phase III of the study. Westat assumed the coordinating center contract during Phase II when SRA Technologies went out of business.

<SUBJECT>12--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for new Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) Common Array Block (CAB) Family of Antennas (FoA)
<SOLNBR>N0002411R5207
<RESPDATE>123110
<ARCHDATE>11152011

Cassie Trobaugh, 202-781-1426
<DESC>BACKGROUND: CEC is a high bandwidth, fire control communications network, linking surface ships, E2C and E2D aircraft, USA JLENS Aerostats and USMC ground nodes to pass high quality radar targeting information.  Directional, active phased array antennas are utilized to communicate between systems using a Time Division Pair-wise Access (TDPA) technique.  The current antenna systems use 1990s technologies, are experiencing some obsolescence issues, and are expensive to build.  Also, there is minimal hardware commonality between the different antennas currently in use.  The Integrated Warfare System (IWS) program office for CEC Program Executive Office , Program Management Office (PMO) for CEC, PEO IWS 6.0 and Marine Corps Systems Command seek to leverage new Gallium Nitride (GaN) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies and develop common antenna building blocks for use in multiple antenna designs for the primary purpose of improving affordability.
  The intent of this RFI is to gather the information from industry to determine potential sources for the design and development of the CAB solution.  The initial thrust of the development will be for the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Common Array Block-Expeditionary (CAB-E)  antenna and the United States Navy (USN) Common Array Block-Ship antenna (CAB-S).  Future efforts will consider extension of the Common Array Block Modules to Airborne applications in a USN Common Array Block-Air (CAB-A) design.  

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The basic building block for these antennas will be a Transmit/Receive (T/R) MMIC, which will be provided by the government in sample quantities.  This T/R MMIC is currently being designed and built via a separate contract.
  This T/R MMIC is GaN on Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology.  Included in the T/R MMIC are the power amp (~15 W up to CW duty), Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), 6-bit phase shifter, 6-bit attenuator and gain blocks.  Circulator and limiter functionality are not included in the T/R MMIC.  There are plans to add level shifters on chip for control inputs. Shift registers to allow a serial control interface are planned be added later.  The predicted size of the chip is 7 x 3.5 mm.  The contractor for the antenna designs will provide inputs for the MMIC second foundry spin.

It is envisioned that the contractor will utilize the T/R MMIC and develop a multi-channel T/R module as one of the common building blocks for the FoA.
  The contractor will be responsible for defining the remaining common subsystems for the CAB FoA.  It is understood that the enclosures and the packaging will be different for the different platforms, but maximizing use of common components while minimizing non-common subsystems is a requirement.  In addition to common array blocks for the design, the antenna will need to be extensible/scalable for potential future enhancements.  These may include:

	Multiple beams on transmit
	Pattern nulling on receive
	Dynamic aperture allocation

If a Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued , the antenna specifications for each platform will be provided as part of the RFP process.  Salient characteristics of the antenna systems will include:

	Transmit EIRP (low, medium and high power levels)
	Receive gain and noise figure
	Sidelobe levels and beamwidth
	VSWR
	Omni receive mode
	BIT and BITE
	Size and weight
	Ambient air cooled
	Reliability, maintainability
	Marine and ground mobile environments

This RFI is seeking innovative concepts and technologies for the next-generation of CEC shipboard and expeditionary antennas.
  These antennas will be required to be low-cost and built with a common set of subassemblies that would also be scalable to other configurations.  The shipboard antenna will be required to meet existing platform interface requirements necessitating a 4-face planar array configuration.  The expeditionary antenna will be mast mounted and must meet USMC mobility requirements.  Both antennas will be required to communicate with existing antennas systems and meet existing performance requirements.  These antennas are required to be ambient air cooled. The antennas will also be required to interface with the CEC signal data processor (SDP) for control, BIT/BITE and RF (via fiber optic). 

Respondents are asked to identify their specific experience in the development of active phased array antenna systems.
  Of particular interest is experience in the areas of low-cost fabrication techniques, integration of bare-die RF MMICs, EMI/EMC management, Radar Cross Section (RCS) signature suppression, reliability, mixed signal PCB design and thermal management.

The Government would have Government Purpose Rights (GPR) to all Data relating to all items, components or processes produced under this effort and at least partially funded by the Government.   Additionally, the Government would also like to have GPR to any other Data relating to the antenna design that the Government deems necessary for design and manufacture of the antenna.  Furthermore, the Government would also like to obtain licenses to all intellectual property used in the design and manufacture of the antenna so as to allow the Government unconstrained use of the intellectual property.

RESPONSES: Responses may be submitted in hard copy or electronic format.
  A security clearance is required for this work effort, so only vendors possessing a minimum of a Secret Clearance should submit a response to this RFI.  Recommended page limit for responses is 25 pages and must include: A) Industry Points of Contact (POC): one for technical and one for contractual issues to include name, position, telephone and email of each. B) General system description of concepts. C) Prior experience with MMICs and active arrays including synopses of previous projects. D) Description of production and test capabilities. E) Description of key personnel involved in the design and development of the product.

SUMMARY: This market research will be managed by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District Contracting Division, has a requirement for work in Wahpeton, North Dakota, and is seeking interested sources from HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns that are  both capable of providing the specialized work required and have the capability to obtain bonding.  The Statement of Work is as follows:<BR><BR>Wahpeton 3B is the final stage of the Wahpeton Flood Reduction Project for the City of Wahpeton, North Dakota. The upstream (south) end of the project is at the south end of Chahinkapa Park. The project extends to the north through the city's park, zoo, and golf course and ties into high ground east of the cul de sac at 17th Avenue North. Major features of the project include levee construction, a road raise, stability berms, and trench drains.<BR><BR>Levee construction is required over a 3,600 foot reach that ties into the existing levee north of the golf course club house and extends to the north to tie into high ground east of the cul de sac at 17th Avenue North. Most of this new levee is located in the golf course. Because of this levee's location, the contractor will need to complete the required work while minimizing the impact to the golf course. The site is readily accessible and the borrow source is located between the levee and the river channel. Over most of this reach the levee is one to three feet in height. Work required for levee construction includes stripping topsoil, excavation of an inspection trench, typically three feet deep or less, placement of impervious fill, placement of topsoil and seeding the finished surface of the levee. <BR><BR>A 600 foot long portion of Hughes Drive will have to be raised where the road crosses the new levee. Work will include demolition of bituminous pavement, removal of aggregate base, removal of unsatisfactory material, levee construction and placement of new aggregate base and bituminous pavement.<BR><BR>Stability berms will be required on the riverward side of the levee in two locations in the park. One reach is approximately 260 feet long while the other is 760 feet long. Work includes dressing the slope and placing riprap and bedding. Additionally, some shaping/removal of levee fill will be required on portions of the levee above the top of rock elevation.<BR><BR>Three trench drains will be required to be constructed on the landward portion of the existing levee in the park and zoo. The total length of these drains is approximately 3,800 feet. The drains will be two feet wide with variable height but typically in the range of 10 feet. The drains will consist of sand with an 8 inch diameter perforated pipe with a geotextile sock placed in the center of the drain close to its top. <BR><BR>The main concerns with the trench drains are related to potential challenges for construction. The drains are, for the most part, to be constructed under the landward slope of the existing levee in the park and zoo. Due to the existing levee heights along the drain alignments and the depths required for the base of the drains, the total depth of excavation to the base of the drains may be on the order of 20 feet. Removal of overburden on the order of 10 feet may be required just to get to the top of the drain. <BR><BR>Due to the location of the levee in the park and zoo, site features such as structures, fencing, walkways, etc. may encroach into the work area further impacting construction. Factors such as temporary stockpiling of overburden and excavation to a safe slope could be impacted. <BR><BR>The ability to construct the drain with a uniform thickness of two feet with vertical excavation walls could be impacted by variables such as strength of subsurface soils and the depth of groundwater. Should it be necessary to over excavate to provide a stable slope for placement of the sand drain, it becomes more difficult to backfill the excavation and keep the quantity for the sand drain to a minimum. <BR><BR>One potential construction method to minimize the excavation would be to use a trenching machine that could excavate a two foot width and place the sand for the drain in one operation. However, construction of a two foot wide trench drain would require a very large trenching machine, which may be difficult to obtain. Also, the placement of the perforated pipe near the top of the drain may difficult to do using this method.<BR><BR>The estimated magnitude for this project is between $1 million and $5 million.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.<BR><BR>This is not a request for proposals, but instead market research to determine interested HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern sources prior to issuing a solicitation.    A determination by the Government on the method of competing this requirement has not been established.  The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice or the information received, nor will it reimburse participants for the information they provide.  If you are an interested HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern, please provide the following information:  1). Small business name and Point of Contact; 2). DUNS number and CAGE code; 3). Evidence of HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern status; and 4). A brief Statement of Capability (no more than 10 pages) which demonstrates the ability to meet the specialized work requirements specified in the above Statement of Work as well as the concerns bonding capability.  Include any past performance information on contracts of similar size and scope, and indicate the degree of work self-performed.  Also include past performance references with names and phone numbers.  Electronic responses are preferred and telephonic requests for information will not be honored.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice.  Information provided will not be used as a part of any subsequent solicitation requirement.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses are due no later than 2:00 p.m., Central Standard Time, on Tuesday, November 22, 2010, to the attention of Patricia Simon, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to patricia.m.simon@usace.army.mil or by fax to 651-290-5706.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>LOGISTICS DEMAND REDUCTION (LDR)
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

Introduction

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither MCWL nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

During July 2010, MCWL completed experimentation in support of Enhanced Company Operations (ECO).  In this Limited Objective Experiment (LOE), doctrinal, organizational, training, manning, and equipping concepts and technologies were tested and evaluated with the goal of promoting sustained independent operations of infantry-centric Company Landing Teams (CLTs).
  

Current experimentation is in support of Enhanced Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO).  MCWL is researching concepts and technologies that can best support CLTs from a sea base, by reducing logistics demands and increasing resupply distribution efficiency.  The objective is the overall reduction of power, fuel, water, and waste requirements of CLTs operating ashore, and more effective concepts for timely, tailored resupply sustainment from the sea base operating over the horizon.

The purpose of this RFI is to inform MCWL of concepts and technologies relevant to logistics demand reduction and improved sustainment efficiency.  

Submissions shall address concepts and technologies that could result in:
1.	Expeditionary power demand reduction at the CLT-level.
2.	Expeditionary fuel demand reduction at the CLT-level.
3.	Improved CLT-level power generation, distribution, storage, and management.
4.	Improved CLT-level tactical water production and storage.
5.	Tailored (i.e.
 shock-absorbant, flexible configuration, safe, secure) packaging for unmanned aerial resupply delivery
6.	Improved sea-based water testing, tactical packaging, storage, and distribution.
7.	Waste reduction, minimized storage, and disposal for CLTs operating ashore.
 
The intent of this RFI is to assist MCWL in investigating potential candidate concepts, key and enabling technologies, and technology development efforts that can reduce logistics demands and aid in MAGTF-level sustainment delivery from the sea base directly to the CLTs.

Response, Submittal and Instructions
Questions pertaining to this notice are requested to be submitted by email to Teri Snyder at teri.snyder@usmc.mil.  The deadline for submission of questions concerning this notice is 8 December 2010 by 4:00pm EST.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for Veterans Guest Internet Access (VGIA).  This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas, initiatives, and/or processes related to this request.

VGIA seeks to provide wireless internet access to veterans and their families in medical centers.  This wireless internet access should be separate from the medical center's network.  

The VA is seeking Contractor support to provide unrestricted wireless internet access (802.11b/g/n access points and in room internet access to guests) in multiple locations (within the continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines).   The Contractor shall also take into account public and private security, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Compliance, User authentication, physical security of equipment, physical cable horizontal runs, information security (disclaimer on security limitations) and support and maintenance to include a 24 hour/365 days per year technical support through a call center for VHA medical centers utilizing this wireless service.  Additionally, the vendor shall provide on-site support when required.  

The period of performance for this effort will be based upon each Medical Centers needs.  In general we expect a base period of 12 months with option years.

In the event VA proceeds to a formal request for proposals, VA reserves the right to consider alternative engagement models.

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

If interested, please submit a Capabilities Statement, limited to ten (10) pages for your company, your teammates and or subcontractors and also denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517210 Wireless Telecommunication Carriers.  Please include company name, company address, and DUNS Number (if applicable).  Also, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or a Veteran Owned Small Business.

Respondents should address the following questions: 

1. Does your company possess the capabilities to independently provide some or all of the services described above?  If not, please describe your team/subcontracting arrangements and/or approach.

2. How would your company propose providing the services?

3. Is your company currently providing similar solutions to another government agency or other non-government customer?  If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer.

<p>This service will be used by Cadets, Faculty and Staff to support chemistry classroom research and courses. The service can be integrated into classroom instruction allowing greater flexibility, individual student interactions and more precise searching than could be possible with printed resources.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. If no response is received by November 22, 2010 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with the American Chemical Society a sole source award will be made.</p>

<CONTACT>Edward A. Langwinski, Contracting Officer, Phone 2564501412, Email edward.langwinski@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) releases the attached Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) pursuant to a competitive Objective Simulation Framework (OSF) contract to enhance its current suite of modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks.  The current frameworks (the Digital Simulation Architecture [DSA] and the Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) integrate models from each of the BMDS program elements into a system that accurately represents the performance of fielded BMDS equipment against a variety of threats in realistic environments.  The desired framework, hereafter called Objective Simulation Framework (OSF), will leverage existing or mature capabilities, develop common interfaces, or propose a combination of both, to join digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) representations into a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and compose-able system.  Contractors are encouraged to submit comments/questions regarding all of the documents provided herein.  The closing date for receipt of comments/questions is 23 August 2010.  For further information regarding this DRFP, reference the attached OSF Contracting Officer Summary Letter located in the Files Section herein.

MDA will conduct Industry Days 9-13 August 2010 at Building 5222, Martin Road, Von Braun II, in Redstone Arsenal, AL to discuss the OSF DRFP in order to enhance the Government solicitation documents and Contractor proposal preparations/submittals.  To attend the Industry Days, interested Contractors must register via an email entitled OSF DRFP Industry Days sent to OSFCompetition@mda.mil using the OSF Industry Day 2 Registration Form found in the Files Section located herein not later than 4 August 2010.  Attendance is limited to three (3) representatives per Contractor.  A Plenary Session will be held from 1300-1730 on 9 August 2010 with Contractors offered the opportunity to schedule a one-on-one meeting with the Government from 10-13 August 2010.  Requests for one-on-one meetings must be submitted with your registration forms.  Scheduling dates and times of the one-on-ones will be at the Government's discretion.  Additional instructions, registration requirements and site location directions are provided in the the Files Section herein.  Please be aware that Visitor Authorization Requests (VARs) are required to attend the Industry Days since Von Braun II is a classified facility.  VARs must be received by 4 August 2010.

Contractors desiring responses to specific questions/comments at the Industry Days must submit their questions/comments no later than 4 August 2010 to OSFCompetition@mda.mil.

The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by potential offerors, i.e., any given contractor can propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the Government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest.

Release of this DRFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government will NOT pay any costs incurred as a result of this release.  Questions/Comments should be emailed to OSFCompetition@mda.mil and entitled OSF Comments/Questions.

Please be advised that all communications concerning this acquisition (including, but not limited to, management/technical issues, pricing issues, administration issues, and proposal issues) must be coordinated through the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) Mr. Edward Langwinski who may be contacted at OSFCompetition@mda.mil or at Edward.Langwinski@mda.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole-Source Basis
<p>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of the FAR 6.302-1 with Systems Research and Applications Corporation (SRA) to provide technical and analytical support to the U.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Compliance and Innovative Strategies Division (CISD) for an additional one (1) month period beginning on 01/01/2011 with an option to extend an additional one (1) month period.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide support in the following areas:</p>
<p>A - Economic, Environmental, Statistical, Financial, and Evaluative Analysis and Support</p>
<p>B - Technical and Engineering Analysis</p>
<p>C - Communication, outreach, Guidance, and Regulatory Program Support</p>
<p>D - Web, Computer System, and Database Support Development</p>
<p>E- Support for Implementation and Compliance Monitoring of Air Pollution Regulations and Programmatic Requirements</p>
<p>EPA believes that Systems Research and Applications Corporation, with its experience in working the current contract, is uniquely qualified for this short term additional effort and the only responsible source because it possesses the resources and personnel to support OTAQ projects. The current projects are on-going and need support during the transition period until the new contract is awarded.</p>

<DESC>Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP)<BR>W900KK-10-R-0034<BR>Request for Information #5<BR><BR>15 April 2010<BR><BR><BR>Closing Date: 29 April 2010<BR><BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS); Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) in partnership with the Yuma Test Center (YTC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR),  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), and Redstone Test Center (RTC) will be creating a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) Time Space Position Information (TSPI) object model for the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP).  PM ITTS is the lead for this capability and is seeking industry information and input on data attributes to be included in the Instrumentation Radar TENA TSPI object model.   <BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>The Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) developed a common architecture and requisite software to integrate testing, training, simulation, and high-performance computing technologies, distributed across many facilities. Through the establishment of a common architecture, the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), reuse and interoperability of range assets will be tremendously improved, thus reducing range development, operation, and maintenance costs.<BR><BR>TENA promotes interoperability and reusability among DoD ranges, facilities, and simulations and advances a simulation-based acquisition or a distributed engineering plant methodology to streamline weapon system acquisition. Once the TENA capabilities are in use by the test and training communities, future inter-range operations, as well as instrumentation development and sustainment, will cost less and incur less risk. Most impressively, upgrading an existing range system to TENA takes only a few days, drastically shorter than traditional software integration efforts. Additional benefits from the TENA products include cost-effective replacement of unique range protocols, enhanced exchange of mission data, and organic TENA compliant capabilities.<BR><BR>More information can be found on TENA at http://www.tena-sda.org.<BR><BR>This object model will be used for instrumentation radars in the close-in and fly-out zones of the Range Radar Replacement Program.<BR><BR>The Governments intention is to better understand what additional information would be beneficial for the Instrumentation Radar TSPI object model.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  There is no limit on your formal white paper submission including cover letter and white paper.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments that consists of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.  Electronic responses shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format.  Please submit responses to PEOSTRI, ATTN: SFAE-STRI-KOT (Mrs. Marialyn Achille-Argaez), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or e-mail m.achilleargaez@us.army.mil . Please include Mr. Anthony Aldrich, Project Director ( anthony.j.aldrich@us.army.mil ) on the cc:line.  Information must be received no later than 11:59 P.M. EDT 29 April 2010.  Point of contact is Mrs. Marialyn Achille-Argaez at 407 208-3481 or m.achilleargaez@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Detailed Requirements:<BR><BR>PM ITTS is looking for information and input on what additional data or attributes would be beneficial to contain in the TENA TSPI object model that will be used for instrumentation radars in the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP).

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC <br />*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>

The estimated length and mean width of the each tributary are:  Threemile Creek = 3 mile at 2m, Little Meadow Creek = 14 mile at 2m, Lucille Creek = 12 mile at 1-2m, Fish Creek = 13 mile at 5 - 10m, and Meadow Creek = 6 mile at 1-5m.  In addition, imagery will be taken on four minor tributaries that flow directly into the Little Meadow Creek tributary; North Fork Little Meadow Creek, Twin Lake Creek, Jim Creek, and Railroad Creek.  Estimated mileage and mean width of these tributaries is North Fork = 1 mile at 2m, Twin Lake = 0.5 mile at 2 m, Jim = 0.3 mile at 1 m, and Railroad = 0.5 mile at 1 m.  See Figure 2.  Note these lengths are estimated.  
Maps of the project area can be found at:  http://filedownloads.fws.gov/ftp_R7CGS.   Look at file #F11PS00088.
 A summary of the mileage is in the below table.   In total, the TIR imagery will cover approximately 50 miles of stream within the Big Lake Basin with varying stream widths.

Project timing and location: The TIR imagery should occur in the fall when leaf foliage of surrounding vegetation is absent and minimal surface flows are lowest in these systems.  Exact timing will vary due to weather conditions and will likely occur between September and November.  Acquisition of TIR imagery should document both major and minor tributaries at a 1 to 5 meter resolution within the Big Lake Basin.  	Table 2. Anticipated schedule for Big Lake Basin TIR imagery.Process	Anticipated ScheduleTIR imagery/Data 	September - November 2011Preliminary Reports	Monthly Final Report	No later than April 31, 2012	Instrumentation: Collect image data with a TIR radiometer and a true color digital camera.  TIR camera shall have a scientific-grade long wave infrared (8-9) sensor.	In-stream Monitoring: The contractor will submit their proposed location of the continuous in-stream data loggers to the AFWFO for approval prior to deployment. It is the responsibility of the vendor to install, purchase, and maintain the data loggers during image acquisition.  These in-stream data loggers will be used to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the TIR images. 	Data Acquisition:  The contractor will determine actual flight lines, speeds, and altitudes prior to the mission and enter this data into navigational software on-board the aircraft.  Given the fixed focal length of the TIR sensor, the mission should be planned to optimize ground coverage while maintaining the desired spatial resolution of the imagery.  Data acquisition shall be planned to collect images sequentially with 40% or greater vertical overlap.  Thermal infrared images shall be recorded directly from the sensor to an on-board computer as raw counts, which can then be converted to radiance values. The individual images shall be referenced with time, Global Positioning System (GPS) position data, and aircraft attitude.	Data Processing:  Once calibrated, the contractor will integrate the images into a Geographic Information System (GIS) from which AFWFO can interpret and sample stream temperatures.  Sampling shall consist of querying radiant temperatures (pixel values) from the center of the stream channel and saving the median value of a ten-point sample to a GIS database file.  The temperatures of detectable surface inflows (i.e., surface springs, tributaries, confluences) shall also be sampled at their mouths.  There are a number of small order streams (less than a meter in width and of minimal length) flowing into the major and minor tributaries; however, the AFWFO would not characterize these as stream mouths.  Stream mouths do exist where major tributaries from a confluence or major and minor tributaries form a confluence.  These confluences shall be monitored with in-stream data loggers.  During sampling, interpretations of the spatial variations in surface temperatures observed in the images shall be provided.	The contractor shall plot the median temperatures for each sampled image versus the corresponding river mile to develop a longitudinal temperature profile.  The profile will illustrate how stream temperatures vary spatially along the stream gradient.  The location and median temperature of all sampled surface water inflows (e.g., tributaries, surface springs, etc.) shall be included on the plot to illustrate how these inflows influence the main stem temperature patterns.	The contractor will tag the images with a GPS position at the time they are acquired in order to provide an accurate index to the location of the image scene.  In order to provide further spatial reference, the contractor shall assign a river mile base to the TIR images based on a routed stream layer.  The image frame locations and geographic coordinates shall be stored in a GIS compatible file (i.e., ESRI shapefile).	Method Evaluation: 	Contractor should provide information about their steps or monitoring to ensure proper operation of the instruments, in-flight control plans, and quality and backup of resulting data.  The contractor is to provide information on relevant past performance and technical processes. The contractor's proposal should contain a price/mile estimate that includes data acquisition and image processing and analysis.  A schedule indicating the anticipated time frame for acquisition and reporting should also be included.  	BASE QUOTE Deliverables:1)TIR- Sequence of overlapping (seamless) digital TIR images of the study area.2) Verification of Radiant Accuracy - In-stream temperature data collected during the time frame of the TIR survey will verify radiant temperature accuracy.  Target radiant accuracy should be approximately 0.5oC.3) Flight log - Flight log (GIS-compatible file) containing the name and geographic location of each image frame.4) Longitudinal Profile - Excel spreadsheet containing the longitudinal temperature profile, showing the stream and tributary temperatures versus river mile.5) Observation and Analysis - Interpretation of the imagery highlighting major findings of conservation value to fish, and an analysis of the longitudinal profile will be provided in the final report.6) Report - A comprehensive report, detailing methodology, longitudinal profile, observations, accuracy, results, and analysis of the TIR imagery (electronic and hard copy versions).7) Geo-Rectified Image Mosaics - Continuous geo-rectified mosaic of TIR images over some or all of the survey extent. The projection will match the specifications of existing color digital orthophotos.8) Polyline Shapefile - A polyline shapefile of all waterways greater than or equal to 1 m in width within the Big Lake Basin.  	
Line 0002- OPTION QUOTE Description:  Digital high-resolution true-color ortho-photography of the study area described above. This option quote is to be included in the quote as a separate price. The location and schedule are the same as the base quote (above). The government MAY choose to exercise this option at the time of award. 
Instrumentation:  Ortho-photography of the study area shall be taken in conjunction with thermal imagery.  Visible cameras should cover the same ground area as thermal imagery.  
Data Acquisition:  High-resolution imagery (0.20 - 0.40 m) covering the entire channel and georeferenced to the study area.  Vendor will design a flight plan that captures the width of the active channel at a high spatial resolution and avoids image blur.   Images should have a minimum of 40% overlap.  
Data Processing:  Individual frames should be georeferenced by finding a minimum of three common ground control points between the true color images and existing digital orthophoto quads.  OPTION QUOTE Deliverables:1)Sequence of overlapping (seamless) digital images of the study area.2) Georeferenced (0.20 -0.40 m accuracy and approximate 3 inch pixel resolution) true color digital images mosaic'd into 1-mile river segments. Digital images and TIR images should be georeferenced.3) Digital color (3-band, 24-bit with 8-bit unsigned pixel depth per band) with no "No-data" areas.Images should be NAD83 with appropriate Alaska UTM.4)Report - A comprehensive report, detailing methodology, observations, accuracy, results, and analysis of the imagery (electronic and hard copy versions).  Can be included with TIR report.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability, which consists of demonstrated capability and experience to provide the services required by the Specifications.
<p>2. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b.

Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than 01 DEC 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Therefore, interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this solicitation.</p>
<p>AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C)(1), JUSTIFICATION: SUPPLIES REQUIRED ARE FROM ONLY ONE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESPONSIBLE SOURCE(S) AND NO OTHER TYPE OF SUPPLIES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.<br />THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES AND SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLCIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE, OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SOURCES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.301-1. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

<p>This acquisition is to procure&nbsp; (175) Themis Assy, SUPIIe, 1024 MB Memory Modules (MFR# 31-110165-005) which are essential to the System Server Unit (SSU).</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br /><br />Themis USPIIIi is a VME SPARC Single Board Computer (SBC) that is a critical component to the MCE S/W program. Recent MCE S/W enhancements exceeded the current on board memory capacity and memory upgrade was required to maintain operational capabilities. Due to the proprietary nature of the Themis SBC, only the Themis name brand memory is approved and known to be functionally compatible. The USPIIe-USB memory modules are custom designed for Themis. These modules meet the physical constraints of the USPIIe motherboard they plug into. The module design electrically follows the Sun memory interface, but mechanically is specific to the USPIIe board. There are no off-the-shelf or third party modules that meet the physical requirements. The Themis memory modules are the only ones to meet the system performance specification. The increase in memory is to allow us to process data faster with a greater through put to the Operation Module. It allows us to communicate with other Tactical Air Operations Modules (TAOM). If the TAOM cannot perform its primary function then the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) is at risk. If the Operations Module is unable to perform its mission then the Air Control Squadron will not be functional. <br /><br />The custom memory modules are designed only for the ThemisUSPIIe-USB boards. The memory modules are shape and form fit only for the<br />Themis USPIIe-USB boards. The Themis Memory Modules are proprietary and are the only brand approved to be functionally compatible. <br /><br />Themis is the only Brand acceptable to the Government. No other Brand will meet the government needs.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

<DESC>Questions and Answers Pertaining to the Scientific Visualization Studio Support RFIposted November 8, 2010. The due date for responses has not changed.Question #1 - Interested Organizations are invited to submit "a description of theircapability to provide personnel to create very quality visualizations of the Earth andSpace Science data".  What is really meant by this requirement?  Is NASA asking forcopies of resume of the candidates with Earth and Science data visualization experienceincluded in the capability statement?  Would NASA accept an offeror's capability toprovide such candidates through an existing or a future agreement with a recruiting /staffing company / database ( such as DICE.com or Monster.com)?Please clarify the extent of offeror's capability to provide science data visualizationpersonnel.Answer #1: Personnel on this project must have a background in some combination ofscientific visualization, computer graphics, physical science, graphic design, andprogramming and should have used that background to create scientific visualization ofthe quality seen on science programs such as 'NOVA', in planetariums and museums, and inthe public media.  Since this is a specialized area, it will necessary for the offeror toprovide documentation and examples of experience in this area so that the quality of thework and/or experience can be assessed.Question #2- Who are all the incumbents supporting the subject work now?  What are theircontract numbers?Answer #2: The incumbent is Global Science and Technology, under subcontract to NorthropGrumman Information Technology through the GSA Millennia Contract GS00T99ALD0207, OrderNumber NNG06HN01D.Question #3- It seems that NASA GSFC is looking for offerors with personnel who arealready using the listed commercial software tools in its Earth and Science data displayand visualization environment (laboratory).  This seems to be a very much closerequirement that can only be met by the incumbent or the other few contractors who aredirectly supporting the SIVO.  Could NASA relax this requirement to an extent that somesmall businesses can meet the capability requirement criteria?Answer #3:  The NASA GSFC Scientific Visualization Studio has an in-house system torender visualizations that is similar to those in the animation and special effectsindustry, i.e., a system/cluster of Linus and MacOS X workstations, file servers, andrender servers coupled with commercial software for design ('MAYA'), rendering('RenderMan'), and scheduling ('Alfred').  This commercial software is highly extensiblethrough modular add-ons and ad-hoc programming in MEL, SLIM, and RenderMan ShadingLanguage.  The SVS has created a unique capability by extending this system in-house withmodules to produce scientific visualizations.  Personnel with experience using suchsoftware for animation design and rendering and modifying such software as necessaryshould be able to learn this system.  In addition, the SVS team is more extensive thanjust the personnel on this contract, and the entire SVS team, civil servants andcontractors alike, collaborate using this system.Question #4- The requirement for converting the science data retrieved from the archivesto formats compatible with "system described above" again restricts the subject work tothe incumbents only or those directly working with SIVO.  Could NASA relax thisrequirement in such a way to also allow non-SIVO supporting companies to meet someminimum capability requirements?Answer #4: The formats compatible with the SVS system are straightforward, usuallyfloating-point tiffs and ascii files.  The key issue here is knowledge of existingscientific data formats such as HDF, NetCDF, ArcGIS, generic binary, etc., and theprocesses by which that data can be converted to other formats through existing tools orad hoc programming.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

Please note the new date for submissions is November 22, 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></strong>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to acquire a "continuation" of services currently being performed by the University California, San Francisco (UCSF) under Contract N01-AG-6-2106).</p>
<p>The purpose of the HEALTH ABC Study is to characterize the extent of change in body composition in older men and women, identify clinical conditions accelerating these changes, and examine the health impact of these changes on strength, endurance, disability, and weight-related diseases of old age. The study population consists of 3,075 persons age 70-79 at baseline with about equal numbers of men and women. Thirty-three percent of the men are African-Americans as are 46% of the women. All persons in the study were selected to be free of disability in activities of daily living and free of functional limitation (defined as any difficulty walking a quarter of a mile or any difficulty walking up 10 steps without resting) at baseline.</p>
<p>The principal goals of the HEALTH ABC are:</p>
<p>To assess the association of baseline body weight, lean body mass, body fat, and bone mineral content, in relation to weight history, with:<br /><br />1. incident functional limitation <br />2. incidence and change in severity of weight- related health conditions <br />3. recovery of physical function after an acute event <br />4. baseline measures of strength, fitness and physical performance <br />5. gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status</p>
<p>&#61607; To access the contribution of episodes of severe acute illness in healthier older persons to changes in body weight, bone mineral content, lean body mass and body fat, and the relationship of these episodes to risk of functional limitation and recovery.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the impact of weight-related co-morbid illness on the risk of functional limitation and recovery.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the ways in which physiologic mediators of change in body composition influence and are influenced by changes in health in older adults and contribute to change in body composition; to understand how changes in body composition affect weight-related cardiovascular disease risk factors such as lipids, blood pressure and glucose tolerance.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the interdependency of behavioral factors, such as nutrition and physical activity, co-morbid health conditions, and their association with change in body composition in old age.<br /><br />&bull; To provide a firm scientific basis for understanding issues related to weight recommendations in old age through increased knowledge of the potential trade-offs between weight and risk of functional limitation, disability, morbidity and death; to provide information critical for developing effective strategies for the maintenance of health in older persons.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>&bull; The intramural Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB) has supported the clinical research study entitled the Dynamics of Health, Aging and Body Composition (HEALTH ABC) since 1997. This study, targeted to understanding the decline in function of healthier older persons, complements research efforts in prevention of functional decline for healthy and frail older persons by focusing on the substantial majority of older persons in transition from vigor to frailty.<br /><br />&bull; The major objectives of the HEALTH ABC Study relate to observations that change in body composition in old age, particularly the increase in body fat and the decline in lean mass and bone mineral, represent a common pathway by which multiple diseases contribute to disability. There are many unanswered questions regarding the patterns and health impact of changes in weight and body composition in old age. Weight generally increases over the lifetime until late middle age, then tends to decrease into old age with changes in muscle, fat and bone. It has been postulated that the accelerated loss of muscle and strength in old age contributes to the onset of disability. Studies of weight and its relationship to mortality in older persons have yielded contradictory findings, leading to controversy regarding public health recommendations for weight in old age. Few studies have examined weight-related morbidity in old age, especially among African-Americans.</p>
<p>Primary study tasks include:</p>
<p>A. Support of data collection activities of the Field Centers for 6-month telephone interviews and disease and death outcomes adjudication.<br />B. Data management, maintenance, and distribution of data files for 6-month telephone interviews, disease and death outcomes adjudication, and select other sources of data such an ancillary studies.<br />C. Participation in and administration of the activities of the Diagnosis and Disease Ascertainment Committee.<br />D. Participation in and administration of the publications review process, including the review of analysis proposals and manuscripts. <br />E. Participate in the scientific direction and progress of Health ABC, including administration of the Ancillary Study proposal review process.<br />F. Maintenance of biologic specimen repositories, including genetic material. <br />G. Information Technology Security Requirements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with change in body composition in older men and women, examination of the health impact of these changes on health and diseases of the old, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified health study; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful. Respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (4) responses should be received no later than November 1 , 2010 at 2:00 PM Local Time; (5) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (6) send responses to this notice via email to csager@mail.nih.gov The original statements mailed using the U.S. Postal Service should be sent to ATTN: Craig Sager, National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions - NIDA Neuroscience COAC, NIA R&amp;D Contracts Management Section, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 8154, MSC 9661, Bethesda, MD 20892-9661.

<DESC>Government Sources Sought Request for Information (RFI) for Expeditionary Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Neutralization System (EUNS).  The original Sources Sought, published on or about 1 November 2010, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS  

Description: The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) under the sponsorship of the Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare (PMS-408) is requesting information on small (two-person portable) unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) mine neutralization systems as part of an Analysis of Alternatives study. This study will focus on analyses of alternative systems to perform mine neutralization in three distinct mission areas: (1) A low observable system for use in non-permissive environments in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) zone with water depths from 10-60 feet to support the Concept of Operations (CONOP) to reduce the MCM tactical timeline.
 (2) A system which can operate in permissive environments in water depths from 60-300 feet in near shore areas including open areas of harbors and shipping channels. (3) A variant system which can operate in permissive environments in confined environments (e.g., harbors or ship channels) where neutralization with low resultant collateral damage is required due to proximity to critical infrastructure. Systems 2 and 3 will normally operate in support of the concept to reduce operator risk as described below.  Although intended to be employed in permissive environments, standoff between topside operators and subsystems, and in-water subsystems is required for employment in expeditionary operations where shore side and waterside activities may not always be under control of friendly forces.
  These systems will utilize known target information (location, depth, target type) acquired by precursor systems.  The current baseline comparative system employed by EOD Expeditionary Forces consists of EOD divers delivering a countercharge within neutralization range of the target.  

Any proposed platform (system) must possess the potential for addition of sensors, payloads, and command and control algorithms for future development efforts.  Notional Concepts for these systems include:

CONCEPT 1  Reduce risk to the operator by employing a robust, highly autonomous Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle (AUV), or a combination Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)-ROV solution capable of precision delivery, placement and aiming (if required) of neutralizers on previously localized, in-volume and bottom targets (including buried) for follow-on actuation.

CONCEPT 2  Reduce the tactical timeline in non-permissive pre-assault amphibious MCM environments, and rapid follow on MCM clearance environments by employing an expendable AUV neutralizer capable of autonomously reacquiring previously localized in-volume and bottom targets, and either automatically actuating upon arrival at the effective target location, or positioning itself in a manner that will enable effective mine neutralization upon directed actuation.

Responses to this market survey are due on or before 45 days from release of this RFI.
  Any proposed technically mature system must include a product description with current verified performance characteristics and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, summary of current use by other military/operational forces, and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  Test data and/or analytical predictions of systems ability to station keep on or near the target is desired.  Information on suitability of systems used by U.S. Navy, including: existing test data or reports and certifications as to whether energetic payloads qualify as insensitive munitions; and compliance with MIL-STD-882D systems safety requirements is also desired.
  Of particular interest are those systems which are sufficiently small and robust such that they can be easily assembled and launched by one or two persons from small inflatable boats in remote areas without the need for cranes, davits or other handling aids to support use in expeditionary operations.  

Any proposed system or concepts still under development should include an assessment of the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL), descriptions of risk areas and mitigation plans to achieve TRL 9, development schedule and estimated development and unit cost for test articles and future production units.  Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.   Telephone responses will not be honored.
 This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No further information is available from the contracting office.

Technical Questions and responses to this RFI should be directed to Paul Moser, e-mail: paul.moser@navy.mil, address: Paul Moser, Code E15, Naval Surface Warfare Panama City Division, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL  32407. Please send a copy of the response to this RFI to Mr. Phil Montgomery, e-mail: phillip.r.montgomery@navy.mil, address: Phil Montgomery, PMS-408 (EOD) MCM UUV Projects Manager , 2008 Stump Neck Rd., Indian Head, MD 20640 and to Stuart Burman, Contract Specialist, stuart.burman@navy.mil NSWC PCD Code B32.
  

In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned  a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the solicitation will be publicized and any subsequent award made in the Navy Seaporte portal. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District Contracting Division, has a requirement for work in Wahpeton, North Dakota, and is seeking interested sources from HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns that are both capable of providing the specialized work required and have the capability to obtain bonding. The Statement of Work is as follows:<br /><br />Wahpeton 3B is the final stage of the Wahpeton Flood Reduction Project for the City of Wahpeton, North Dakota. The upstream (south) end of the project is at the south end of Chahinkapa Park. The project extends to the north through the city's park, zoo, and golf course and ties into high ground east of the cul de sac at 17th Avenue North. Major features of the project include levee construction, a road raise, stability berms, and trench drains.<br /><br />Levee construction is required over a 3,600 foot reach that ties into the existing levee north of the golf course club house and extends to the north to tie into high ground east of the cul de sac at 17th Avenue North. Most of this new levee is located in the golf course. Because of this levee's location, the contractor will need to complete the required work while minimizing the impact to the golf course. The site is readily accessible and the borrow source is located between the levee and the river channel. Over most of this reach the levee is one to three feet in height. Work required for levee construction includes stripping topsoil, excavation of an inspection trench, typically three feet deep or less, placement of impervious fill, placement of topsoil and seeding the finished surface of the levee. <br /><br />A 600 foot long portion of Hughes Drive will have to be raised where the road crosses the new levee. Work will include demolition of bituminous pavement, removal of aggregate base, removal of unsatisfactory material, levee construction and placement of new aggregate base and bituminous pavement.<br /><br />Stability berms will be required on the riverward side of the levee in two locations in the park. One reach is approximately 260 feet long while the other is 760 feet long. Work includes dressing the slope and placing riprap and bedding. Additionally, some shaping/removal of levee fill will be required on portions of the levee above the top of rock elevation.<br /><br />Three trench drains will be required to be constructed on the landward portion of the existing levee in the park and zoo. The total length of these drains is approximately 3,800 feet. The drains will be two feet wide with variable height but typically in the range of 10 feet. The drains will consist of sand with an 8 inch diameter perforated pipe with a geotextile sock placed in the center of the drain close to its top. <br /><br />The main concerns with the trench drains are related to potential challenges for construction. The drains are, for the most part, to be constructed under the landward slope of the existing levee in the park and zoo. Due to the existing levee heights along the drain alignments and the depths required for the base of the drains, the total depth of excavation to the base of the drains may be on the order of 20 feet. Removal of overburden on the order of 10 feet may be required just to get to the top of the drain. <br /><br />Due to the location of the levee in the park and zoo, site features such as structures, fencing, walkways, etc. may encroach into the work area further impacting construction. Factors such as temporary stockpiling of overburden and excavation to a safe slope could be impacted. <br /><br />The ability to construct the drain with a uniform thickness of two feet with vertical excavation walls could be impacted by variables such as strength of subsurface soils and the depth of groundwater. Should it be necessary to over excavate to provide a stable slope for placement of the sand drain, it becomes more difficult to backfill the excavation and keep the quantity for the sand drain to a minimum. <br /><br />One potential construction method to minimize the excavation would be to use a trenching machine that could excavate a two foot width and place the sand for the drain in one operation. However, construction of a two foot wide trench drain would require a very large trenching machine, which may be difficult to obtain. Also, the placement of the perforated pipe near the top of the drain may difficult to do using this method.<br /><br />The estimated magnitude for this project is between $1 million and $5 million. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.<br /><br />This is not a request for proposals, but instead market research to determine interested HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern sources prior to issuing a solicitation. A determination by the Government on the method of competing this requirement has not been established. The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice or the information received, nor will it reimburse participants for the information they provide. If you are an interested HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern, please provide the following information: 1). Small business name and Point of Contact; 2). DUNS number and CAGE code; 3). Evidence of HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concern status; and 4). A brief Statement of Capability (no more than 10 pages) which demonstrates the ability to meet the specialized work requirements specified in the above Statement of Work as well as the concerns bonding capability. Include any past performance information on contracts of similar size and scope, and indicate the degree of work self-performed. Also include past performance references with names and phone numbers. Electronic responses are preferred and telephonic requests for information will not be honored. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Information provided will not be used as a part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses are due no later than 2:00 p.m., Central Standard Time, on Monday, November 22, 2010, to the attention of Patricia Simon, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to patricia.m.simon@usace.army.mil or by fax to 651-290-5706. <br /><br />
