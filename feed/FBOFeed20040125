In addition, Ukrainian banks and non-bank financial institutions will have a greater capacity to make business and home loans.  Award will be made using the procedures in FAR Part 15 under Full and Open Competition. The NAICS Code for the proposed award is 941990. The solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) no sooner than 15 days from the date of this notice. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued.
