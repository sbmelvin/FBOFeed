<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFOMRATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract to Verizon Business for continuing technical support to the International Satellite Communications System (ISCS) 2nd Generation (G2) Extended (e) network program. This support network includes dissemination of critical, time-sensitive, meteorological aviation products and meteorological, hydrological, and climatologic products to domestic and international users located in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean Regions. 
The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to award a non-competitive contract to Verizon Business, the existing ISCS satellite provider.  The FAA has determined that it is critical to continue work on an uninterrupted basis with Verizon Business until such time as the ISCS requirements are completed. To successfully finish these tasks, continuity of support is required. This award will allow the FAA to maintain continuity and consistency in transitioning from satellite broadcast to an internet file server.
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly. Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Vito Pietanza, Contracting Specialist by 10:00 A.M., Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, March 31, 2010. 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with submissions related to this announcement will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement for Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) systems engineering and development efforts.  This requirement is a part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program element (MDA/AB).  MDA intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), Tucson, Arizona, to provide the necessary engineering services and material for systems engineering, design, development, fabrication, test equipment, ground and flight tests, along with documentation support and assistance in the transition to production for the SM-3 program.  RMS, or its predecessors, have been the All Up Round Design Agent for all Standard Missile variants since 1966.  It is the only source that currently possesses the indepth technical knowledge of the system requirements to satisfactorily perform the work contemplated herein.  No other source has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise, and resources to perform the described effort, nor will any other supplier or source satisfy MDA requirements.  This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling agency requirements.  The anticipated period of performance is for six (6) years after contract award.  The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact RMS directly.  See note 22.

<DESC><br />The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to solicit proposals to establish an Indefinite-delivery, Indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) Task Order (TO) contract to support clinical activities for a newly evolving Pediatric Trials Network (PTN). The successful offeror shall provide the requisite personnel, facilities and services to establish, conduct, and support pediatric clinical trials and related services including: expert consultation; pediatric clinical pharmacology; product formulation; drug distribution; and device development. Data collected from the PTN will help inform pediatric labeling, and be used to develop publications and other materials that will provide pediatricians and researchers with new information on medication disposition and response in children.
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0d0d0d;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">The main objective of this project is to create an environment by which a Contractor can operate an effective infrastructure for conducting safe and effective pediatric clinical trials and for performing ancillary activities in support of these trials. Although the prime focus of this Contract is to support BPCA clinical activities, NICHD also anticipates the need to utilize this Contract to acquire similar types of support for other NICHD pediatric drug development activities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">BPCA 2007 authorizes NICHD to identify therapeutic gaps in pediatrics, which are pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics (including drugs, devices and biologics) can be beneficial to the pediatric population. There is currently inadequate infrastructure to perform this pediatric clinical trials research, and inadequate numbers of clinicians trained to perform this research. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">NICHD anticipates the need to initiate activities in approximately five (5) to ten (10) therapeutic areas, with multiple therapeutic approaches for each therapeutic area. The work will be performed under individual task orders. It is therefore likely that these activities will require multiple scientific and clinical investigators with expertise in various disease areas.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the present time, NICHD is anticipating, but will not be limited to, initiating studies in the following therapeutic areas:</span></p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for X-Ray Survey Equipment for evaluation and potential fielding to Navy end users in order to assure the Navy that x-ray machines are in compliance with Navy and Federal regulations. The Navy Radiological Systems Performance Evaluation Manual (NRSPEM) establishes for diagnostic radiological systems periodicity of surveys, parameters to be measured, training and qualification of surveyors and reporting requirements. The NRSPEM states parameters such as radiation exposure reproducibility, timer reproducibility, linearity of mA/mAs, kilovoltage accuracy and beam quality.  X-ray quality assurance (QA) requires that the output of diagnostic x-ray units is monitored to ensure that the x-ray system remains within calibration limits and patient dose is controlled. The Navy is looking to supply and supplement various commands with x-ray survey equipment capability. A minimum of fourteen (14) x-ray survey equipment will be acquired with the option of acquiring eleven (11) additional systems.
This procurement has been designated as a set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is 334517. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with  FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and award a firm fixed price purchase order. The system is expected to be a commercial off-the-shelf item which has been modified to meet the requirements in the RFQ. The RFQ will be issued and posted on FedBizOpps on or about 14 April 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA),Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Faces and Voices of Recovery, 1010 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 708, Washington, DC 20005.

The purpose of this contract will help SAMHSA/CSAT gather information pertaining to negative attitudes and misconceptions such as stigma and discrimination towards those in addiction treatment and recovery.  The information will be collected at open forum dialogues from various publics: experts in the field of substance abuse treatment and co-occurring disorders; treatment services providers; the business sector; the criminal justice sector; and from those in the social service arena among others.  Once collected, this information will be presented in a white paper format which will be used by SAMHSA/CSAT to seek for future funding to develop educational materials based on the same data.  

The proposed materials will explain the science of addiction as a treatable and manageable disease while educating about the negative attitudes and misconceptions associated with addiction treatment and recovery.  The developed resources will also aim to increase the understanding about the causes and remedies related to substance abuse disorders in order to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with this disease. This purchase order will also take into account any recommendations made by CSAT's Resiliency, Self Directed Recovery and Social Inclusion Workgroup whose mission is to influence public policy and practices that support resiliency and social inclusion of individuals and families seeking treatment services or who are in recovery from addiction and co-occurring disorders.

This contract addresses both programs and principles within the SAMHSA Matrix including substance abuse treatment capacity, co-occurring disorders, seclusion and restraint.  The activity collaborates with public and private partners in the crosscutting Matrix domains by broadening public education and the perception that negative attitudes and misconceptions about addiction and/or co-occurring disorders treatment are barriers that can and must be overcome in order to fully achieve recovery.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks:

The awarded contractor will host four (4) two-hour community based open forum dialogues on negative attitudes and misconception issues pursuant to each community which involves both mental health and recovery addiction treatment.  

Task 1: 
Submit contract plan within 30 days of award of contract.  The contract plan will list four (4) proposed cities/communities across diverse geographic and ethnic/cultural populations.  It will also provide potential dates as well as possible venues for each public forum dialogue.  The final four (4) sites and dates selections will be approved by the SAMHSA/CSAT project officer.  

The contract plan must also identify potential experts in the field of substance abuse treatment and co-occurring disorders; treatment services providers; individuals in the business sector; in the criminal justice sector; and in the social service arena among others for each of the four proposed cities/communities.  The plan will also identify how people in recovery will be part of the project in terms of planning and also being part of the discussion. Once the contract is awarded, vendor must meet with the project officer and other SAMHSA officials to brainstorm on ways to get the desired participation. 

Task 2: 
After approval, the contractor will secure venues for each forum.  Selected facilities must comply with all safety and security requirements imposed by local authorities.  Each location must be big enough to hold desired number of participants or more; desired number of participants is no less than 50.   It is recommended that the contractor approaches public buildings such as churches and/or universities where the cost for utilizing the space will be minimal.  

Contractor will be responsible for all logistical fees and monetary commitments needed to cover cost of each public forum dialogue and other incidental costs such as permits, licenses, insurance and/or any other local requirements needed. The contractor agrees that they will be solely liable for any and all legal action which may result from the conduct of this program, and they and all participants waive any rights they might otherwise have to hold the federal government responsible for any liabilities related to the conduct of this event.

Task 3:
Contractor will contact and engage the above mentioned potential publics to secure the attendance of no less than 50 participants through various means to include direct telephone calls, official invitation letters and mass media advertising/coverage. A list of no less than 50 confirmed participants will be submitted to the project officer.

Task 4: 
Contractor will contact and engage local newspapers, radio, and local cable (PEG) channels in order to advertise and extend and invitation to each media entity to cover each public forum dialogue.  HHS/SAMHSA/CSAT must be identified as the main sponsor for each forum in all invitations and advertising materials.  All materials must be reviewed and approved by the project officer before printed or aired.  In addition, a list of local media entities advertising and/or covering the forum dialogues will be submitted along with all materials produced. 

Task 5:
Develop tentative agendas for each of the four (4) public forum dialogues.  Each agenda must demonstrate how attendees will be engaged to freely participate and express their thoughts on the subject matter during the two-hour program.  It should also include a list of support materials used at each meeting, if any, i.e. videos, case studies, recorded testimonials, etc.  Agendas will be submitted to the project officer for review and approval.  A general agenda for all four events might be submitted.  However, since the public forum dialogues will take place in four different regions of the country, it is recommended that the contractor tailors each agenda to any related issues specific to each community.  

Task 6: 
This task pertains to the execution of each of the four (4) public forum dialogues. Contractor will travel to and host each forum.  The contractor will be fully responsible for capturing the information generated at each meeting; tape recorders and/or video cameras might be used for this purpose.  All participants must give their prior consent that the information they will provide will be used by the federal government to develop initiatives that address the subject matter.  A quantitative report for each forum along with any observations and/or suggestions on how to improve future forums will be submitted to the project officer.  The report must contain the final number of attendees.  

Task 7:
Contractor will compile all information gathered from each forum and draft an authoritative report, or "white paper." This document must address, but is not limited to: (a) a literature review, (b) issues encountered, (c) major findings, (d) trends as well as (e) observations and recommendations for reducing misconceptions and negative attitudes towards those in recovery.  Observations and recommendation should be highlighted using the most appropriate categories, i.e. division of environments, age groups, genders, etc. The drafted white paper will be submitted to the project officer for final editing and approval.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management, on behalf of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to CCH Incorporated, 2700 Lake Cook Road, Riverwoods, IL, 60015-3867.  

The services being acquired are software renewal and maintenance for the period of March 1, 2010 through February 28, 2011 for 738 Teammate electronic workpaper licenses to include technical support, software patches and upgrades. The OIG uses the software as its primary tool for preparing audit workpapers by its 738 auditors. 

The software renewal and maintenance are critical and without the support, the software would be difficult to use, as answers to technical issues could not be obtained.  Continuing with the maintenance agreement with CCH Incorporated is in the best interest of the Government given the company’s familiarity with the product. 

Additionally, OIG has expended numerous resources to procure and train audit staff members on its use during the eight years that the software has been used.

The CCH TeamMate Suite ("CCH TeamMate") is a Windows-based electronic audit management system.  The CCH TeamMate Suite consists of the following modules:  TeamRisk, TeamSchedule, TeamMateEWP, TeamMateTEC, and TeamCentral.
 
This acquisition is being conducted on a sole-source basis because CCH Incorporated is the owner and has full right and title to license the software package CCH TeamMate.  In the United States, CCH Incorporated is the sole entity permitted to license CCH TeamMate.
This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 5 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb, Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or vial email at awebb@psc.gov.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a need for an experienced/senior-level marine mammal observation (MMO) team to conduct marine mammal observations on behalf of USGS aboard the USCGC Healy and Canadian Coast Guard ship Louis S. St-Laurent during a U.S.-Canada offshore Arctic cruise, August 2 to September 9, 2010. For solicitation documents and information contact Jennifer Glenn at jglenn@usgs.gov.On August 2, 2010 USGS is embarking on an international expedition in cooperation with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to collect data on the continental shelf that extends beyond the 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zones of both nations (hereinafter the Extended Continental Shelf or ECS).  In standard operations, Healy will be the lead vessel with the Canadian Louis S. St. Laurent (Louis) following.  The Louis will be collecting airgun seismic-reflection profile data; the Healy will be break ice for the Canadian vessel following astern and will collect multi-beam, gravity and sub-bottom profile data, water samples, and ice.
Sounds produced during seismic-reflection surveys have the potential to disrupt the behavior of marine mammals that inhabit and/or migrate through the area.  To minimize potential effects of the seismic acoustics on marine mammals, USGS requires the services of an MMO team to serve onboard the Healy as a supplemental lookout for the MMOs who will be onboard the Louis.
In addition to other technical qualification requirements to be available in the solicitaiton, all proposed MMO team members MUST be able to pass a security background check by the Canadian Government.
A fixed price type purchase order is contemplated for this requirement. Competitive procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, will be utilized. This competition is a small business set-aside under NAICS 541690 with a size standard of $5M. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is the best value to the government. The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the low offeror. It is anticipated that a Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued and be available upon request on or about April 5, 2010 with proposals due on or about April 14,2010. All RFQ requests shall be made via e-mail to jglenn@usgs.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered. This notice and any resulting RFQ and/or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-32, effective April 20, 2009.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.The Department of Veterans Affairs, West Palm Beach intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source task/delivery order for Architect/Engineer Services with EMTEC Corporation for the design of installation of fan coil unit cooling systems in 30 telephone/data closets.  The proposed task/delivery order will be issued against the current open-ended Architect/Engineer Contract with EMTEC, V548P-1209.  The existing contract was previously competed.EMTEC will design a project to install units in the 30 most critical telephone/data closets in the medical center.  Currently the telephone/data closets are cooled using the air handler units feeding the Medical Center.  Engineering implemented Time of Day Programs for the air handlers for areas that are used only Monday-Friday.  Air handlers shut off in areas where there are no occupants.  Since the telephone/data closets now contain processer/computers controlling telephone and data, the time of day programs cannot be used due to overheating of the computer equipment.  Installing fan coil units in these closets will allow for time of day programming on the main air handlers and these smaller fan coils will allow 24/7 cooling in these closets.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  All information received by 12 noon EST, 8 March 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  NAICS code is 541310, with a size standard of $4.5M. No solicitation documents are available.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Interested parties may e-mail information to debra.becht2@va.gov .

<CONTACT>Gena B. Black, Contracting Officer, Phone 8017773115, Email gena.black@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for the purpose of conducting market research to determine if any contractors, including General Dynamics Government Systems Corporation, have the skill and knowledge to complete this effort. The Government intends to establish a new contract for engineering services and technical support for the Hardness Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Program (HSEP) on intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch and control facilities. Work shall be accomplished in accordance with the Performance-Based Work Statement. Period of Performance: 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2015, contract with a basic plus four 1-year options.<br />Electronic procedure will be used for any solicitation that may be issued.<br />The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to General Dynamics Government Systems Corporation, Needham Heights, MA. The Air Force anticipates this requirement can only be accomplished by one responsible source. General Dynamics Government Systems Corporations has the specialized capabilities necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency. <br />Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requested services, should submit a concise and program specific response, presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements; (2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and (3) appropriate Hardness Surveillance Electromagnetic Pulse Program experience to be able to conduct these services required without technical, schedule, or cost risk to the ICBM and/or similar ICBM programs prior to contract award. All capabilities that are required are further described below.<br />Operation security (OPSEC) will be required for this contract. All field testing team personnel will need to be able to qualify for a TOP SECRET clearance and be in the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). All program personnel that handle hardness data obtained during testing will require at least a SECRET clearance with a TOP SECRET recommended.<br />Engineering and technical services will include site deposture, a thorough site inspection, testing for high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) effects in accordance with MIL-STD-2169B via pulse current injection, testing for source region electromagnetic pulse (SREMP) effects in accordance with WSS-133-128C via pulse current injection, site reposture, and engineering analysis of results of the test.<br />Deposture and reposture procedures are covered under Technical Order 21M-LGM30G-2-34.<br />Site inspection would include noting parts of the system out of configuration for hardness, communications, and electrical setup. This would also entail fixing those items out of configuration before testing the site for EMP. A determination of impact will need to accompany any configuration anomalies. All primary protection devices will be tested and results will be input to a database for aging and surveillance purposes.<br />HEMP pulse testing will require construction of a pulser that meets the requirements for capability in accordance with MIL-STD-2169B. Testing will cover systems that are considered launch critical. <br />SREMP pulse testing will occur with a Government provided high energy pulser (HEP). Testing will cover systems that are considered launch critical.<br />At the end of testing, an engineering analysis of each site's hardness will be completed. This information will be classified SECRET per the ICBM classification guide. A further analysis will be conducted with statistical extrapolation for the entire Minuteman III fleet. This will be at the TOP SECRET level per the ICBM classification guide. All information will be provided to the Government as a contract deliverable.<br />General Dynamics has been performing this type of testing since 2001. Average experience for the current HSEP team with the Minuteman III system is over 20 years. This includes field personnel and engineering support. All have current security clearances and all but two are on PRP status. All but one member of the field team was either a Minuteman III maintainer or operator. Several support engineers working for HSEP also advise the ICBM Prime Integration Contractor on system design for future procurements. Of note, their experience is not limited to testing. They work and understand all security procedures required to get personnel onto a site, system specific safety considerations, and interaction with the host Wing. <br />Using their experience, General Dynamics produced a HEMP pulser tailored for the Minuteman III system. It is not owned by the Government and an incoming contractor will need to be able to produce one and get it nuclear certified by the Air Force Safety Center. Production costs were $130k over a six month period. It took another three months and a demonstration for nuclear certification.<br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely based within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

Regardless of the method, DRMS envisions multiple, multiyear firm fixed price contracts each with guaranteed minimums.

•	Arranging for interim storage of the waste, as necessary
•	Coordinating for permits and necessary export documentation (if necessary)
•	Transporting the waste from U.S. military installations to interim storage and/or final disposal facilities
•	Disposing of the waste at qualified Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) 

Forms of waste include but are not limited to:

•	A variety of used and unused batteries (including lithium)
•	Solvents
•	Decontaminate agents and kits
•	Solid waste containing heavy metals
•	Mercury and mercury containing items
•	Pesticides/herbicides/fungicides/insecticides
•	Waste oil and fuel
•	Grease
•	PoL contaminated solids 
•	Filters
•	Aerosol cans and other compressed gas cylinders
•	Asbestos items
•	Fire extinguishing residue
•	Uncontrolled medicine
•	Ethylene Glycol
•	Spill residue
•	Empty containers that previously held hazardous contents

The purpose of this request for information is twofold:  1) to identify the feasibility of such a contract, given the potential concerns and difficulties expected to be encountered by contractors when performing such a project in this area of operations; and 2) to identify the capability and interest of any firms wishing to be involved in such a project should a solicitation be pursued in the future.  

Responses are requested in electronic format, either in Microsoft Word or Abode Acrobat format.  All information submitted will be reviewed; however, DRMS may not respond to any submissions.  Information must be submitted not later than 16:30 local time on 7 April 2010, and e-mailed to the attention of Jon Machacek, Contracting Officer, at jon.machacek@dla.mil.

PROJECT DETAILS:  The Beartooth Highway in Wyoming begins at the Wyoming/Montana State Line east of Cooke City, Montana, following US 212 for 56.1 kilometers to the Wyoming/Montana State Line southwest of Red Lodge, Montana.  The project is located entirely within the Shoshone National Forest.  The project begins at approximately Mile Post 26 immediately west of Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and ends at approximately Mile Post 27.7 immediately west of Little Bear Creek.  The project is located in remote, environmentally sensitive high alpine terrain (in excess of 9,000 feet) with a very limited construction season (4 to 5 months per year), and must be completed in 2011.  Considerable attention to detail is required in project construction due the historical eligibility of the existing roadway and bridges.    

The base Schedule A for this project consists of the removal of the existing Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and reconstructing a new structure, with approaches totaling 0.4 mile, immediately adjacent to, and partially over, the existing bridge.  The existing bridge can be partially used for maintenance of traffic, and is required to be deconstructed in an extremely careful manner in order to preserve the existing stone masonry for reuse on the new structure, and limit turbidity in Beartooth Creek.  Schedule A will also contain the construction of a historic bridge interpretive site, parking area, and access trail, as well as reconstruction of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach road intersection.  The principal work items on the base schedule include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 3,500 m3 roadway excavation, 7,700 m3 unclassified borrow, 6,000 t aggregate base, 1,350 t superpave pavement, 124 m precast, prestressed concrete girders, 46,750 kg reinforcing steel - epoxy coated, 260 m3 structural concrete, 830 m micropiles, 2 trial micropiles, 131 m of Guardrail system G3 - Wyoming box beam steel posts, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

There are two optional schedules: (1) Option V – pre-grubbing removal of stumps, seeding and mulching, and erosion control, along a 1.2 mile extension of the eastern bridge approach; (2) Option W – grade, drain, and pave 1.2 miles of roadway predominately along the existing alignment east of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach intersection.  

Principal work items on Option V include: 200 hours each of Dump Truck, Bulldozer, Excavator, and Labor for stump removal, 4.0 ha seeding, 4.0 ha mulching, 2,400 m silt fence, and associated traffic control equipment/flagging, seeding, and mulching.

Principal work items on Option W include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 27,500 m3 roadway excavation, 5,100 m3 unclassified borrow, 14,000 t aggregate base, 3,650 t superpave pavement, 1,450 m asphalt curb, 450 m of guardrail system G4 (w-beam steel posts), 5.4 ha seeding, 4.6 ha mulching, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

Tentative advertisement date is late April 22, 2010 with construction being completed in one season.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in early March with construction beginning in June, 2010 and extending up to two construction seasons.

Estimated cost for the base schedule and both options is $6.0 to $15.0 million.

<DESC>The Department of Navy (DoN) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) at some future time for renewable energy generation opportunities at US Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, both located in North Carolina.
DoN will provide Government land for renewable energy generation system, or systems, to be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a private entity. 
In order for the DoN to develop a succinct RFP, we seek to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding the renewable opportunities and risks associated with these specific installations, and sites identified on the installations. The results of this RFI will assist in developing a RFP to be issued at a later date.
Specifically, the DoN objectives are: 
-Maximize the land opportunity for the development of a renewable generation asset on the specific installation.-Provide energy security for the installation. -Reduce the amount of construction waste, biomass and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) going to landfills.-Reduce the DON carbon footprint.-Maximize the financial benefits of the opportunity. -Purchase power and/or energy at a lower cost than current cost, as applicable. 
In order to meet these objectives, the DoN will consider the following opportunities: 
-On site power and/or steam production generated from renewable energy sources.-Production of "synthetic gas" to displace other fossil fuel purchases.-Production of liquid Bio-fuels and/or refuse Derived Fuel (RDF).-Wholesale generation to the utility grid, with revenue sharing considerations. -Medium to long term arrangements for the purchase of power. -Distributed generation, including net metering or feed-in tariff arrangements. -A combination of the above. 
NOTE:  DoN is considering these opportunities as viable options; however, it is interested in determining whether there are other viable renewable energy alternatives at the locations.  Firms are encouraged to submit information for other renewable energy options at the locations.  
This RFI is concerned with the following US Marine Corps bases only:
Marine Corps Base Camp LejeuneMarine Corps Air Station Cherry Point
Information is made available providing characteristics of each site at the selected installation(s) with this RFI. Attached to this RFI, are two maps of the specific locations at MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS Cherry Point.	        Attachment 1- MCB Camp Lejeune	Attachment 2- MCAS Cherry Point
More detailed information will be made available as the RFP process proceeds. Responders should identify risks and opportunities associated with each installation and each site. 
The specific information the DoN seeks at this time: 
(1) Name and brief description of company. (2) The renewable resource and technology that maximizes the opportunity at each installation and site.(3) The size and capacity of the project that maximizes the opportunities at each site, and describe what type of arrangement maximizes that opportunity, i.e. wholesale generation, power purchase agreement, distributed generation or a combination. If a combination, describe size and capacity of each. Provide discussion on how each opportunity was considered with respect to the following: 
  (a) Risks and opportunities of transmission access and    capacity for each installation.   (b) Incentives (state, utility, etc.).  (c) Other costs (standby charges, departing load, application fees, etc.).  (d) Utility Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) process and Market Price Referent (MPR), or other utility processes and market benchmarks, as applicable   (e) Sales or purchases of Renewable Energy Credits(REC's) or Portfolio Credits (PC's) as applicable.  Include the effects of Renewable Energy Credit trading under the following regimes:         1. Government procurement and ownership of RECs;       2. Contractor procurement and ownership of RECs.  (f) Land opportunity, e.g. cost of lease for similar government or privately owned land.  (g) Other risks and opportunities. 
(4) Indicate which technologies present the best opportunity for development with a brief discussion why. Indicate if there are economies of scale in pursuing more than one installation, and what if any contractual arrangements would be beneficial.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for<br />Project Foreign Material Management System (FORMMS)
<p><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Defense Information Systems Agency, DITCO-Scott PL8313, P.O. 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406</p>
<p>Description:<br />PURPOSE: The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to procure Project Foreign Material Management System (FORMMS). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>TARGET AUDIENCE: In particular, only small businesses are requested to respond to this RFI to assist the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers small business ability to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors.</p>
<p>Sources Sought:<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses to the following criteria ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes 541519 or 517110.

Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.</p>
<p><br />Background:<br />The Department of Defense has a Foreign Materiel Program that is unique (acquisition, exploitation, inventory, final disposition), as is the FORMMS software that supports it. The Foreign Materiel Management System (FORMMS) Program has been an ongoing program for over ten years. The current contract has moved the program to a point where it is able to be fielded for four agencies. The FORMMS program is unique, and cannot be duplicated with other software, due to the<br />Defense Department's sensitive mission. The DoD acquires foreign military items for testing and evaluation. These are numerous and various, and often sources and uses are classified. The FORMMS program currently in use tracks these items from the beginning of the requirement through its acquisition, exploitation, to final use or destruction. The inventory locations are spread out over numerous locations, and must be accessible on mobile tracking systems (laptop or portable inventory trackers). The information required is enormous (tens of thousands of line items of a sensitive nature) and complicated. FORMMS is a system that requires constant and immediate attention. In case of personnel vacancies, an immediate, replacement expert is crucial. Due to FORMMS essential nature to the DoD's mission, any down-time can critically delay testing and information gathering that may have an adverse effect on the lives of US soldiers. The FORMMS system is used in shipping items urgently to Iraq and Afghanistan</p>
<p><br />Requested Information:<br />Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum 6 page statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following objectives for the anticipated FORMMS task order:</p>
<p>1. The contractor must demonstrate experience working on multi-agency programs within the Intelligence Community (IC) for Foreign Materiel specific systems.</p>
<p>2. The contractor must show that they can maintain and enhance classified systems without interruption or introduction of severe defects. Down time cannot exceed four hours.</p>
<p>3. The contractor must show experience with complicated IC, Army, DOD customized inventory tracking systems, such as requirements and acquisition, exploitation, inventory, loans, and final disposition.</p>
<p>4. The contactor must show experience integrating or sharing data between multiple IC, Army, and DOD systems that support customized applications using complex technology.</p>
<p>5. The contactor must show success with Army, DOD, and IC Information Assurance certification and accreditation.</p>
<p>6. The contractor must show that they can fill vacant TS/SCI with eligibility for SSBI positions in a timely manner, while fulfilling the security requirements of DD Form 254, ARMY SCI Addendum and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for clearance.</p>
<p>7. The contractor must demonstrate their ability to utilize and conform to standardized software development lifecycle processes in accordance with DoD best practices.</p>
<p><br />Responses<br />Responses to this RFI are to be submitted by e-mail to trudy.thalmann@disa.mil and RECEIVED by 8:00 A.M., central time, 31 March 2010. Responses must be single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font, with one inch margins, and compatible with MS Office Word 2003.</p>
<p>Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All government and contractor personal reviewing RFI responses will have signed non-disclosure agreements and understand their responsibility for proper use and protection from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described 41 USC 423. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified.</p>

The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). </span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The extended period of performance is&nbsp;1&nbsp;April 2010 through 30 September 2010 to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for Land Records Improvement in Wyoming.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
Land Status records consist mainly of Master Title (MT) and Use plats and Historical Index (HI) pages.  All actions affecting the use of public lands are recorded on the Historical Index pages with current cases graphically portrayed on the plats.  The plats and HIs are used to process renewable energy applications therefore the information portrayed should be accurate and current as well as being in a digital format, well-organized, and accessible in an effective and efficient manner.
The LR2000 database consists of 3 major databases derived from the daily workings of the lands and mineral staff.  The Status database contains case information that affects administration of public lands, i.e. patents, withdrawals.  The Case Recordation database contains information pertaining to temporary actions that affect the availability of federally administered lands for approved actions, i.e. oil and gas leasing, wind energy farms.  The Legal Land Description database provides information pertaining to the official cadastral survey of record and the derivation of corresponding legal descriptions. 
The information contained in the LR2000 databases is instrumental in providing public access to case information and, since it contains legal land descriptions and acreage associated with each case, one should be able to derive geospatial information easily and on demand.
To accomplish the requirements of this task, the vendor shall verify that all official records and other documents affecting renewable energy areas are current, complete, and in digital format.  This includes scanning of approximately two million Controlled Document Index (CDI) cards.  The vendor shall assure data contained in LR2000 accurately and precisely reflects the official record in accordance with revised LR2000 standards with land description that can be mapped in GIS.  The vendor shall prepare data to be published on either the intranet or internet.
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

Notice Type: Special Notice 
Synopsis: The Department of Defense Deputy Chief Management Office is proud to announce the 2nd Annual Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Symposium: Government and Industry Best Practices on April 21 & 22, 2010.

About this Event: On April 21 & 22, 2010 at the Sheraton Hotel in Crystal City, VA, the 2nd annual SOA Symposium will bring together lessons learned and emerging topics from both government and industry SOA experts, practitioners, and projects. The theme of this year's SOA Symposium is "Discipline, Teamwork & Semantic Technologies" to make SOA a successful reality. 

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has embarked on a path to implement SOA as a primary means to deliver increased capability to the warfighter by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations. Industry around the world has demonstrated that SOA can substantially reduce the cost of IT infrastructure while greatly improving business agility. Both the IT and the business communities must jointly own and manage a proven inclusive architecture to achieve SOA success. 

In 2009, the DoD SOA Symposium demonstrated that SOA must be considered a Team Sport, involving all elements of people, process, technology, and especially Trust; Stephen M.R. Covey led a workshop based on his bestselling book The Speed of Trust. This 2nd Annual DoD SOA Symposium is focused on the Discipline necessary within each individual team member and the team as a whole to be successful; baseball hall of famer Cal Ripken Jr. will share his personal experiences and highlight discipline and teamwork as necessities for success.

Network with more than 500 Service Oriented Architecture leaders from across the U.S. Government and Industry.  The SOA Symposium will be held on April 21 and 22, 2010, at the Sheraton Crystal City in Arlington, VA, USA.

You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the federal agency specified in this Noticet.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the specific requirements for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSNs: 7220-01-579-6875<br />Name: Peel N Stick Kit<br />Description: PEEL N STICK KIT OF (31) 2' X 2' PIECES OF 710 MATERIAL</p>
<p>NSNs: 7220-01-579-6877<br />Name: Peel N Stick Kit<br />Description: PEEL N STICK KIT OF (21) 3' X 2' PIECES OF 710 MATERIAL</p>
<p>NSNs: 7220-01-579-6876<br />Name: Peel N Stick Kit<br />Description: PEEL N STICK KIT OF (14) 3' X 3' PIECES OF 710 MATERIAL</p>
<p>NSNs: 7220-01-579-6880<br />Name: Peel N Stick Kit<br />Description: PEEL N STICK KIT OF (10) 3' X 4' PIECES OF 710 MATERIAL</p>
<p>NSNs: 7220-01-579-6870<br />Name: Peel N Stick Kit<br />Description: PEEL N STICK KIT OF (6) 4' X 5' PIECES OF 710 MATERIAL</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service, Household and Industrial Furniture (GSA), Arlington, VA. GSA will stock the items specifically for the U.S. Navy for use in the naval vessels.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Department of the Navy (currently, Navy contracting activities are buying these products - purchasing will shift to GSA) and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None reported.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Department of the Navy for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the Department of the Navy.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 2, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Proposed contract is for collection and delivery of quantitative catch and biological data on groundfish, shrimp and invertebrates caught in the 2010 large mesh and small mesh surveys and the first segment of the 2011 ADF&amp;G large mesh trawl survey in a manner consistent with survey data collected during the AFSC's Gulf of Alaska (GOA) biennial groundfish trawl surveys and Pavlof Bay surveys. The NMFS and ADF&amp;G conducted a special study in 1997 to develop the necessary comparisons to allow the data collected by the ADF&amp;G survey with NMFS survey data in the assessment of Gulf of Alaska groundfish. These ecological data are required to maintain a time series for tracking the status and trends of important groundfish species. The time series is needed for stock assessments that are used to develop harvest level recommendations for key groundfish species. These data formed the longest continuous annual survey of its type in the North Pacific. The data from this time series have also been instrumental in describing ecological change in the Gulf of Alaska following the 1976 climate regime shift in the North Pacific. This project would continue the survey support provided since 1997.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries (NMF), Fishery Resource and Monitoring Division (FRAMD) located in Seattle, WA 98115 on a sole source basis with Dr. Quinn Weninger of Iowa State University. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will provide the following services: 1) conduct a literature review regarding the generation and distribution of economic rent in fisheries managed under catch shares, (2) develop a theoretical model of rent generation and distribution based on the findings of the literature review, (3) empirically implement the theoretical model in the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery using cost earnings data for 2007 and 2008 collected by the NWFSC, and (4) provide written documentation and an in-person presentation at the NWFSC of results from the previous three steps. Dr. Weninger is unique in terms of having (1) knowledge of economic theory relevant to the generation and distribution of economic rent under catch share management programs, (2) knowledge of statistical and econometric tools relevant to empirical cost and production analysis, (3) experience working with West Coast groundfish trawl fishery participants, and (4) familiarity with West Coast groundfish trawl fishery management under the Pacific Fisheries Management Council. All four of these areas of knowledge and experience are essential to completing the tasks described in this contract. Developing and empirically implementing a model of rent generation and distribution for the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery requires a unique knowledge of the theoretical foundations of rent generation, empirical tools used to study cost and production, and West Coast groundfish trawl fishery characteristics and management. Dr. Weninger has successfully completed contracts with the NWFSC in the past, and is the only individual who offers this unique combination of skills and experience. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with a period of performance commencing approximately from date of award through Dec 31, 2011with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government's belief that only Dr. Quinn Weninger of Iowa State University can provide these services. However, other potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services may submit such data which demonstrates the technical requirements stated above no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. This data must include sufficient information to allow NOAA to evaluate the proposal relative to the technical requirements stated above.

<CONTACT>James H Mowery III, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-4959, Email james.mowery@dot.gov
<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, and under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, (a), 2, (i), in accordance with 41 U.S.C 253(c) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and the National Transportation Library (NTL) located at 1200 New Jersey Ave. S.E. Washington, DC 20590 intend to award a SOLE-SOURCE contract to RightNow Technologies (RNT), to procure an incident management system that enables responses and tracking of email, web, and phone inquiries about BTS, RITA and the broader U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and creation and maintenance of a fully searchable FAQ database.  

The aforementioned contracting activity proposes to issue a procurement request/purchase order to purchase software from RightNow Technologies (RNT) for the RITA BTS Office Transportation Information Resources (OTIR).  OTIR operates customer services in the form of contract management for telephone, web, and e-mail queries for the Department’s Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Team American Recovery and Reinvestment Act activities, the Office of the Secretary, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and the National Transportation Library (NTL) Digital Repository and other services.  RNT’s Customer Relations Management (CRM) software will be used for tracking, query management, knowledgebase development, and comprehensive reporting on a regular and ad hoc basis.  

The National Transportation Library responds to up to 2,500 queries per month from the general public, Congress, the media, other federal and state agencies, and USDOT personnel. This acquisition is for software and data hosting, product maintenance, technical support, ability for local interface customization (to match Departmental and RITA web branding), ability to expand to chat/instant messaging services, and product update services.  

RNT can host the CRM software on its own servers and provide use of the software as a service. A low-cost hosted solution will save BTS the annual maintenance fee for software covering user licenses, technical support, and software updates. Without a hosting option, technical support (including daily purging of personally identifiable information or PII appearing in email or web requests over 45 days old), product maintenance, and updates to the software, the ability of BTS to expand its services to customers, increase its knowledgebase, dramatically reduce the opportunities for intrusion, and secure its systems against vulnerabilities, will be severely compromised.

RNT is the only CRM company offering an integrated suite of software solutions, 
including web self-service, contact management, case tracking and response (via phone, 
email, and the web), enabled through a  self-learning, self-managing and self-organizing 
knowledgebase. Automatic responses, routing and escalation workflow, and metrics survey 
are all provided through the knowledgebase function, which drives real-time, intelligent 
customer interactions by accurately predicting and anticipating customer questions. The 
knowledgebase should respond instantly to seasonal spikes, enabling the software to 
automatically scale service capabilities to meet service demand. Without the ability to provide an integrated, self-service, customizable databases of FAQs,  and scalability to accommodate enormous spikes in email, phone, and web requests with auto-responses, NTL operations will be completely impaired.   

The General Services Administration (GSA) uses the same software for the management of its USA.gov website and is creating a government-wide knowledgebase leveraging the knowledge bases at other agencies. It is believed that RNT’s CRM software is the only product being used to develop this collaborative tool, which enables seamless, automatic integration of  FAQs for the Department and transportation-related inquiries into USA.gov’s website and centralized FAQ’s for the entire Federal Government, resulting in more efficient operations at GSA and eliminating operational redundancies at DOT and GSA.  Use of RNT’s CRM can also ensure that the NTL is in compliance with the response-time standards set by USA Services’s Citizen Service Levels Interagency Committee (CSLIC) Report.  

This procurement is for software implementation and maintenance.  The effort to select potential sources was conducted by RITA/BTS staff.  USDOT will determine that the proposed cost is realistic, fair, and reasonable.  The proposed contractor is the only available source for these services.

USDOT has no other option for purchasing software for the BTS National Transportation Library Reference Team.  RightNow Technologies, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and sole provider of maintenance for their CRM software. The Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions.  

Again, RITA believes that RightNow Technologies is uniquely qualified to carry out the specialized nature of the required work at the high level of quality indispensable to DOT. Notwithstanding the overwhelming SOLE-SOURCE qualifications thought to be possessed by RightNow Technologies, any organization OTHER THAN RIGHTNOW TECHNOLOGIES that believes it is capable of providing a hosted CRM system for incident tracking, query management, searchable knowledgebase development, automatic integration of FAQs with USA.gov, enable a locally customizable interface, automatically strip PII from content and headers of incidents, and provide comprehensive reporting capabilities that are provided by RIGHTNOW TECHNOLOGIES may e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to James Mowery, at james.mowery@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time April 12, 2010.

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).</p>
<p>( ) TIN: --------------------.</p>
<p>( ) TIN has been applied for.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>

<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.</p>
<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p>The Contractor represents that it ( ) is, ( ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 332117- assigned to contract number 500.</p>

Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either--</p>
<p>(1) Cancel the stop-work order; or</p>
<p>(2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if--</p>
<p>(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal at any time before final payment under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.</p>
<p>(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.</p>
<p>(e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.</p>

<p>***************************************************************************************** <br />IMPORTANT DELIVERY INFORMATION<br />*****************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Tinker Air Force Base has constructed a "Truck Entry Gate" (Gate 33), which is located at the corner of 59th Street and Air Depot Blvd (southwest corner of the base). The gate will be opened beginning 15 September 2004.</p>
<p>Gate 33 shall be used for all deliveries by truck to this base. <br />(Trucks will not be allowed to gain access through any other gate.)</p>
<p>Since your firm's delivery on this order is affected, please advise your delivery carrier to use the new gate. This should minimize the impact of your delivery.</p>
<p>DELIVERIES TO BUILDING 3001 (B / 3001)</p>
<p>Be advised that delivery vehicles destined for B / 3001 are prohibited from using "Staff Drive".</p>
<p>Delivery vehicles may make deliveries only in designated unloading areas.</p>
<p>Since your firm's delivery may be affected, ensure that your delivery carrier receives proper instructions on<br />delivery / unloading requirements for B / 3001. Unloading in designated unloading areas will minimize any inconvenience, and, attendant ramifications, which may accrue, to your delivery / delivery carrier for failure to adhere to this requirement.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>

<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. <BR><BR>Marginal - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. <BR><BR>Unacceptable - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. <BR><BR>In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the down-selected proposals. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Each down-selected proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR> FAR 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998). <BR><BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government. The competing offerors' price is more important after technical information is acceptable. The government seeks to award to the offeror who best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quoted shall be made. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of clarifications, will be considered for award. A rating of unacceptable will render the entire proposal unacceptable. The Government will determine technical acceptability as described by the evaluation factors. In making this decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation team's evaluations of the evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>1. Technical Factor: Trained Contractor Personnel: The standard is met when adequate resumes/certifications for key personnel are provided with sufficient information indicating personnel education, experience, references, and examples of work submitted as well as any other information relative to performance of this contract. The extent, depth and quality of the key personnel's relevant work experience, as well as the quality and applicability of their education technical experience and professional development as they relate to their proposed position in performance of the contract shall be evaluated.</p>

<p>Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Acceptable - meets minimum mandatory requirements.<br />Unacceptable Unacceptable - does not meet minimum mandatory requirements.</p>
<p>2. Price Factor: This factor will evaluated the cost proposal to determine price analysis and price reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of the work. This may be ground for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. By signing its offer, the offeror certifies that the price stated on the CLIN includes an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit. Review of the offeror price data will consist of an analysis to determine the following:</p>
<p>(A) Price Analysis. All cost and financial information required by the is RFQ and amendment (s) there to have been submitted. One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis.<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.<br />(2) Comparison if prior proposed prices and contract prices with current proposed prices received for the same or similar end items.<br />(3) Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Estimates (IGE).<br /><br />(B) Price Reasonableness. Each quotation will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be reasonable. The government will evaluate price reasonableness in relation to commercial or market price lists, IGE, or any other information used as a basis for comparison.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NB842010-A-04116 is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541712. The NIST has a requirement for Critical Compilations of Energy Levels and Wavelengths for the Neutral and Single-Ionized Chromium Atoms. BACKGROUND The NIST Data Center on Atomic Spectroscopy is responsible for carrying out critical compilations of the spectral lines and energy levels of atoms and atomic ions that are important for a number of national programs, such as for example:</p>
<p>Development of new sources of energy, such as magnetic fusion with tokamak machines.</p>
<p>Understanding spectra observed from ground based telescopes and from space-based telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray observatory.</p>
<p>Development of improved lighting sources.</p>
<p>The work is generally performed by thoroughly searching the published scientific literature and web databases to acquire all relevant materials for an atom selected to be of interest. Wavelengths and energy levels extracted from the relevant materials are compiled into tables in text format. As part of this process, the data are checked for reliability. A number of methods are used for these checks:</p>
<p>1. Comparison of results from different sources for mutual consistency.</p>
<p>2. Comparisons with properties calculated theoretically from first principles with quantum mechanical computer programs..</p>
<p>3. Please see other REFERENCES/PUBLICATIONS at the end of the PWS for more information.</p>
<p>Where necessary, theoretical calculations may be made to fully characterize literature data in terms of quantum properties of the energy levels of the atom that is being characterized.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>This acquisition is for Contractor services to carry out critical compilations of energy levels and wavelengths for the neutral and singly-ionized chromium atom, Cr I and Cr II. Critical compilation of energy levels and wavelengths is a research-based evaluation of accuracies and involves an understanding of the relative accuracies of the various experimental and theoretical methods used to generate the data, including internal consistency of the data with each other in the framework of known trends, limits, and interactions in the quantum mechanical theory of atomic structure. The completed compilations shall be assembled in a form suitable for publication. Contractor shall also carefully review publisher's page proofs for the compilation of wavelengths and energy levels of Ar II through Ar XVIIII (307 pages).</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TASKS<br />The Contractor shall furnish the necessary labor to carry out the procedures as described above to perform critical compilations of wavelengths and energy levels and update the main database data according to the following tasks:<br />Task 1: Wavelengths and energy levels of the neutral chromium spectrum - Cr I.<br />a. Collect wavelengths and energy levels from all available papers in the literature on experimental results for Cr I.<br />b. Provide critical evaluations of accuracies of Cr I energy levels and wavelengths.<br />Task 2: Wavelengths and energy levels of singly-ionized chromium spectrum - Cr II<br />a. Collect wavelengths and energy levels from all available papers in the literature on experimental results for Cr II.<br />b. Provide critical evaluations of accuracies of Cr II energy levels and wavelengths.<br />Task 3: Review the proofs of the accepted manuscript of wavelengths and energy levels of Ar II through Ar XVIII. (307 pages of singly spaced text and tables.)<br />Review the proofs of the critical compilations for Ar II through Ar XVIII so that the published journal article is correct. (The last publication required seven sets of proofs before the journal got it right.)</p>

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before April 1, 2010.


BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below.  In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter’s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.  

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.    

Factor 1 – Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements.  Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter’s ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, lodging, and secured storage.  Quotations must address the quoter’s ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking.  Quotations should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained.  (b) Availability of Dates.  Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested.  Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference.  (c) Location.  Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located within or within close proximity to one of the following cities: Palm Springs, CA; Palm Desert, CA; Desert Hot Springs, CA; Cathedral City, CA; Rancho Mirage, CA; and Indian Wells, CA with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters.  Site Visits:  The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.  

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years.  The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client’s program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided.  EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and décor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc).  In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating. 

Factor 3 – Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate.  Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.  

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the quoter’s initial quote should contain the quoter’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52  Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services—Certification, apply to this acquisition.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Therefore, offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms. The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.<br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Past Performance, Technical Capability, Proposal Risk Assessment, and Price.<br />1) Technical Capability, which consists of the following equally weighted factors:<br />(a). Suitability of the proposed platform to paint CGC WAESCHE from the water. This includes the length, width and draft of the proposed platform, and method of anchoring and/or mooring the platform in a position to allow safe painting operations in open water and exposed weather conditions normally expected during the month of May at Coast Guard Island in the Oakland, CA Estuary. It also includes the offerors understanding of requirements to introduce a platform inside the physical security barrier that protects ships moored at the pier at Coast Guard Island (called a "whisper wave"). This includes use of a suitable commercial vendor to open and close the barrier for initial access, any additional access the contractor requires, and ultimate removal.

Suitability of the methods proposed to conduct all operations in a manner that will prevent a "discharge" (to the standard of No Reportable Release per 40 CFR) of paint or any other prohibited materials into the waterway.<br />2) Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items, specifically painting of vessels 210 feet or longer from the water, either currently being performed or completed in within three years prior to the date of this synopsis/solicitation.

This risk assessment will evaluate the degree to which the proposed method of performance has potential impact upon: (1) Safety of contractor personnel while working from a floating platform to a height of approximately 45' above the ship's waterline. (2) Potential for damage to CGC WAESCHE from the size and plan of mooring and/or securing the proposed barge/float to accomplish the required painting. (3) The demonstrated capability of the barge/floating platform to provide space and operating equipment that will be needed to conduct the low pressure wash down and all required painting. (4) The potential for discharge of prohibited substances into the environment, and (5) Risk to schedule, price, performance and/or the level of Government monitoring that may be necessary during contractor performance. This risk assessment will aid the Source Selection official in making the best value determination.<br />4) Price: The aggregate price determined by totaling the offer price for the definite items, plus the composite labor hour extended total.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>INSPECTION OF CUTTER PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF OFFERS<br />(a) All prospective offerors are urged to visit the cutter and visually inspect each item of<br />Work and to become acquainted with local conditions, locations of items and fixtures,<br />removals, replacements, interference and the nature of work. The CGC WAESCHE will<br />be available for ship check during the solicitation process. Please call LT Anthel &lsquo;Evan' Barnes, Project Manager of the CGC WAESCHE, at (510) 637-5964 to arrange a ship check.<br />(b) Failure to inspect the cutter will not relieve the offeror from responsibility for properly estimating the difficulty or cost of successfully performing the work.<br />(c) The Government assumes no responsibility for any representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers, agents, or employees before execution of the contract unless included in the solicitation, documents incorporated therein or amendments thereto.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH<br />(a) An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.<br />(b) The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.<br />(c) Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.<br />(d) The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.<br />(e) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.<br />Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals should be written AND NOT EXCEED TEN (10) PAGES and submitted in a legible format. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The proposed content will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in SOW (see Attachment B: SOW and other terms and conditions) and demonstrate the ability to meet the salient characteristics and compatibility requirements (Attachment C: Compatibility Requirements). The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement. 2) Past Performance: Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed with other federal agencies during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offer or has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services. This is a matter of judgment. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's past performance record. Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given. A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance. Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance. A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. 3) Key Personnel. Proposed key personnel must demonstrate their expertise, experience, knowledge in administrative, migration of repositories, conversion of SoDA reports to BIRT, trouble shootings, technical expertise and training of Requisite Pro and its components. 4) Price. The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options. Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor&rsquo;s online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award. ELECTRONIC AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY Section 508 Standards and Instruction Full conformance or levels of conformance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. &sect; 794 (d) was enacted in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities. The Act required the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) to create federal standards for electronic and information technology (EIT) products (goods and services) to make them more accessible by individuals with disabilities. The technical standards applicable to this requirement are: The following applications standards have been identified as being applicable for this service: &sect; 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. &sect; 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications. &sect; 1194.31 Functional performance criteria. &sect; 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support The Contractor must ensure that all EIT products and services proposed that are less than fully compliant, are offered pursuant to extensive market research, which ensures that they are the most compliant products available to satisfy the contract&rsquo;s requirements. If any such EIT product or service proposed is not fully compliant with all of the standards, the Contractor shall specify each specific standard that is not met; provide a detailed description as to how the EIT product or service does not comply with the identified standard(s); and shall also indicate the degree of compliance. The Contractor shall identify via a submission of a voluntary product accessibility template (VPAT) all EIT products and services proposed, identify the technical standards applicable to all products and services proposed and state the degree of compliance with the applicable standards. Additionally, the Contractor must clearly indicate where the information pertaining to Section 508 compliance can be found (e.g., Vendor&rsquo;s or other exact web page location). The Contractor must ensure that the list is easily accessible by typical users beginning at time of award. (xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. (xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (DEC 2009), applies to this acquisition (See clauses in attachment #1) (xvi &amp; xvii) All questions must be submitted in writing to Jody.O&rsquo;Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Wednesday, March 16, 2010.

<DESC>In response to questions received, the following information is provided to all potential offerors:
1) Does the Navy want a "Y" axis on this machine for purposes of machining the flat on the two parts detailed in the UL Spec Dwg. requirements?    
#1 answer) NO
2) Your UL_spec_requirements do not list live tools in the Turret.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support</strong> (OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Integration Systems &amp; Solutions) to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). </span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The extended period of performance is&nbsp;1&nbsp;April 2010 through 30&nbsp;June 2010&nbsp;to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to DTFAWA-10-R-00013 is to notify all vendors that section L.17.3.2 Appendix has been deleted and to identify North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code information.
The following information identifies the NAICS codes in the announcement:Te suggested North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for the effort are tentatively 238210, 541710, 335110, and 335122.  If other NAICS codes are believed to be appropriate, companies should include an explanation in the response.  
There will be three additional attachements with this amendment, Amendment #00001 cover page, a Revised Section L (32310), and a question/answer page.
This is a 100% set-aside for Small Business. Teaming and subcontracting opportunities are encouraged.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking interested vendors to develop a feasibility study.  Based on the results of this study; the vendor will design, manufacture, and test MALSR Light Emitting Diode (LED)/Infrared (IR) prototype lamps.

This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFOMRATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract to Verizon Business for continuing technical support to the International Satellite Communications System (ISCS) 2nd Generation (G2) Extended (e) network program. This support network includes dissemination of critical, time-sensitive, meteorological aviation products and meteorological, hydrological, and climatologic products to domestic and international users located in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean Regions. 
The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to award a non-competitive contract to Verizon Business, the existing ISCS satellite provider.  The FAA has determined that it is critical to continue work on an uninterrupted basis with Verizon Business until such time as the ISCS requirements are completed. To successfully finish these tasks, continuity of support is required. This award will allow the FAA to maintain continuity and consistency in transitioning from satellite broadcast to an internet file server.
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly. Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Vito Pietanza, Contracting Specialist by 10:00 A.M., Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, March 31, 2010. 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with submissions related to this announcement will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 01- HEREBY ISSUED TO CORRECT PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THIS PROJECT. <br /><br /><br />This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) located in Seattle, WA 97115 on a sole source basis with Alaska Dept. of Fish &amp; Game (ADF&amp;G). The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will conduct groundfish data collection on-board Alaska Dept of Fish &amp; Game's large and small mesh survey and a small mesh survey of Pavlof Bay. Proposed contract is for collection and delivery of quantitative catch and biological data on groundfish, shrimp and invertebrates caught in the 2010 large mesh and small mesh surveys and the first segment of the 2011 ADF&amp;G large mesh trawl survey in a manner consistent with survey data collected during the AFSC's Gulf of Alaska (GOA) biennial groundfish trawl surveys and Pavlof Bay surveys. The NMFS and ADF&amp;G conducted a special study in 1997 to develop the necessary comparisons to allow the data collected by the ADF&amp;G survey with NMFS survey data in the assessment of Gulf of Alaska groundfish. These ecological data are required to maintain a time series for tracking the status and trends of important groundfish species. The time series is needed for stock assessments that are used to develop harvest level recommendations for key groundfish species. These data formed the longest continuous annual survey of its type in the North Pacific. The data from this time series have also been instrumental in describing ecological change in the Gulf of Alaska following the 1976 climate regime shift in the North Pacific. This project would continue the survey support provided since 1997. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately July 01, 2010 through June 30, 2011with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government's belief that only ADF&amp;G can provide these services. However, other potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services may submit such data which demonstrates the technical requirements stated above no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. This data must include sufficient information to allow NOAA to evaluate the proposal relative to the technical requirements stated above. Responses shall be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition estimated value not to exceed $100,000.00. ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>UPDATE: EVENT REGISTRATION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO 03/26/2010<br /></em></strong><br />Introduction</span><br />The Magnet Systems Team of the US ITER Project Office is responsible for delivering the Central Solenoid (CS) Magnet System to ITER, an international collaboration head-quartered in Cadarache, France. The project is being designed and built by the ITER partners: the European Union, India, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States. US project responsibilities will be accomplished through a collaboration of DOE laboratories, universities, and industry. The U.S. ITER Project Office is hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with partner labs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory. <br />From Latin for "the way", ITER has the goal of demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of extracting net power from a burning, fusion plasma. Achieving this burning plasma requires the resolution of complex physics issues and the integration of new and improved technologies. ITER is designed to be the premier scientific tool for exploring and testing expectations for plasma behavior in the burning-plasma regime, wherein the fusion process itself provides the dominant heat source to sustain the plasma temperature. The fusion power from this machine will be up to ten times greater than the total external power required for operating the machine and heating its plasma. As such, it will provide the scientific basis and plasma-control tools needed to move toward commercial power from fusion energy.<br /><br />The United States is an equal, non-host partner, responsible for about 9% of the construction cost of ITER. As such, it will contribute hardware components, personnel, cash, and contingency during the construction phase of the project. The CS magnet system will be a major part of the US-contributed hardware.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span>The CS Magnet System is very large superconducting magnet system that will be comprised of a stack of 6 Modules and the External Structure that holds them all together and supports them during operation. A total of 7 CS modules will be manufactured, with one serving as a spare. All modules will be delivered to the ITER Site, Cadarache, France, along with the External Structure and special tooling for assembly.<br /><br />The CS Modules will be constructed from Nb3Sn-based, cable-in-conduit conductors supplied by the Japanese Team in lengths of either 600 or 900 meters each (and weights of about 11 or 16 metric tons, respectively). Each module will weigh approximately 110 metric tons when finished, and when assembled, the total system will be approximately 18 meters tall and weigh around 900 metric tons. When charged to full current of 45 kilo-amperes, the assembly will produce fields of over 12 Tesla and will store over 6 Giga-Joules of energy. Terminal-to-terminal operating voltages up to 14 kilo-volts are expected. The superconducting-magnet technologies embodied in the ITER CS Magnet System are essential to future fusion reactors but may also be regarded as enabling technologies for future large superconducting magnetic systems.<br /><br />The design of the CS Magnet System is presently in an advanced conceptual-design stage. The project is now ready to begin preliminary design.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition Plan<br /></span>An acquisition plan has been developed. The main elements of the acquisition plan are as follows:<br />&bull; The US Domestic Agency (DA) is responsible for the design of the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling and for the assembly procedures<br />&bull; Industrial vendors will be selected after final design to provide the CS structures and assembly tooling <br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS structures and assembly tooling to assist the US DA design and planning efforts<br />&bull; Long lead materials for the CS structures will be procured by the US DA before the completion of final design and provided to the industrial vendors as government furnished equipment (GFE)<br />&bull; An industrial vendor will be selected as soon as possible to provide the CS module fabrication<br />&bull; The US DA will develop (with industry support) critical fabrication processes prior to award of the CS module fabrication contract and transfer this technology to the industrial vendor<br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS modules as needed to assist the US DA design, manufacturing development, and planning efforts until the production contract is awarded<br />Schedules for acquiring the CS modules, structures, and assembly are illustrated in the attached figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Look Forward at ITER CS Business Opportunities</span><br />The purpose of this announcement is to identify prospective vendors to support this acquisition plan through assisting in CS design and planning activities, providing structural materials, and fabricating the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling.<br /><br />To provide early information about the ITER CS design, fabrication, and future business opportunities, <strong>a vendor conference will be held on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 7, 2010</span></strong> in Oak Ridge, TN. At this conference, the CS acquisition plan, along with details of the project schedule and the design and fabrication effort will be presented and discussed. Potential suppliers for CS modules, structures, assembly tooling, and bulk materials are encouraged to attend. Feedback from prospective vendors on the acquisition plan is sought.<br /><br /><strong>Registration for the vendor conference is required before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 26, 2010</span>. Please register with Pat Smith, US ITER Contracts Assistant, by COB, March 26, 2010. (Pat Smith, 1055 Commerce Park, MS 6483, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6483, smithpr1@ornl.gov, 865 574-2883).</strong> Registration by e-mail is preferred. Company name, number and names of potential attendees, and country of citizenship are required. Attendees that are not United States citizens must also provide their date of birth and country of birth. If you are unable to attend but are interested in future CS business opportunities, please contact Pat Smith.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS modules will begin with the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) in August 2010 and contract award in March 2011. This will be a contract for a single vendor (or team) for the fabrication of the CS modules.<br />Preliminary design will be in progress during the period of this solicitation. Manufacturing input into CS module design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS modules are encouraged to participate in these study contracts, or BOAs, for providing manufacturing input. <br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in May 2013 and contract award in October 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS structures.<br />The design of the CS structures may entail the use of hundreds of tons of high strength stainless steel. To avoid lengthy schedule delays, we plan to procure much of this material in advance and provide it to the structure fabricators as government furnished equipment (GFE). The RFP for this procurement will be released midway through final design in February 2012 with contract award in June 2012.<br /><br />The US DA is responsible for providing any special purpose assembly tooling needed to assemble the CS modules and structures into a single unit. Procurement of the CS assembly tooling will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in January 2013 and contract award in June 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS assembly tooling.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures and assembly tooling will not occur until after final design is completed. As with the CS modules, manufacturing input into CS structures and assembly tooling design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS structures and assembly tooling are encouraged to participate in these study contracts or BOAs for providing manufacturing input.<br /><br />We thank you for your interest in the potential ITER CS business opportunities.</p>

<DESC><BR>CONTRACT AWARD IS CONTINGENT UPON APPROVAL OF BIOLOGICAL OPINION<BR><BR>At this time, USACE  Portland does not have an approved Biological Opinion in place with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for dredging at the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR).  Until the Biological Opinion is approved, no dredging can occur at the MCR.  It is anticipated approval of the Biological Opinion will occur in early April 2010. <BR><BR><BR>This synopsis has been amended to include Southwest Washington Littoral Drift Restoration and North Jetty Berm Disposal (Pump-ashore).  <BR><BR>Description:  The purpose of this project is returning sand to the littoral drift of SW Washington which will provide sand to shorelines within the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) littoral cell using material from maintenance dredging from the Columbia River at the Mouth, OR and WA project.  The following pumpashore work scope will be included in the 2010 medium-sized hopper dredging contract conducted for channel maintenance at MCR (North Coast Hopper 2010): Mobilization/demobilization for pumpout and upland disposal operations. <BR>The first portion of this work will be similar to the work in 2008 (North Jetty Berm Repair) which augmented the foredune in order to protect the North Jetty. Estimated quantity 20,000 cy. <BR>The second portion of this work will be similar to the work in 2002 which pumped material into the inter-tidal zone in order to supply sand to the littoral drift system. The material will be placed further north between 1500 and 4500 ft north of the North Jetty.  Estimated quantity 300,000 cy. <BR>In-water work period for pumpashore operations: July 15-September 15.<BR><BR>The description for a Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) has been removed from this synopsis.

<DESC>This RFP has been amended to include&nbsp;clarification from the Grantee on the following technical questions as well as the two attachments&nbsp;below.
<p><br />1. With respect to Task 2, has the architectural design work been completed to a sufficient level to be considered one of these three and if so which level of completion, Schematic Design, Design Development, or Construction Documents? If not will architectural drawings be completed prior to commencement of the geothermal feasibility study?</p>
<p>The architectural design and master plan have been completed. Please visit the following site for more detail about the Kober Affordable Housing Project:</p>
<p>http://www.uci.ps/kober/index.php</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that some changes may be made to the architectural designs in the future. This brings me to an important point about the feasibility study: the objective is essentially to build a sort of model that will easily accommodate different heating/cooling loads and changes in the input parameters. For example, if the apartment cooling load decreases from 20 kW to 15 kW due to design changes, it should not be difficult to determine the total required bore field, system cost, and effects on the system output. Although the study will focus on the Kober Affordable Housing Project, the idea is to create study/model that can be applied to different housing projects in the future.</p>
<p>2. What is the maximum depth to which the Grantee's drilling rig can drill?</p>
<p>The maximum depth to which we will allow our Enteco E4 drilling rig to drill is 120 meters (specs are attached). We prefer to keep our boreholes at a maximum 100 meter depth. Although our rig has drilled to deeper depths in the past, drilling below 100-120 meters puts significant pressure on our rig and risks losing an entire drill stem.</p>
<p>The West Bank's geology is mainly composed of limestone rock with pockets of sandstone. In the past, although this occurs infrequently, we have abandoned boreholes due to the difficulty of penetrating through earth. This usually occurs due to fractures in the rock formation at random depths. We do expect that a drilling expert will be supervising the drilling of the thermal conductivity test holes.</p>
<p>3. What is the standard or typical borehole diameter on the drill bits of the Grantee's rig?</p>
<p>Our drill bits are 127 millimeters in diameter, which drill a 5" borehole.</p>
<p>4. Related, what is the maximum tremmie pipe length that can be used to grout a maximum depth borehole (i.e. you can only grout up to 300' but can drill a 400' borehole)?</p>
<p>We use a GeoLoop grout pump and mixer (manufactured in the US, specs attached). We currently use an 1 &frac14;" diameter tremmie pipe that is 120 meters in length.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, James A. Haley VA Hospital, Tampa, FL2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of operating space and nursing support services for JAHVAH staff physicians to perform minor ambulatory surgeries from University of South Florida Board of Trustees for its College of Medicine.3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Contractor provides anesthesia operating space and nursing support service for JAHVAH staff physicians to perform minor ambulatory surgeries.  The JAHVAH has a need for offsite ambulatory space in which to perform minor ambulatory surgeries due to insufficient onsite operating room space.  The mission of the Veterans Administration is to provide medical treatment to Veterans that have served this nation.  To accomplish this mission it is necessary to contract for additional resources which are beyond the capacity of the JAHVAH to provide at this time.  Services required are for the period 2/22/10 through 8/21/10.4.	Statutory Authority:  	Unusual and Compelling Urgency, FAR 6.302-25.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: Unusual and compelling urgent precludes the use for full and open competition which will interrupt and delay Veteran patient healthcare treatment.  Further delay of continued contract performance would result in additional cost to the VA to procure healthcare treatment by Fee Basis and by other outside sources. 6.	Actions to Promote Competition:In accordance with VA Directive 1663 a long term contract for a base and 4 option years is in the review and solicitation process.  Additional time is required to accomplish the review, solicitation, source selection, award decision, award review and approval and subsequent contract award.  Local sources were contacted for prices and capability to provide service within the time period required.  Considerable start up time is required therefore no offers received for short term requirement.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(2) Exceptions FedBizOpps notice was not published.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $490,000 per six months.  In accordance with VA Directive 1663 the price is stated at the Medicare rate minus a discounted percentage based on CPT code.  Contractor provided a percentage discounted from Medicare rates.8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  (copy for acquisition plan)9.	Other Considerations:  Providing services through Fee Basis would result in an additional cost of one to two percent.  The public opinion which would result from temporary termination of contractors' healthcare services would be extremely detrimental to the Veterans Administration.10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:In accordance with VA Directive 1663 a long term contract for a base and 4 option years is in the review and solicitation process.  12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  _____________________________	________________________Lillian G. Dawes, M.D.	DateChief of Surgical ServiceJames A. Haley Veterans' Hospital13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 a.	Contracting Officer's Certification: (required)  I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief._____________________________                       2-19-2010Charlene K. Stiens	DateContracting OfficerVHA Service Area Office EastAcquisition Service Area Office 8 (ASAO 8)?MARKET RESEARCH REPORTForOffsite Ambulatory Surgery CenterSourcing:	Internet search engine Google, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) & VETBIZ.  Reference attached listings compiled from the internet, CCR, previous Market Research report, and Self-identified sources via email.General:	A recurring need exists for a contractor owned and operated offsite surgery facility to be utilized by VA physicians to perform minor ambulatory procedures within a close proximity of the James A. Haley VA Hospital (preferably within 5mi).  The necessity for the surgery center to be located close to the VA Hospital is due to patient care issues, such as the need to admit patients to the hospital should complications occur, and to minimize travel time for the Physicians coming and going to the Surgery Center.  The selected free standing ambulatory surgery would provide operating space and nursing support.  Note: anesthesia services are being contracted for separately and will not become a part of this requirement.  However, this market research did inquire as to the relationship each facility has concerning anesthesia services.	The surgical centers contacted were asked if they contract with outside facilities/physicians to provide surgical facilities, and the extent of the services provided (Anesthesia Services, ancillary health care personnel, equipment and supplies).  Research has found that some centers have in house employees (normally the larger hospitals) while others sub-contract for the service which is billed separately.  Note: any sub-contracted service would require the sub to agree to the terms and conditions of the Government contract.  Surgery centers are licensed through the State of Florida by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), whereas Ambulatory sites provided by hospitals are licensed through the Hospital's license.  Hospitals are usually accredited through JCAHO, the Joint Commission.  The following documents the results of this Market research.1.	University of South Florida4202 E. FowlerTampa, FL 33620-9951974-4594POC: Mr. Richard Green	University of South Florida is the incumbent contractor providing offsite ambulatory surgery center for James Haley VA Hospital.  They have performed satisfactorily through the life of their contract and the customer is fully satisfied with the quality and level of service.  The capabilities of USF have not diminished over time and they desire to be considered eligible to compete for the follow-on contract.  The subject contract relationship allows the VA to introduce a separately awarded contractor for anesthesia services in direct support of the medical procedures performed during Offsite Ambulatory Surgery.  The proximity of USF's facility to James Haley Hospital is a definite strength, being located across the street from the Hospital.  USF is CCR registered with an active status until 07/28/2010.2.	Tampa Outpatient Surgical Facility5013 N. Armenia Ave.Tampa, FL 33603875-0562x204POC: Christina McDonald	Tampa Outpatient Surgical Facility is in the business of providing surgical facilities to hospitals and physicians and is licensed by the State of Florida.  They bill per procedure and currently contract with one anesthesiologist.  Note: Tampa Outpatient Surgical Facility is the only entity I found to be registered as Small Business.  The others are unknown, unverifiable, or other than small business.  Tampa Outpatient Surgical Facility is interested in being solicited if this effort develops into an actual requirement.3.	Ambulatory Surgical Center4500 E. Fletcher Ave.Tampa, Fl 33613977-8550POC: Beverly Martin	Ambulatory Surgical Center also provides surgical facilities to hospitals and physicians and is licensed by the State of Florida.  They bill per procedure and currently contract with Northwood Anesthesia for services.  Note: I could not find Ambulatory Surgical Center registered in CCR so I could not confirm their business size standard.  Ambulatory Surgical Center is interested in being solicited if this effort develops into an actual requirement.4.	St Josephs Same Day Surgery Center3003 W. MLK Jr BlvdTampa, Fl 33607870-2108POC:  Michele Cimino	St Josephs Same Day Surgery Center is owned by St Josephs Hospital (one of the largest Hospitals in the area) and is accredited through the Joint Commission.  They bill per procedure, to include the services of their resident anesthesiologist, they do not sub-contract this service.  St Josephs Same Day Surgery Center is interested in being solicited if this effort develops into an actual requirement.  5.	Tampa Bay Surgery Center11811 N. Dale Mabry HwyTampa, Fl 33618961-8500POC: Dr Rosen	I contacted Tampa Bay Surgery Center and spoke to Shannon she stated they are licensed by the State of Florida as an Ambulatory Surgical Center and are interested in the solicitation if produced.  However, I was referred to Dr Rosen as the point of contact for specific information concerning the company.  They have two facilities with the addition of their MLK Blvd center. 6.	Tampa Bay Center for Specialized Surgery2808 W. Dr. MLK Jr BlvdTampa, Fl 33607874-2040POC: Mary Dykema	Tampa Bay Center for Specialized Surgery identified their company via email.  I could not find any reference to this firm in CCR or VETBIZ, however, when I asked the receptionist, she said they were a small business and run the operation with one Physician.  Their facility is a State certified Ambulatory Surgical Facility.  7.	Bay Area Physicians Surgery Center6043 Winthrop Commerce Ave.Riverview, FL 33578699-1200x1235POC: Patti HolstonBay Area Physicians Surgery Center identified their company via email as well.  However, their email provided a more detailed description of their capabilities and facilities than "Tampa Bay Center for Specialized Surgery".  They are a Multispecialty, physician owned, freestanding surgery clinic licensed by the State of Florida.  Their last ACHA survey returned no deficiencies.  Again, I could not find any reference to this firm in CCR or VETBIZ.  They are interested and have requested to be notified if a solicitation is produced.  (ref: attached email for facility specifics).8.	Florida Medical Clinic14547 BBD Blvd #ATampa, Fl 979-0440POC: CathyLeft message; no response CCR VetBiz Search:	Search of CCR using NAICS 621493 "Freestanding Ambulatory Surgical and Emergency Centers" in Tampa Florida returned four (4) possible matches (profiles attached).  After close review of the four, only one (Tampa Outpatient Surgical Facility) was determined to be in the industry and considered a possible source.  The other three were primarily Mobile immunization service providers, Medical staffing specialists, and Emergency counseling provider.	Search of VetBiz was accomplished in an effort to locate possible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms interested in this requirement.  Unfortunately, the search returned no records.  (Ref; Attached copy of VetBiz Search)Summary:	Market research in support of the subject requirement failed to locate sufficient numbers of firms that; possess the capability to meet the requirements of the proposed action; and which also meet any targeted socioeconomic category.  One CCR certified small business has been identified, and a possible second.  However, due to the magnitude and technical nature of this requirement and the results of this market research, I have no reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more small business concerns that exhibit both capability and performance record to meet this requirement.  Therefore, based upon this determination, the solicitation for "Offsite Ambulatory Surgery Center" will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition procedures.  Added emphasis should be given to evaluation factors that address proximity to James Haley Veterans Hospital (preferably within 5mi radius).CHARLENE K. STIENSContracting Officer

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8. James A. Haley VA Hospital, Tampa, FL2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of anesthesia service supporting JAHVAH staff physicians performing minor ambulatory surgeries at VA contracted site from Unicom Anesthesia Associated, Incorporated, 3100 E. Fletcher Ave, Tampa, FL.3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Contractor provides anesthesia support service supporting JAHVAH staff physicians performing minor ambulatory surgeries a VA contracted site.  The JAHVAH has a need for offsite ambulatory space in which to perform minor ambulatory surgeries due to insufficient onsite operating room space.  The mission of the Veterans Administration is to provide medical treatment to Veterans that have served this nation.  To accomplish this mission it is necessary to contract for additional resources which are beyond the capacity of the JAHVAH to provide at this time.  Services required are for the period 2/22/10 through 8/21/10.4.	Statutory Authority:  	Unusual and Compelling Urgency, FAR 6.302-25.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: Unusual and compelling urgent precludes the use for full and open competition which will interrupt and delay Veteran patient healthcare treatment.  Further delay of continued contract performance would result in additional cost to the VA to procure healthcare treatment by Fee Basis and by other outside sources. 6.	Actions to Promote Competition:In accordance with VA Directive 1663 a long term contract for a base and 4 option years is in the review and solicitation process.  Additional time is required to accomplish the review, solicitation, source selection, award decision, award review and approval and subsequent contract award.  Local sources were contacted for prices and capability to provide service within the time period required.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(2) Exceptions FedBizOpps notice was not published.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $75,000 per six months.  In accordance with VA Directive 1663 the price is stated at the Medicare rate minus a discounted percentage based on CPT code.  Contractor provided a percentage discounted from Medicare rates.8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  (copy for acquisition plan)9.	Other Considerations:  :  Providing services through Fee Basis would result in an additional cost of one to two percent.  The public opinion which would result from temporary termination of contractors' healthcare services would be extremely detrimental to the Veterans Administration.10.	 (data, estimated cost, or other rationale at to the extend and nature of the harm to the Government)11.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None12.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:In accordance with VA Directive 1663 a long term contract for a base and 4 option years is in the review and solicitation process.  13.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  _____________________________	2/18/2010Lillian G.

Stiens	DateContracting OfficerVHA Service Area Office EastAcquisition Service Area Office 8 (ASAO 8)?MARKET RESEARCH REPORTForOffsite Anesthesiology ServicesSourcing:	Internet search engine Google, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) & VETBIZ.  Reference attached listings compiled from the internet, CCR.General:	A recurring need exists for a contractor to provide Anesthesiology Services.  This service is in support of the VA's Offsite Ambulatory Surgery program at a contractor owned and operated offsite surgery facility.  This facility is utilized by VA physicians to perform minor ambulatory procedures within a close proximity of the James A. Haley VA Hospital (preferably within 5mi).  The necessity for the surgery center to be located close to the VA Hospital is due to patient care issues, such as the need to admit patients to the hospital should complications occur, and to minimize travel time for the Physicians coming and going to the Surgery Center.  Anesthesia services will be contracted for separately, and will not become a part of the Offsite Surgery Center contract.  However, this market research did inquire as to the capability of providing the requested services at the surgery center contracted by the VA.	The s Anesthesiology contractors contacted were asked if they contract with outside facilities/physicians to provide Anesthesiologist Services, as well as the extent of the services provided (Anesthesia Services, ancillary health care personnel, equipment and supplies).  Research has found that some centers have in house employees (normally the larger hospitals) while others sub-contract for the service which is billed separately.  Note: any sub-contracted service would require the sub to agree to the terms and conditions of the Prime contract.  Anesthesiologist are licensed through the State of Florida, however, they must be Board certified by the "American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA).  The following documents the results of this Market research.1.	Unicom Anesthesia Associates LLC 3100 E. Fletcher AveTampa, FL 336213615-7294POC: Mr. Jeff beard	Unicom is the incumbent contractor providing anesthesiology services offsite ambulatory surgery center for James Haley VA Hospital.  They have performed satisfactorily through the life of their contract and the customer is fully satisfied with the quality and level of service.  The capabilities of Unicom have not diminished over time and they desire to be considered eligible to compete for the follow-on contract.  Unicom's contract relationship allows the VA to introduce a separately awarded contractor for anesthesia services in direct support of the medical procedures performed during Offsite Ambulatory Surgery.  Unicom is CCR registered with an active status until 07/10/2010.  They were not registered as Small Business or any other socio-economic category, nor were they found in Vet Biz.2.	Northwood Anesthesia Associates LLC1501 S. Pinellas Ave.Tarpon Springs, FL 34689727-937-6020POC: Sheila	Northwood is in the business of providing anesthesiology services to offsite surgical facilities and physicians, and is licensed by the State of Florida.  They are currently providing the exact services for Ambulatory Surgical Center of Tampa, FL (ASC).  I contacted ASC Ms Beverly Martin, and she confirmed that Northwood provides the subject services, and has performed satisfactorily.  Northwood is not CCR registered and could not be found in the VetBiz database either.  Northwood Anesthesia Associates LLC is interested in being solicited if this effort develops into an actual requirement.3.	Vernon Sondak12902 Magnolia DR.Tampa, FL 33612945-9211POC: VernonLeft message; no response CCR VetBiz Search:	Search of CCR using NAICS 621111 "Offices of Physicians (except Mental Health Specialists)" in Tampa Florida returned two (2) possible matches (profiles attached).  After close review of the two, both could be considered to be an industry provider, however, Unicom Anesthesia Associates was the only active registrant good until 07/10/2010.	Search of VetBiz was accomplished in an effort to locate possible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms interested in this requirement.  Unfortunately, the search returned no records.  (Ref; Attached copy of VetBiz Search)Summary:	Market research in support of the subject requirement failed to locate sufficient numbers of firms that; possess the capability to meet the requirements of the proposed action; and which also meet any targeted socioeconomic category.  One CCR certified small business has been identified, and a possible second.  However, due to the magnitude and technical nature of this requirement and the results of this market research, I have no reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more small business concerns that exhibit both capability and performance record to meet this requirement.  Therefore, based upon this determination, the solicitation for "Offsite Anesthesiology Services" will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition procedures.CHARLENE K.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification Review DocumentForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of construction services for Project 568-10-101, Update Nurse Call/Code Blue Systems.  This work consists of replacing and upgrading existing nurse call systems in various clinical areas.  This project is the final project in a series of nurse call upgrades.  At completion of this project, all nurse call systems at the Fort Meade VA Medical Center will be of the same type and manufacturer, which will allow for facility wide integration of alarms, codes, call information, etc.3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of engineering, furnishing, installing, programming and testing of  new call system equipment.  Work also includes removal of existing devices and cables.  Value per vendor proposal is $140,651.4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The proposed vendor, Beacon Communications, LLC,  has performed on all prior nurse call upgrades at this facility within the past 5 years.  The first 2 projects, completed in FY 2005 and FY 2007, were accomplished as negotiated SBA 8(a) set aside contracts, with Beacon Communications providing the new equipment, programming, and installation in a sub-contractor role.  Both the 2005 and 2007 installations utilized the Responder 4000 system equipment, manufactured by Rauland-Borg Corporation.  Beacon Communications is the exclusive Rauland-Borg distributor for this area.  During negotiations for the first installation in 2005, proposals for several different systems were evaluated, and the Rauland-Borg system was chosen based on competitive price, high reliability, and exceptional warranty.  The systems installed to date have been nearly trouble free, and the BMET staff is very happy with them.  In FY 2008, a third nurse call upgrade was accomplished, utilizing Beacon, Communications as the prime vendor to engineer, furnish, and install all new equipment.  The project was completed with no problems.  It is in the best interest of the Government to continue services with this vendor.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Statutory Authority 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) is being cited.6. Sources Solicited:  There is no question that the work on this final nurse call upgrade must continue to utilize the Rauland-Borg Responder 4000 equipment, as system compatibility throughout the medical center is the most important issue being addressed.  In order to provide system wide code blue capability, for example, the systems must be of the same architecture.  Beacon Communications is the authorized Rauland-Borg supplier for this area.  They are also a veteran owned small business.  It would be possible to compete this project with multiple contractors, but they would all likely be using the same supplier/installer (Beacon) anyway.  Therefore, no further market research was conducted, and a sole source justification will be posted in Federal Business Opportunities.7.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  In accordance with FAR Part 7, and buyers knowledge, a minimal Market Survey was accomplished.  As the only authorized Rauland-Borg distributor in this area, Beacon Communications is considered the only available firm to engineer, supply, install, program, and test the entire system using Rauland-Borg equipment. 8. Market Research Conducted: The Rauland-Borg components required for the system upgrades are available on GSA schedule.  The VA could purchase the individual components directly from Rauland-Borg, and furnish them to an installer.  However, only the system vendor (Beacon) has the expertise to determine which components are required for a complete and functional system, and they would need to be retained to design and install the system anyway.  It is our intention to verify prior to award that Beacon is using pricing for the system components in line with the GSA schedule pricing.  9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The nurse call systems are a vital component in the patient care environment.  The centralized code blue systems being added on this project are essential to emergency response in critical situations.  It is very important to utilize a competent vendor that is thoroughly familiar with the Rauland-Borg systems to avoid potential problems.  Since Beacon has installed all prior systems, it makes good sense to continue to use them to complete the station wide upgrade. 10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition:  Due to limited available of funding in each fiscal year it was necessary to break the nurse call replacement effort into numerous phases, ward by ward.  If funding had been available to award the complete project at one time, it would have been possible to award to a single vendor instead of requiring sole source awards to maintain project integrity.11.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the justification provided herein, recommend acquisition of this membership using other than full and open competition under authority of FAR 6.302-1.12.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  The Contracting Officer's determination that $140,651  is a fair and reasonable price and is based on published price lists and pricing for the same service to the private sector.________________________________________Contracting Officer		dateconcur________________________________________Warranted One Level Above CO		dateNOTE:  Additional approvals may be required at a level as high as the Agency Senior Procurement Executive (for procurements exceeding $50,000,000. The citation for these levels of approval is VAAR 806.304.
