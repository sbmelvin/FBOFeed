<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01144 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13) exceptions: (i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. A request for quote solicitation will be made through Federal Business Opportunities website and offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to negotiate on a five year (1 year base and 4 options) contract on a sole source basis (IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)). The proposed source is Research Triangle Institute, 3040 W Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-0155. The requirement is for Civilian Testing Inspection Services, for the Army Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory (AFTDTL) at Fort Meade, MD, in order to remain compliant with all current Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP) technical and regulatory requirements, and maintain certification requirements under the DHHS NLCP.
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), by the authority of Section 503 of Public Law 100-71, 5 U.S.C. Section 7301, and Executive Order No. 12564 established the scientific and technical guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs and established standards for certification of laboratories engaged in urine drug testing for federal agencies. As required, HHS originally published the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (Guidelines) in the Federal Register (FR) on April 11, 1988 [53FR 11979]. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) subsequently revised the Guidelines on June 9, 1994 [59 FR 29908], September 30, 1997 [62 FR 51118], November 13, 1998 [63 FR 68483], April 13, 2004 [69 FR 19644], and November 25, 2008 [73 FR 71858] with an effective date of May 1, 2010 (correct effective date published on December 10, 2008 [73 FR 75122]). The effective date of the Guidelines was further changed to October 1, 2010 on April 30, 2010 [75 FR 22809]. When the guidelines were first published in the Federal Register in 1998, HHS awarded a contract, known as the National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP), to develop a laboratory certification program that satisfied the requirements specified in the Guidelines. The contract was awarded to the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) of North Carolina, thus making RTI the mandatory source for laboratory certification. Given no other vendor can provide NLCP Civilian Testing Inspection Services, Research Triangle Institute is the only vendor capable of meeting the requirements of the Government. RTI will perform maintenance inspections and performance testing maintenance for the drug lab located at Fort Meade. The proposed contract will have a period of performance of 01 October 2018 - 31 September 2019.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement; however, if a vendor challenges the basis of this requirement, please submit a capability statement that includes sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to submit a product meeting the minimum requirements specified above. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source procurement.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 2:00 PM Local Time, Thursday 13 September 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: usn.detrick.navmedlogcomftdmd.mbx.doddrugtestingprogramnmlc@mail.mil. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E148, Rockville, MD 20850, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institute of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) plans to procure Spatial Statistical Analysis and Methodology, on a sole source basis, from StatNet Consulting, LLC, at 22403 Goshen School Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20882.</p>
<p><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. This acquisition is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 511210 and the business size standard is 38.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. The period of performance shall be 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is (1) to provide expertise in spatial and spatial-temporal anomaly detection methods for the extensions to the NCI's annual surveillance data analysis, (2) to extend and generalize the existing spatial-temporal model of cancer incidence and mortality, and (3) to provide expertise in the development of enhanced geo-visualization tools.</p>
<p>The Surveillance Research Program (SRP) has developed a series of statistical methods for the analysis of spatial patterns in cancer data. These include a spatial scan statistic (SaTScan), a spatial outlier detection tool (MGPS), a median-based spatial smoother (Headbang), and a spatial-temporal model of cancer incidence. SRP has also developed statistical methods to detect non-spatial patterns in cancer surveillance data like Joinpoint, a linear spline tool to detect changes in temporal trends. Statistical and geographical visualization tools including Micromaps; ESTAT, the Exploratory Spatial-Temporal Analysis Tool; and CIrank are among the tools that are frequently utilized in detecting cancer patterns and trends. Finally, SRP has successfully led efforts in predicting US and state-level cancer counts using spatial and spatio-temporal projection methods for both mortality and incidence. SRP currently uses these tools in many ways for cancer surveillance and reporting activities. With the recent release of SEER cancer incidence data, the need has arisen to develop statistical and visualization approaches to identify high and low clusters of cancer incidence, as well as to provide software tools to perform such analyses.</p>
<p>Tasks</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Provide recommendations on statistical and graphical approaches to identify high or low cancer clusters as for the new SEER cancer data</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide recommendations on statistical and graphical approaches to identify high or low clusters of cancer incidence rates for the new SEER cancer data which was released in April 2018. The data are accessible through SEER*STAT software from the SEER server http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/. These analyses involve application of existing tools and development of new statistical methods as needed in order to more accurately identify:</p>
<p>1)geographic regions with high or low clusters and 2) periods during which the high or low clusters exist. The Contractor shall attend periodic meetings with SRP scientific staff regarding this task, and provide results of analyses as a word document to the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Government shall provide the Contractor the access to the relevant datasets.</p>
<p>Task 2: Provide software to perform the analyses in Task 1 and ensure that it has the versatility to conduct future analysis</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide software to perform the analyses in Task 1. The software not only applies to the specific SEER datasets described in Task 1, but s should have the versatility to enable it conduct future data analysis with use similar approaches. Government shall provide the Contractor the specifications of the software.</p>
<p>Task 3: Provide recommendations on selection of geographic units when comparing cancer incidence or mortality rates</p>
<p>Cancer incidence or mortality rates can be compared between countries, states, counties, or geographic units smaller than counties, but smaller population sizes in these units usually make the rates very unstable so the comparisons of them are meaningless. The Contractor shall perform statistical analyses that take into account the uncertainty in the rate estimates and statistical powers, and then make recommendations on selection of geographic units to use for cancer rate comparison.</p>
<p>Task 4: Provide recommendations and guidance as subject matter expert for spatial and geographical statistical analyses</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide recommendations and guidance in the application of the spatial-temporal model of cancer rates and trends. The Contractor shall provide subject matter expertise in the expansion of GIS collaborations at NCI, NIH, and other agencies. Recommendations shall be provided on a weekly basis by telephone and monthly by teleconferences. In addition, monthly reports on these recommendations shall be provided as word documents.</p>
<p>Place of Performance</p>
<p>Service shall be performed at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>REPORT(S)/DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>All written deliverable products shall be submitted in draft format for review, comment and approval by the COR. Final copies of approved drafts shall be delivered to the COR within five (5) business days after receipt of the Government's comments. Electronic copies of reports shall be submitted in Microsoft Office 2007 OR Word format or more recent version, unless prior approval for another format has been obtained from the COR. Software should be in R packages or other statistical languages approved by COR.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction:<br /></strong>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) supports a global research portfolio to advance biological knowledge of HIV/AIDS, its related co-infections, and co-morbidities. With the ultimate goal of creating an "AIDS-Free Generation," the division develops and supports the infrastructure and biomedical research needed to: 1) halt the spread of HIV through the development of an effective vaccine and biomedical prevention strategies that are safe and desirable; 2) develop novel approaches for the treatment and cure of HIV infection; 3) treat and/or prevent HIV co-infections and co-morbidities of greatest significance; and 4) partner with scientific and community stakeholders to efficiently implement effective interventions.
<p>NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of individuals who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing.</p>
<p>NIAID aims to achieve comparability between U.S. (licensed labs) and non-U.S. generated study results. The purpose of this contract for Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) is to enhance the ability of current and future mostly non-U.S. laboratories participating in NIAID-supported clinical trials to perform tests in accordance with good clinical laboratory practice standards and produce reliable test results. SMILE will continue to serve current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups), as well as individual grantees conducting clinical research.</p>
