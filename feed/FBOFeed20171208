<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $38.5 Million average annual receipts.<br /><br />AFRL requires Cadence software license bundles for Integrated Circuit (IC) Layout software consisting of the following: Innovus Implementation System.<br /><br />The government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Cadence Design Systems, 2655 Seely Ave Bldg 5, San Jose CA 95134.<br /><br />The Government has determined that no other source has commercial offerings that can meet this requirement. The program office has developed a complex series of commands, applications, and customized tools to control the Cadence IC layout software based on the unique command structure of the product. At this time the engineers only have developed a command set to control the Cadence set of IC place and route tools and their flow supports only Cadence software for layout of IC design, making it the only suitable product for the current IC layout effort. The design flow and tools are interdependent; using another software product would require significant engineering man hours and cost to redevelop the series of commands, applications, and customized tools. This represents a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Brooke.McDonald@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 01 January 2018.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.<br />

<p>The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to manufacture this item. Firms interested in participating in this procurement are encouraged to contact the OEM, Hamilton-Sundstrand CAGE 73030 to inquire about the data or rights to the data.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE - Paragon Analysis, Corp.
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has a requirement for Advanced Cash Flow training and intends to solicit, on a sole source basis, to Paragon Analysis, Corp. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) - only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The OCC anticipates award of a Purchase Order for multiple sessions of a five-day instructor-led Advanced Cash Flow class that is designed for the regulatory community to deepen examiners' ability to evaluate a borrower's cash flow and credit risk. One to three sessions will be offered annually.</p>
<p>The highly specialized Advanced Cash Flow training curriculum was previously developed by the subject-matter-expert Paragon Analysis and adapted to OCC's regulatory mission. The course has been vetted with the Chief National Bank Examiner's (CNBE) office and the Continuing Education program office to ensure that the curriculum is consistent with OCC's policies and practices on cash flow analyses as taught in other pre-commissioned credit courses. The process of review and approvals by the CNBE office enabled the course to be appropriately integrated into the OCC bank examiners' curriculum without conflicting with OCC policies or other training courses and without repeating other course curriculum. The anticipated period of performance is from February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for quotations, and no solicitation package will be issued. The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>NSN 4820-01-584-3397. Item Description: Sea Water Control Kit. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (1H855) P/N IEC-TEM-9537915.
<p><br />Quantity: 14. Unit of Issue: AY. Destination Information: Virginia Beach, VA. Delivery Schedule: 145 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote, which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 15 AUG 2017. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Ives Equipment Corporation (1H855).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>

<a href="mailto:robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov">Click here to email Robert Taylor II</a>
<DESC>Background:
In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey/Request for Information for the purpose of soliciting information and capabilities from interested vendors to  provide the FAA with a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for a Direct Current Back-Up System (DC BUS) power System.

The FAA may use the information resulting from this Market Survey as the basis for requests for one-on-one discussions with industry, or to plan one or more vendor industry days.

The nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make further acquisition decisions based on those responses.
 
This Market Survey conveys the potential agency need for, and seeks technical information on, DC BUS equipment functional capabilities. Responses will assist the FAA in further developing its acquisition strategy for DC BUS equipment.  All information provided in response to this Market Survey may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Information considered proprietary or confidential must be clearly marked as such.  Any information not identified as proprietary or confidential will be used at the FAAs discretion and may be publicly released without further FOIA disclosure review by the FAA or respondent(s).

PURPOSE:
The primary goal of this Market Survey is to: 
1.  Obtain current DC BUS technical information for consideration against current and future FAA National Airspace System (NAS) facility requirements. 
2.  Obtain current Alternative Energy options (wind, solar, etc.) for consideration against current and future FAA NAS facility requirements.
  
STATEMENT OF NEED:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition and life cycle in-service support of 24-volt Direct Current Back-Up System (DC BUS) power supplies.  The intent is to acquire Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) equipment. Given that NAS radio facility loads, runtimes, and available space can vary, the FAA is interested in modular systems that utilize common architecture and equipment that can be configured as small, medium, or large systems based on site-specific requirements.  All system configurations would need to provide redundancy.  System training and technical support needs should be common and should not vary from one configuration to another.  
       
A DC BUS is required to provide conditioned, uninterruptible electrical power to support electronic equipment and air-to-ground radio communication equipment.  The DC BUS shall supply fully conditioned and continuous power during normal operations, and be capable of providing continuous rated power during loss or interruption of input AC power by using power stored in the battery bank.

Perspective vendors are asked to provide the following information, including but not limited to, on the technical capability of their product(s).  
1.	AC Input Voltage 
2.	DC Output Bus Current
3.	Rectifier/Charger Redundancy
4.	DC Ripple Voltage (AC ripple riding on DC output)
5.	Automatic switching time between rectifiers and back to utility power.
6.	Operating ambient temperature
7.	AC to DC Efficiency, at rated input and output voltage, with batteries fully charged.  
8.	Output Voltage Transient Recovery.
9.	Inverter Output Power (120 volts AC)
10.	Bypass around the inverter(s) and rectifier, connected to DC BUS distribution cabinet and to the output of the inverter(s) that will automatically switch when either the inverter fails or DC bus voltage reaches discharge limit of battery string; automatic bypass switching time in milliseconds.
11.	Converter output voltages and current.
12.	Electromagnetic Interference.  System effect on Amplitude Modulation (AM) radio equipment operating in the following frequency ranges:  VHF, 115 to 130 MHz; and UHF, 320 to 370 MHz.
13.	Remote Monitoring
14.	Physical Dimensions.
15.	Distribution Panel
16.	Battery Type(s) Available (Lead-Acid, Lithium Ion, NiCad, etc)
17.	Battery Runtimes 1, 4, 24 hrs, 36 hrs, 72 hrs.
18.	Warranty
19.	DC BUS equipment that can incorporate alternative energy options.

The survey is not to be construed as a Screening Information Request (SIR), nor Request for Offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and assumes no liability for any cost associated with the submission of responses to the survey.

INFORMATION REQUESTED:
All interested sources are invited to respond to this announcement by providing their DC BUS equipment technical capabilities and equipment configuration, as detailed above.  See Attachments 1 and 2 below.

<DESC>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E132, Bethesda, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Center Research (CCR), Genomics Core Branch (GCB) plans to procure on a sole source basis for a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation, 3175 Stanley Road, Grand Island, New York 14072.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500.</p>
<p>Delivery is within 1 - 2 weeks from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The Purpose of this acquisition is to procure The BigDye&reg; Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. This kit will be used to perform Sanger Sequencing in the CCR Genomics Core on government-owned ABI 3130xL (NIH # 01939017 &amp; 01963827) and ABI 3730xL (NIH # 01939405) Genetic Analyzers.</p>
<p>The use of the BigDye&reg; Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit by the CCR Genomics Core is critical to the ongoing research and experiments. The CCR Genomics Core has over 700 registered users who are currently performing quality research with the provided reagents processing over 30,000 Sanger Sequencing samples per month. Any change to the kit currently in use will result in additional variables in all experiments and will require the acquisition of replacement equipment in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The BigDye&reg; Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit has been used in the Core and will continue to be used by NCI as well as several other NIH Institutes. The BigDye&reg; Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit manufactured by Life Technology is compatible with existing NCI ABI genetic analyzers. The kit's superior chemistry allows NCI to generate data with uniform peak heights and optimized signal balance-which results in longer, higher-quality reads. One can also get more accurate base assignments for heterozygote and mutation detection. Moreover, the BigDye&reg; Terminator v.1.1 kit's chemistry is compatible with current software and our current instrumentation does not require recalibration.</p>
<p>Even though NCI CCR already possesses the Genetic Analyzer, no other manufacturers' kit is known to work with the Applied Biosystems 3130 or 3730 Genetic Analyzers. Moreover, any change to the sequence chemistry currently in use will result in additional variables in all experiments and will require the acquisition of replacement equipment valued in the millions of dollars. The demand for the Sanger Sequencing is significant in the Core processing over 30,000 samples per month.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested parties, especially small businesses, believe they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on December 21, 2017. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Ronette Collins, Contract Specialist at ronette.collins@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification on Sam.gov, www.sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02RC82514-73 all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><p>AE2100D3 Engine Components Repair (C-130J) Survey</p>
<p>CAUTION:</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualifications and capability to repair AE2100D3 engine components, used on the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules, used by the United States Air Force (USAF) and various Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.</p>
<p>Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. The only known source is Rolls-Royce Corporation, Indianapolis, IN. No samples are available for potential vendors to evaluate.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. Below is a document containing a description of the engine components repair requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting this requirement. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />a. Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business.</p>
<p>3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>4. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to Marcus R. Green at (478) 327-8708.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AE2100D3 Engine Components Repair (C-130J) Survey</p>
<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification to repair the AE 2100D3 engine components. The AE 2100D3 engine is used on several military/civilian aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. Current and past acquisition strategies are based on the commercial nature of the engine and the fact that the government does not own the technical data. Rolls-Royce developed and owns all the technical data for the components being repaired. The USAF has held technical data purchase discussions with Rolls-Royce, and Rolls-Royce has been unwilling to sell or price the data. Repairs are not possible without this data. The C-130J AE 2100D3 engine technology remains unchanged. The C-130J is flown by the U.S. Government and various nations around the world. Changes within the market place have not occurred since the C-130J was inducted into service. Rolls-Royce (CAGE 63005) and its subcontracting partners own all the technical data for the AE 2100D3 engine and supporting spare parts. This acquisition will support the Iraq Air Force C-130J aircraft.</p>

The information provided may be used by the Army in developing a future acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). INTERESTED PARTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADEQUATELY MARKING PROPRIETARY OR COMPETITION SENSITIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THEIR RESPONSE. NOTE: All interested parties are encouraged to respond by submitting a white paper not to exceed 10 pages. The ideas presented in the white paper will be discussed and assessed by the U.S Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), Force Protection Systems on behalf of Software Engineering Center (SEC) and other Government agencies involved in the AIE Program. NOTE: The use of RFI Number W909MY-18-R-A009 is for tracking purposes only.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND/ DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is conducting market research on behalf of the U.S. Army CERDEC SEC and AIE program office, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities required to perform software technology upgrades, AIE system modifications, and installation at all AIE 2+ sites. Commercial software applications are reaching end of life or will no longer be supported. The AIE 2 + test lab, located at Ft. Hood Texas, will be used to test the solution prior to fielding. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services".</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>AIE 2+ has the need to upgrade from Windows 7 operating system to Windows 10 operating system platform; from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2, and Microsoft (MS) Structured Query Language (SQL) Server Enterprise 2008 to MS SQL Server Enterprise 2016; along with the capability to provide remote administration of system components for seamless integration into the existing AIE 2.1.5 Baseline. These proposed upgrades will require modifications to BAE System's and Iberon's propriety software currently residing in the AIE system. Iberon's NCITE &reg; PassControlTM solution is used for enrolling and vetting guests at U.S. Army Installations and DoD personnel to authoritative databases. This software solution interacts with BAE's Access Control Services software and the AIE databases to render the results of the vetting process to BAE's Lane Display Client for presentation to the vehicle lane guards at the Access Control Points (ACP). As part of AIE's long term support strategy, the Government plans to purchase all noncommercial software data rights to operate the system to include source code, compiled software, executable files, and script files. The contractor is to provide system documentation that includes the propriety software. The contractor is to deliver and install a copy of the development environment and structured training to CECOM SEC at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG). For this requirement, the Government does not own the rights to the BAE proprietary software currently being used to support the AIE system. The Contractor shall also provide support to the Government in setting up the Software Engineering Environment (SEE) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, where AIE 2.2 baseline will be sustained after the deployment.</p>
<p>There are special events on Army Installations that are open to the general public throughout the Unites States. The Army requires pre-registration capability accessible via the internet for visitors to submit visit request information for processing and receiving disposition notification prior to entering the Installation.</p>
<p>The solution must be integrated with the existing AIE 2 + system and undergo testing at the AIE lab at Ft. Hood, Texas prior to fielding at AIE 2 + Installations. The proposed integrated solution must meet the requirements of the existing system and retain the functionally and operational work flow as the existing AIE 2+ architecture.</p>
<p>The scope of effort includes, at a minimum, the design, development, installation, integration, test, and deployment of software and documentation with implementation of the requirements stated above (AIE 2.2 baseline). The Government's Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPRNET) will be the enterprise communication network over which data requests and data transfers will occur.</p>
<p>Interested potential sources should respond by identifying their capabilities and recent experience (last 5 years) in providing the scope of work identified above. This response should address: <br />a) demonstrated capability to develop and modify AIE 2 + system software from user defined requirements, <br />b) experience associated with DoD utilized access control systems, database management, and identity management systems, e.g. AIE, <br />c) ability to develop/define system software interface requirements and solutions, <br />d) experience implementing Army projects, <br />e) understanding of NIPRNET system communication requirements and capabilities,<br />f) familiarity with different sources of DoD personnel vetting data e.g., Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting (DEERS), Interoperability Layer Service (IoLS), etc. <br />g) development of middleware software designed to exchange information between multiple disparate systems, <br />h) software development risk mitigation techniques, <br />i) demonstrated ability and experience supporting DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF) effort, <br />j) experience and expertise developing, delivering and maintaining DoD and Army Standard net-centric solutions and web based services, <br />k) demonstrated experience developing and maintaining software in accordance with Institute of Electrical and Electronics (IEEE)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standard (STD). 12207 - Software Lifecycle Process.</p>

<DESC><br /><br />The U.S. Department of the Army, Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), Quality Evaluation Facility (QEF) is seeking information for service be provided to maintain the buildings operation on a Firm-Fixed Price basis.
<p>The Quality Evaluation Facility (QEF) currently houses, stores, and tests a variety of toxic chemicals. Mission driven safety precautions and regulatory guidance requires the QEF to maintain negative pressure and proper ventilation throughout its Toxic Lab Wing (TLW) with NO interruptions. The QEF's TLW is fitted with 11 filter units (9 Primary &amp; 2 Backup) for the removal of all toxic chemical vapor through laboratory fume hoods. This is a 24/7 requirement that must be maintained to provide a proper safe work environment as well as to maintain mission readiness. The QEF is also heavily reliant on its Chilled Water and Boiler Systems to control internal environmental conditions (humidity/temperature) for testing as well as storage of toxic chemicals. <br />All critical heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems being maintained at the QEF are currently controlled by KMC engineering controls (33 controllers' total). These controls monitor all HVAC activity and are programmed to report any critical failures via telephonic alarm, which would result in an Emergency Response to assess any critical failure(s). Preventative Maintenance checks and Emergency Response to the QEF's KMC controls are just as critical as failures to the HVAC systems themselves. Therefore the QEF requires the Contractor must be an "AUTHORIZED" KMC controls representative. <br />Critical failures to the QEF's KMC Controls and/or HVAC equipment will have a significantly negative impact on employee's safety and on meeting testing schedules to support the war fighter. Critical TLW HVAC failures would result in an estimated minimum of $25,000.00 to $30,000.00 per day due to the loss in ability to perform laboratory testing. Critical TLW HVAC failures lasting longer than 24 hours would also require First Entry Monitoring to clear the area and deem the area safe for re-entry.</p>
<p>A description of the types of maintenance, repair work and response required can be found in the attached SOW. The SOW also contains a Not All-Inclusive list of some of the equipment to be maintained.</p>
<p>Required Qualifications:</p>
<p>(a) Contractor MUST have documented experience with all the equipment listed in the SOW, including specifically the Ionex Filter units, Energy Lab AHUs, and York variable speed centrifugal chillers.<br />(b) Contractor MUST have a clear understanding of QEF procedures, and operating sequences.<br />(c) Contractor MUST be an authorized KMC controls representative and provide backup to show. This controls system operates all equipment listed above, and all operating sequences contained within.<br />(d) Due to the critical nature of the QEF, and the need for 24/7 continuous operations and monitoring, servicing contractor shall be able to respond to all calls within the designated times. Responses should include detail as to how the vendor will be able to respond to all calls and repairs in the designated times within the SOW.</p>
<p><br />All interested vendors that can meet the requirements exactly as set forth above and in the attached SOW are requested to submit responses in writing via electronic message with clear and convincing documentation as such, by 4 PM Central Time 18 Dec. 2017 to: U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, ATTN: CCRC-AE, Mr. Todd Kowalke, 3055 Rodman Avenue, Rock Island, IL, 61299, Todd.W.Kowalke.Civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>I. DISCLAIMER:
<p>a. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). Information on the specific topics of interest is provided in the following sections of this announcement. Neither the CMDS Project Office nor any other part of the Federal Government will be responsible for any cost incurred by responders in furnishing this information.<br />b. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, "fire-and-forget", short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. It provides low-altitude defense for ground forces against attack or aerial observation by low-flying Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Cruise Missile, Rotary Wing, and Fixed-Wing threats. The missile utilizes a high explosive, hit-to-kill warhead. Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles and helicopters.</p>
<p>The Stinger Virtual Trainer (SVT) will replace the Stinger Troop Proficiency Trainer (STPT). The STPT provides interactive three-dimensional (3D) simulations of tactical engagement sequences and delivers the gunners with the basic technical skills required to successfully engage targets with the Stinger weapon system. There are two main components of the STPT's hardware, an Instructor Station and a Student Station. The Instructor Station is a personal computer, running the latest Windows operating system that drives the student station. The Student Station hardware replicates the Stinger weapon with a simulated terrain scene that reacts to the operation and orientation of the launch tube. During exercise sessions, various combinations of targets are presented that follow pre-set routes across the terrain. The gunner observes and tracks the targets through the Sight Assembly and performs a variety of tasks to engage those targets, as determined by the particular requirements of each exercise. The system evaluates the trainee throughout the whole firing procedure. The Instructor Station automatically scores certain aspects of gunner performance (tracking score, hit/miss, etc.), while the instructor scores other aspects manually (scanning the sector, target prioritization, etc.). As part of the after action report, the computer will note incorrect actions performed by the trainee; for example: fired at a friendly target; failed to properly super elevate; failed to hold fire trigger for three seconds; failed to remove the Battery Coolant Unit (BCU) after firing; and, failed to identify the IFF target before engagement. The size, weight and feel of the STPT system closely mimic the real Stinger weapon system. The system is designed to be disassembled for ease of storage without the need of hand tools. The STPT housing is made primarily out of aluminum and was designed to withstand the hazards of frequent transport and field use. The display used to represent the terrain scene is a high-resolution color Liquid-Crystal Display (LCD) display in a ruggedized custom enclosure. The virtual horizon is an actual photograph of real locations utilizing stereoscopic imaging to create depth perception while maintaining real-time feedback to the gunner's inputs from his position in the battlefield. The operator can traverse 180 degrees, viewing the virtual battlefield.</p>
<p>III. SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:</p>
<p>The CMDS Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide Stinger Virtual Trainers (SVT).</p>
<p>Stinger Virtual Trainer<br />The purpose of the SVT is to provide initial gunnery training and to provide sustainment training of engagement skills for the Stinger Man-Portable Air-Defense System (MANPADS) weapon system. Using the latest commercially available hardware and software, the SVT provides a reliable, effective, low-cost training solution for Stinger firing procedures under battle conditions. Providing interactive three-dimensional (3D) simulations of tactical engagement sequences, the device delivers the gunners with the basic technical skills required to successfully engage targets with the Stinger weapon system.</p>
<p>The SVT shall provide a means for viewing targets through a virtual or physical sight assembly including an accurate sight aperture and range ring. It shall include a model of the Stinger Gripstock Assembly with the following elements:<br />1. Physical design the matches the tactical gripstock with accurate placement of the battery/coolant unit (BCU) cap, firing switch, safety and actuate switch, identification friend or foe (IFF) switch, and uncage switch.<br />2. Training for proper insertion of the BCU at the beginning of an engagement and its removal and replacement at the end of an engagement. <br />3. Safety and actuate switch to simulate activating the BCU and the seeker. <br />4. Uncage switch for simulating uncaging of the seeker head. <br />5. IFF interrogator switch for identifying friendly aircraft during the engagement process. <br />6. Fire trigger for simulated firing of the missile.</p>
<p>The engagement process of targets on the SVT shall be similar to the process of engaging targets on the Stinger MANPADS in that: <br />1. The BCU must be properly inserted and remain inserted throughout the engagement. <br />2. The total time of the engagement, beginning when the Safety and Actuate switch is pressed through completion, shall be limited to the expected duration of a BCU.<br />3. The gunner shall be able track targets by looking through the sight aperture and range ring of the sight assembly.<br />4. The gunner shall be able to perform superelevation and lead targets using the sight aperture portion of sight assembly.<br />5. When the IFF Interrogator switch is pressed by the gunner, the gunner shall hear the appropriate IFF tone response through the SVT audio system.<br />6. The seeker must be uncaged and locked onto a target in order to hit the target.<br />7. The uncage switch and fire switch must be held simultaneously for at least half a second in order to fire a missile on the SVT. Any less than this amount shall result in a hang-fire.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM
<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) Exchange (hereinafter called the "Exchange"), located at NASA's John H. Glenn Research Center ("GRC"), 21000 Brookpark Road in Cleveland Ohio, is seeking information about potential methods for providing food services at GRC.</p>
<p>Although this Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes, selection of a food services provider may also be determined based on the responses of interested parties to this RFI. This request for information does not commit the Exchange to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Potential offerors are advised that the Exchange will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Exchange is a non-appropriated federal instrumentality (NAFI), which exists for the benefit of the NASA employees who work at GRC. The Exchange administers and manages operations and activities that create revenue which helps finance activities created to contribute to the efficiency, welfare, and morale of NASA employees. The majority of the GRC workforce is on the day shift and has flexible scheduling available. The Food Service Program (FSP) is an essential service among the GRC Exchange responsibilities and activities and a contributing force in the continuing well-being and effectiveness of the GRC workforce. Food service contributes to the social environment of the Center and plays a role in the recruitment, retention and overall satisfaction of its workforce. The current food services agreement under the Exchange will end on December 15, 2017. In addition to the food services agreement under the Exchange, vending routes at various sites on Center are operated by a separate vendor under a separate agreement and these vending routes will remain in operation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to assist the Exchange in designing and maintaining the FSP and operation of the coffee kiosk that meets the needs and enhances the quality of life for the GRC workforce. It is expected that the FSP meet the following objectives (in no particular order):</p>
<p>&bull;	To provide a variety of appetizing and nutritionally sound food options and styles of cuisine that support employees' diverse needs and enhance their dining experiences;<br />&bull;	To provide convenient operating hours which are responsive to the needs of the GRC workforce; and<br />&bull;	To maintain efficient and effective operations while keeping costs at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>The Exchange is open to fulfilling its FSP through any of the following (or combination): Traditional cafeteria, Food court, Food trucks, Restaurant (branded or unbranded), catering, delivery service, coffee kiosk or self-serve coffee, etc. Potential offerors are welcome to propose additional alternatives.</p>
<p>Site Description and Site Visit</p>
<p>NASA GRC&lsquo;s Lewis Field is a 350-acre site adjacent to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. For the purpose of this RFI, it should be noted that within a ten-mile radius of GRC's Lewis Field there are two shopping malls with food courts and full services restaurants as well as a multitude of other fast food and full-service restaurants away from the malls.</p>
<p>GRC's Lewis Field includes more than 150 buildings that contain a unique collection of world-class test facilities. There is one generally centrally located cafeteria at Lewis Field.</p>
<p>The cafeteria kitchen is a fully equipped professional kitchen (a tour of the kitchen and available equipment will be available during the site visits).</p>
<p>The coffee kiosk is located in the lobby of an adjacent building from the cafeteria. It is complete with cooler display and storage areas as well as coffee and specialty beverage equipment and dining areas.  Full service coffee kiosk could offer specialty coffee, beverages, teas, pastries, snacks, sandwiches, etc.</p>
<p><br />SITE VISIT: GRC will hold a site visit on December 20, 2017 at 3 p.m. EST to allow potential offerors an opportunity to visit the cafeteria and kitchen and to speak with GRC representatives.</p>
<p>Those companies wishing to attend the Site Visit SHALL submit a visitor request via email to the Contracting Officer: James.R.Griffin@nasa.gov  No Later than 2:30 p.m. on 12/19/17.</p>

Visitors are required to present the photo identification: Driver's License and/or State Issued Identification Card upon arrival at Security. Please note that if a current and valid form of government-issued photo identification cannot be presented, access to the Center will be denied.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p>In order to provide potential offerors with a complete picture the following challenges or potential challenges have been identified:</p>
<p>&bull;	Although the GRC population exceeds 3000 individuals (which includes civil servants and contractors), currently only approximately 12% of these individuals use the cafeteria on a daily basis (this number fluctuates based on the season, i.e. more in the summer, fewer in the winter)<br />&bull;	The campus and workforce are spread out geographically<br />&bull;	Parking at or near the cafeteria is limited<br />&bull;	Any issued agreement(s) would be subject to the Service Contract Act<br />&bull;	The cafeteria is scheduled to be relocated to new building in 2020 <br />&bull;	Compliance with all food safety requirements including ServSafe IV certifications, adhering to all food handling standards and periodic inspections, and providing necessary documentation for training records and physical exams administered to food handlers</p>

<RESPDATE>122217
<CONTACT>Robert E. Seeger, Email robert.e.seeger@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-265 (Program Office for F/A-18 and EA-18G Aircraft), is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to design, develop and manufacture a Deployable Flight Incident Recorder (DFIR), a.k.a. Voice and Aircraft Data Recorder (VADR) for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) aircraft. Prospective contractors should take note that unlike standard commercial derivative crash-survivable VADRs, this specific DFIR must be able to be deployed from the aircraft via Cartridge Actuated Device during a mishap, and must be able to survive terminal velocity ground impact as well as maintain flotation in the open ocean for an indefinite period of time in addition to other standard qualification requirements for military aircraft applications. The Boeing Company is the aircraft manufacturer of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G, performed the integration engineering of the current DFIR into the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G, and as such possesses the requisite technical data, knowledge, and special skills regarding the DFIR aircraft integration to meet the Navy's requirements. DRS Leonardo (Canada) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of the F/A-18 DFIR, and as such possesses the requisite technical data, knowledge, and special skills regarding the design and operation (including aircraft data collection and homing beacon) to meet the Navy's requirements. The contractor shall be responsible for obtaining, from Boeing and or DRS Leonardo, all manufacturing drawings and proprietary specification data necessary to support the production of a DFIR.
<p>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirements as stated in this synopsis. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. Vendors can additionally provide a capabilities statement of no more than 1 page in length that demonstrates the respondent's ability to meet the requirements as specified herein, including the delivery schedule requirements. The Government is interested in receiving vendors' commercial published price lists for items they believe meet the need in this RFI. The Government is also interested in lead-time and current stock level. All data received in response to this RFI, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information. All responses, including capability statements, shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM EST, 22 December 2017. Responses shall be submitted electronically to the designated Contract Specialist, Robert Seeger, in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) at the following email address: robert.e.seeger@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.<br />SS-H-2018-012
<p>This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.</p>
<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code(s) 519130, and the Small Business Standard is 1,000 employees, PSC Code D317, for an on-line subscription to help comply with statutory requirements regarding Capital Ratios, Budget Re-estimates, Credit Reforms, and Credit Risk Analysis. Providing the coverage, depth, scope, accuracy and format in a single source subscription and is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements. <br />Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research.<br />Please review the statement of work (SOW) and provide your feedback to Ms. Diane Toledo-Gaskins at diane.e.toledo-gaskins@hud.gov. Please call 202-402-4140 if there are questions. Please reference SS-H-2018-012</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures an average of approximately $40 billion in multifamily rental projects each year. In doing so, it evaluates the market absorption potential for these projects and how they relate to existing projects in the market. HUD has two objectives. One is to avoid financing projects in markets where it is anticipated there will be an excess supply of rental units by the time the project is completed, thereby reducing the risk of default for the proposed project. The other is to avoid increasing vacancy levels above desired levels in the market to reduce the risk to financial viability of existing rental projects, some of whose mortgages HUD may have insured.</p>
<p>Most of HUD's multifamily mortgage business is concentrated in metropolitan areas, especially large, fast-growing areas. Detailed information on the location, type, rents, and vacancy rates of existing and newly developed multifamily rental projects is highly valuable in estimating the impacts and potential absorption of rental projects applying for HUD mortgage insurance or subsidy assistance. A limited amount of rental vacancy rate data is available from the Bureau of the Census. This information is collected in greater detail for multifamily rental projects by a limited number of firms that sell it to interested parties in a standardized format. HUD is interested in purchasing such data to assist it in carrying out its market analysis functions. <br />GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br />The vendor shall furnish the following services:<br />I. Housing Market Analysis Data<br />All rent comparability, submarket and metropolitan market report for 165 primary, secondary and tertiary metropolitan multifamily markets, including quarterly executive- level summary data, rankings and analyses on U.S. and regional markets, as well as a variety of special research studies. For the 50 primary metropolitan markets, this data includes:<br />A. Details on supply, demand, vacancies, rents, and related market indicators on metropolitan markets for the multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Submarket-level detail for multifamily, office and retail markets are included. Annual and quarterly trends are presented, along with five-year forecasts. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.<br />B. Metropolitan market and submarket details on supply, demand, rents and vacancies for Class A and B/C properties for the multifamily and office sectors. Annual and quarterly trends are presented. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) formats.<br />C. Aggregate and property-specific rent comp group reports including rents and vacancies, in addition to five-year historical trends for aggregate rent comp groups for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.<br />D. Individual property sales, including transaction and property characteristics for multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Updated weekly.<br />E. Economic and real estate analysis in narrative form on most metropolitan areas. The reports discuss key multifamily, office, retail and industrial supply and demand trends in each metropolitan market, pinpoint under-performing and outperforming submarkets. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format.<br />F. Current market indicators across all submarkets in each metropolitan market, including rents, vacancies, free rent concessions, and expenses for multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) format.<br />G. Building-level listings and summary statistics for submarkets and metropolitan markets are presented of planned/proposed, projects under construction and recently completed for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly.<br />H. Daily real estate and economic stories are posted from the leading local newspapers and periodicals across the nation, initially coded into relevant metropolitan markets and topic categories (e.g. multifamily construction). A searchable 90-day archive is maintained. Updated daily. Available in an HTML format.<br />II. Data Files<br />EXCEL data files with supply demand and rent time series data (from 1980 in most<br />markets) for the Primary Markets and selected market aggregations are extractable for all database variables for the 30 secondary metropolitan markets data and reports provided in the following: <br />(a), but without the forecasts;<br />(c), but without the historical trends; and<br />(g) and (h) are available.<br />For the 85-tertiary metropolitan markets the information provided is the same as for the secondary markets, with less submarket details and historical data is limited to the past 3-4 years.<br />III. Sales Comp Module<br />A database of apartment transactions valued at $2 million or more in all 80 primary and secondary markets and for 85 tertiary markets.<br />IV. Transaction Analytics Module<br />This is a database that includes sales transaction activity. It provides mean, median and 12-month-rolling cap rates, sales price data by price per unit or square foot, and total transaction volume. Transaction trends are available by quarter back to 2005 for metropolitan areas, regions, and the U.S. This module also provides data on top deals, with buyer and seller information, and on key submarket transaction activity. HUD will use this information to identify sales and capital market trends in the multifamily real estate market and assess troubled debt.<br />V. Single Property Valuation Tool<br />Allows the user to enter their assumptions or observations on current building performance, select a variety of forecast options based on observations and predictions at the submarket and metro levels, and select some final assumptions in terms of terminal cap rates, additional income and other variable affecting property value. The result is three distinct market values based on the DCF, Sales Comp and Direct Cap methodologies.<br />VI. Expanding Markets<br />Currently FHA has access to 200 apartment markets throughout the United States. With this acquisition HUD will have access to an additional 75 markets.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</strong> <br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Nonetheless, submitters should properly mark their responses if the information is "business confidential" or "proprietary information." Further, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission other than acknowledgment of receipt, should the submitter request an acknowledgement. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's (DNDO) singular mission is to prevent nuclear terrorism. DNDO continually develops and procures radiation detection equipment for deployment by DHS and assists state/local/tribal law enforcement entities to protect and strengthen various pathways through which global commerce travels.</p>
<p>Personal Radiation Detectors (PRDs) are pager-size devices worn by users for radiological and nuclear detection capability as well as personal protection. PRDs automatically monitor the environment and alert the user when radiation levels above the natural background are detected. PRDs also assist the user in localizing the source of detected radiation. The high sensitivity and rapid response time to the variations in the ambient radiation levels clearly distinguish PRDs from the family of electronic dosimeters which are mainly used for accurate dose and dose rate to which the individual is exposed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE OF RFI</strong></p>
<p>DNDO recently conducted a competitive acquisition of general purpose and maritime PRDs during which proposed systems were subjected to government performance and environmental testing (HSHQDN-17-R-0003). No Maritime Variant device was selected for award because all proposed devices failed one or more Key Performance Parameters (KPP) in Attachment 1. Thus, DNDO seeks information whether any Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Maritime Variant PRD that has been updated or not included in the original competition can meet all of the KPPs. Performance claims should be support and verified through independent testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>In response to this RFI, interested parties should provide the following information regarding their PRD device(s):</p>
<p>&bull; Picture of the device.</p>
<p>&bull; A technical description of the device. This may include product literature, full product specifications, or other documents.</p>
<p>&bull; Indicate whether the device meets or does not meet the requirements in Attachment 1. For entries where "Meets" is indicated, specify Threshold (T) or Objective (O). For entries of "Does Not Meet" provide a brief explanation as to why the device does not meet the requirement or to what extent it does meet the requirement. The government will assess the degree to which the device meets or exceeds the requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; If the device was submitted during the last Request for Proposal (RFP) HSHQDN-17-R-0003 and was unsuccessful, please explain what upgrades were made to the device that would allow it to pass an independent test campaign this time.</p>
<p>&bull; Substantiating evidence to support statements that the PRD meets the KPPs in the form of test reports or certifications performed by 1) a government agency, 2) accredited laboratory, 3) independent laboratory, or 4) third party not affiliated with the vendor of the device will be valued in descending order for verification purposes. Any test reports should include the test date, test location, system configuration version under test, test plans, and test data/results. The test facility's qualifications in performing the test (i.e., certification, accreditation, etc.) should also be listed.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought and is for informational purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is currently available. This request does not obligate the Government in any contact award. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. Do not submit cost proposals or cost information. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit a proposal if and when a solicitation is issued. <br />
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Pittsburgh District, is conducting market research to determine the business size and capabilities of potential sources for stabilization of cracks on existing middle lock wall at the Montgomery Locks and Dam, Ohio River, Pennsylvania. The proposed NAICS for the proposed acquisition is 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.</p>
<p>The information gathered will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to stabilize two critical sections of the middle wall where serious issues have been occurring at the Montgomery Locks and Dam, Ohio River, Pennsylvania. Montgomery Locks and Dam is located on the Ohio River near Monaca PA, at river mile 31.7 below the "Point" in Pittsburgh, PA. The locks are open to commercial navigation and recreation traffic, which are staffed and operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The facility has two lock chambers with the locks located on the left descending bank. The land lock chamber has a size of 110'x600' and the river lock chamber has a size of 56'x360'. The existing middle lock wall supports the continual operation of the two lock chambers at the facility. The lock walls are constructed of concrete walls bearing directly on the rock for foundation support. <br />Existing cracks are located with many areas of the lock walls. The cracks are orientated vertically and horizontally within the lock walls with water leakage occurring from the cracks.</p>
<p>Required work requirements as part of the crack stabilization will include:</p>
<p>1. Installation of steel stressing high capacity rock/concrete anchors within the lock wall with the following specifications,</p>
<p>a. The anchors will be around 20 to 22 feet long to prevent the anchor hole from penetrating past the back side of the lock wall which will be of upmost importance that the penetration does not occur. The nominal lock wall concrete width is 24 feet.</p>
<p>b. The anchors will be required to be installed horizontally through the width of the lock wall at multiple horizontal planes within the lock walls. Approximately 45 ASTM A722 galvanized 1.25-inch diameter high capacity anchors are required with an expandable mechanical wedge on one end of the anchor and a bearing plate for seating the anchor stressing loads onto the concrete lock wall.</p>
<p>c. Holes for the high capacity anchors will be required to be core drilled on a near horizontal arrangement from the vertical lock wall face within the land lock chamber. It is the Contractor's responsibility to determine the equipment, means and methods to best drill holes. It is anticipated the holes will be drilled off a temporary floating barge platform with floating plant, fixed or elevated platform or other methods that will achieve the approximate 2.5-inch hole diameter and horizontal alignment for the anchor.</p>
<p>d. The anchor heads with the bearing plate will be required to be recessed within in a larger sized hole or recess opening at a nominal depth within the vertical lock wall. This recess will be filled with grout to protect and encapsulate anchor head.</p>
<p>e. The anchors will be stressed at two different intervals and each of the anchor groups will be stressed according to a specified sequence pattern to provide to an initial stress and final lock off stress for each anchor. Stressing and grouting of the high capacity anchor could be done using a floating plant or another means for the Contractor to determine.</p>
<p>2. Scheduling of the anchor installation.</p>
<p>a. The anchor installation must occur during specified multiple temporary lock closures in order to minimize the time the land lock chamber is closed. The Contractor must develop a detailed schedule to perform the work in a timely manner during these multiple temporary closures. It is anticipated the work must occur within a maximum 12-hour temporary daily lock closure period and within the planned Government maintenance 16-hour daily shutdown period scheduled to occur simultaneously over a part of the contract period of performance. Daily equipment set-ups and removals will be required as part of the contract work. A floating plant mooring area will be provided to the Contractor for performance of the contract work.</p>
<p>3. After the completion of the anchor installations, the existing cracks will be required to be pressure grouted to seal the water leakage. This pressure grouting will be performed from inside the existing gallery opening containing the lock service utilities and from vertical wall recesses opening using specialized grouting equipment. This will require the Contractor to select the appropriate grouting methods, pressures and techniques to successfully seal the cracks.

US Department of Veterans Affairs
VistA Imaging Hardware, Software and Services
Request for Information (RFI)

Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation, nor does it restrict the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to any acquisition approaches described in this document.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by VA to form a binding contract.
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors that can meet VA s requirements to expand the existing VistA Imaging storage environment which is comprised of brand name Hewlett Packard (HP) Hardware and Laurel Bridge Software (LBS).  The acquisition of HP servers, HP drives, HP controllers, and Laurel Bridge Licenses will ensure interoperability and compatibility with the existing VistA Imaging System across the enterprise.  The current VistA Imaging systems are installed locally in various sized VA medical facilities, grouped into 21 geographical Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), all of which acquire, store and retrieve medical image files in the course of their daily operations. Currently, the most active large VA medical facility utilizes approximately one Terabyte (TB) of storage per month, which is over twice what a typical large sized facility consumes.  Some large VA medical facilities may be considered small, as they consume less than 50 gigabytes (GB) per month. 
The FDA has classified the VistA Imaging System as a Class I exempt medical device, and the use of VistA Imaging in a clinical setting is subject to the Quality System Regulation of the  FDA under CFR ) Title 21 Part 820 and other Federal legislation. Therefore, All Vista Imaging Solution System Hardware and Software to be acquired under this effort MUST be listed on the VA Vista Imaging Program Offices list of FDA 510K Medical Device certified configurations.
As part of this RFI, VA seeks to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the requirements captured in this document.  VA is not responsible for any costs incurred by the RFI respondents in furnishing this information.  Thus, all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent s expense.  A lack of response to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All RFI responses become Government property and will not be returned to the respondents.  Please do not submit a proposal or quotation.  VA requests that all respondents shall note their interest and provide information on their respective capabilities to potentially satisfy the requirements captured in the attachments.
Scope of Work
The Contractor shall provide VA integrated hardware, software, documentation, and incidental services necessary to augment VistA Imaging Tier I solutions currently deployed throughout the Enterprise.  Incidental services include management, site assessment, installation, testing, training, warranty and maintenance services.  
To meet their requirement, the VA is seeking to procure the following HP hardware and Laurel Bridge software (as detailed in Attachment A) in the estimated quantities listed to expand the existing VistA Imaging storage environment  The acquisition of HP servers, HP drives, HP controllers, and Laurel Bridge Licenses will ensure interoperability and compatibility with the existing VistA Imaging System:

<DESC><p><strong>Solicitation Number: RFI-AFRL-RIK-18-01</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice Type</strong>: Special Notice</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Requests for Information (RFI) For Ternary Computing Architectures<br /><br /><strong>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME</strong>: Department of Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p><strong>1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</strong>. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 FEEDBACK</strong>. Submission of an abstract is voluntary. Respondents are advised that AFRL is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 REGULATORY GUIDANCE</strong>. This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), "RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract."</p>
<p><strong>2.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</span></strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is seeking information to better understand existing vendor offerings and the landscape of research and development (R&amp;D) towards ternary computing.</p>
<p>The Air Force is investigating ternary computing architectures, hardware and software, to determine if such radical architectural and infrastructural changes could disrupt the status quo and support a healthier cyber-security ecosystem through computational diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Challenge</strong>: Current approaches to cyber-security tend to be reactive rather pro-active. Hackers, and cyber-criminals continuously probe and attack legacy infrastructure that was often not designed with security in mind. In addition, the layers of assurance that are added to our systems after-the-fact are themselves susceptible to the same attacks they are attempting to protect against.</p>
<p>The paradigm of research that creates architectures for general purpose computing also needs to be revisited due to the increase of highly specialized computing problems. This is driving a need for full heterogeneous hardware platforms that utilize multiple, highly specialized, innovative computer architectures. In this new paradigm, hardware advances should no longer be evaluated on their general purpose advantages, but rather should be evaluated on their utility for addressing specific computing problems and interoperability in a diverse computing ecosystem. We would like to consider if advances in microelectronics now make the fabrication and implementation of ternary components feasible, if the supporting ternary protocols and logic can be created, and if any of this can be used to increase cyber security.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ABSTRACTS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTENT</span></strong></p>

<SUBJECT>Notification of New Policy for Science Mission Directorate Class-D Missions
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDA003L
<CONTACT>Gregory L. Robinson, Email gregory.l.robinson@nasa.gov
<DESC>Class-D missions are a crucial part of the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) mission portfolio, even though they are typically at lower cost than other missions and at low national priority. They provide an ideal platform for technological and architecture innovation and are a training ground for a diverse set of scientists and engineers. Class-D missions are also well-suited for novel partnership models between NASA and the commercial sector. These missions are thus a critical part of the SMD mission portfolio, but only if their management processes are aligned with their overall goals.  For that reason, SMD has pursued a streamlined process for implementing Class-D missions that recognizes their unique and important role in SMD's mission portfolio. <br /> <br />As a result of this work, SMD is issuing a new policy documenting the principles and approach that will guide the implementation of Class-D missions under $150M lifecycle cost, not including launch vehicles, going forward.  This new approach is a tailoring/streamlining of how SMD executes space flight projects per NPR 8705.4, Risk Classification for NASA Payloads (Updated w/change 3); NPR 7120.5, NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements w/Changes 1-15; and the SMD Management Handbook.  This policy is effective January 1, 2018, for all applicable projects that have not reached Key Decision Point-C (KDP-C) as of that date.<br /><br />The full text of the new policy is available: https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/ClassD.html <br /><br />SMD will be hosting a discussion of the new policy during the 2017 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans, LA.  The town hall is scheduled for Thursday, December 14, 2017, at 6:15pm CST.<br /><br />SMD will also host a discussion for interested industry representatives at 1:00pm EST on January 3, 2018, at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC.<br />

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source:<br /><br />1. Solicitation Number W912P7-18-Q-0002
<p>2. Sole Source Title: Analysis of micro-plastics in fish tissue in an aquatic environment.</p>
<p>3. Monterey Bay Aquarium&nbsp;Research Institute&nbsp;(MBARI)</p>
<p>4. Contracting Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District</p>
<p>5. San Francisco, California</p>
<p>6. Description:</p>
<p>General Project Description: The overall Objective of this agreement is to provide technical services to support the US Army Corps of Engineers (US ACE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency to provide trophic level assessments required for identification of bio transport of micro-plastics in the marine environment.</p>
<p>Project Background: <br /><br />Micro-plastics generated from the environmental degradation of manufactured plastic products may be a possible pathway for the contamination of fish tissue with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and plasticizers. At the Tern Island case micro-plastic is commonly ingested by animals. As described above, micro-plastic particles act a media for transfer of contaminants into the food web. A trophic evaluation study is needed to determine the bio-accumulatory extent of, and contaminant behavior in, marine food webs associated with the endangered Hawaiian monk seal. <br />MBARI will provide a plan and assessment of available samples and approaches for evaluating the trophic transfer of plastic-related contaminants (both additives and sorbed chemicals) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Island (NWHI) marine ecosystem, as potentially linked to marine regions contaminated with micro-plastics and other anthropogenic debris. This project will have two principal components:<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; A literature survey detailing what is known about the structure and function of the marine food webs of the NWHI open ocean ecosystem, as centered on the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) in the vicinity of French Frigate Shoals (Tern Island). <br /><br />&bull; Second, a detailed survey and cataloging effort of biological samples/specimens from the NWHI ecosystem (preferably from French Frigate Shoals) that could be used in a broader trophic study aimed at evaluating bio-accumulation and bio-magnification of PCB contamination of marine organisms resulting from exposure to micro-plastics and/or plasticizers.<br /><br />Dr. Choy will travel to the State of Hawaii and meet with researchers and managers to 1) inventory their sample collections, 2) physically identify any available samples, 3) survey researcher and manager willingness to provide available samples to the USEPA and 4) identify future sample collection needs based on trophic level sample gaps and 5) survey researchers and managers' willingness to provide future samples to USEPA (using existing/new collection permits).</p>
<p><strong>Task 1: MBARI Trophic Level Analysis and Report<br /></strong><br />The agreement consists of two primary analysis tasks to be conducted by MBARI.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SubTask 1.1: Engage with Partners for Sample Identification, Permitting, and Acquisition</span><br /><br />First, this task requires identifying the appropriate contacts with which to inquire with USEPA partners (including but not limited to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration / Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources) regarding already collected and potentially available, trophically relevant biological samples from oceanic waters of or surrounding Tern Island/French Frigate Shoals. Secondly, following contact and engagement with appropriate contacts, set up meetings to request and acquire samples for consideration in future trophic studies.<br /><br />This task will require travel to Hawaii, following direct inquiry and communication with said partners, and could require a total of 5-10 days for inquiry and 5-10 business days during travel for sample acquisition. This task may require an additional trip to search partner freezers and warehouses for appropriate samples and to then, catalog and inventory available samples and research appropriate permit regulations associated with collected samples.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SubTask 1.2: Sample Planning &amp; Literature Synthesis of NWHI Marine Ecosystem Food Web</strong><br /></span><br />Using the information collected from partner organizations and from a detailed literature synthesis, MBARI will determine "gaps" in in the proposed trophic level analysis and evaluate potential opportunities in which additional samples could be provisioned and collaboratively collected. The central objective of Analysis SubTask 1.2 is for MBARI to prepare a Trophic Level diagram for the Hawaiian monk seal food web within their French Frigate Shoals habitat.<br /><br />Regarding total numbers of samples for this trophic study USEPA guidance is provided in Document EPA 823-B-00-007, "Guidance for assessing chemical contaminant data <br />for use in fish advisories". Generally, USEPA recommends analyzing replicate composite samples of target species at each sampling site of concern. We are aiming to characterize contaminant levels in three distinct trophic levels (herbivores or zooplanktivores, benthic carnivores or piscivores, apex predators), targeting a minimum of 5 "small" and 5 "large" marine organisms (replicates) for each trophic level.<br /><br />Study design and Quality Assurance/Quality Control issues will be addressed in a summary report to be submitted by MBARI to EPA after the project is completed. The report will include: 1) existing information on available samples with various partner organizations including taxonomy, 2) a "Monk Seal" trophic level diagram that outlines the ecological role of each animal and identifies potential holes in the trophic level study, 3) recommendations for filling study gaps, 4) recommendations on adequate sample resolution (e.g., size/volume/mass and number of samples) for proposed analyses such as stable-isotope, tissue contaminant burden and particle ingestion, 5) any additional recommendations. MBARI will work closely with EPA to optimize the <br />future study design with the goal of designing an executable sampling and analysis plan.<br /><br />7. Scope and Purpose: The overall Objective of this agreement is to provide technical services to support the US Army Corps of Engineers (US ACE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency to provide trophic level assessments required for identification of bio transport of micro-plastics in the marine environment.</p>

----------------------------------------------------------

This announcement is released by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics (OPAL), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), to notify Industry of a Medical Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) 2.0, Industry Day to be held on November 29, 2017, from 9:00 AM until approximately 1:00 PM at the Waterford Reception Center in Springfield VA, 6715 Commerce St, Springfield VA 22150. This event will focus on an upcoming VA acquisition opportunity, MSPV 2.0, regarding the capability, capacity, and viability of US businesses that provide product supply chain end-to-end management. This would include ordering and logistics management for medical supplies and equipment to ensure that all VA medical facilities have the supplies and equipment needed to provide the best care to our Veterans. Currently, MSPV requirements are executed at the local level via a variety of government purchase cards, contracts and a distribution prime vendor utilizing manual processes with limited IT tools. A potential requirement is that an interested vendor would be responsible for developing a medical surgical supply and equipment formulary for each facility in VA (see attached Statement of Objectives), provide strategic sourcing, life cycle management, distribution, inventory management and analysis services, quality control/quality assurance support services, and warranty management services.

The MSPV 2.0 Industry Day will offer numerous networking opportunities to include discussions with VA program and subject matter experts regarding initiating and conducting business with VA regarding this requirement.

This announcement is released by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics (OPAL), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), to notify Industry of a Medical Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) 2.0, Industry Day to be held on November 29, 2017, from 9:00 AM until approximately 1:00 PM at the Waterford Reception Center in Springfield VA, 6715 Commerce St, Springfield VA 22150. This event will focus on an upcoming VA acquisition opportunity, MSPV 2.0, regarding the capability, capacity, and viability of US businesses that provide product supply chain end-to-end management. This would include ordering and logistics management for medical supplies and equipment to ensure that all VA medical facilities have the supplies and equipment needed to provide the best care to our Veterans. Currently, MSPV requirements are executed at the local level via a variety of government purchase cards, contracts and a distribution prime vendor utilizing manual processes with limited IT tools. A potential requirement is that an interested vendor would be responsible for developing a medical surgical supply and equipment formulary for each facility in VA (see attached Statement of Objectives), provide strategic sourcing, life cycle management, distribution, inventory management and analysis services, quality control/quality assurance support services, and warranty management services.

The MSPV 2.0 Industry Day will offer numerous networking opportunities to include discussions with VA program and subject matter experts regarding initiating and conducting business with VA regarding this requirement. 

Registration for the VA s MSPV 2.0 Industry Day is required and must be completed no later than Friday, November 24, 2017. To register online, click here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/medical-surgical-prime-vendor-mspv-20-industry-day-tickets-39527663305?aff=eac2.

All topic-related questions, registration issues or inquiries may be sent to Brian.love@va.gov, Melissa.lera@va.gov, and David.barber3@va.gov. 

Attendance is limited to two (2) persons per company. Registration is accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, until capacity. Presentation of registration confirmation/acknowledgement will be required at check-in.

Doors will open at 8:00 AM for check-in and networking prior to the event starting at 09:00 AM.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes.

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Chest Tube Drainage Systems. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Chest Tube Drainage Systems products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Chest Tube Drainage Systems in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Chest Tube Drainage Systems will be established approximately May 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Chest Tube Drainage Systems. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Chest Tube Drainage Systems.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chest Tube Drainage Systems. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $716,721.55. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 93.07% ($684,818.39) of the total volume in sales ($716,721.55). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought Notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought Notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong>
<p>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4.

Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor offered products shall be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. </strong>Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin.

For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<strong> <br /><br /></strong>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Transparent Occlusive Dressing in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Transparent Occlusive Dressing will be established approximately May 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Transparent Occlusive Dressing. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Transparent Occlusive Dressing.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transparent Occlusive Dressing. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $654,335.89. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Six items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 98.70% ($645,893.09) of the total volume in sales ($654,335.89).

Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Lab Coats, Disposable will be established approximately May 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Lab Coats, Disposable. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Lab Coats, Disposable.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Lab Coats, Disposable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $561,865. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Ten items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% ($561,865) of the total volume in sales ($561,865). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought Notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought Notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought Notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong>
<p>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for.

Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor offered products shall be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered. Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification.</strong> Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011&nbsp; Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.&nbsp;SUPPLIES/SERVICE&nbsp;QUANTITY&nbsp;UNIT&nbsp;UNIT PRICE&nbsp;AMOUNT<br />0001&nbsp;Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse&nbsp;20&nbsp;EA&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.&nbsp;SUPPLIES/SERVICE&nbsp;QUANTITY&nbsp;UNIT&nbsp;UNIT PRICE&nbsp;AMOUNT<br />0001&nbsp;Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse&nbsp;20&nbsp;EA&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />0002&nbsp;Monitor&nbsp;20&nbsp;EA&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>

<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Requests for Equitable Adjustment (OCT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The amount of any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms shall accurately reflect the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable. The request shall include only costs for performing the change. All indirect costs included in the request shall be properly allocable to the change in accordance with applicable acquisition regulations.</p>
<p>(b)	Any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold shall bear, at the time of submission, the following certificate executed by an individual authorized to certify the request on behalf of the Contractor:</p>
<p>I certify that the request is made in good faith, and that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>___________________________<br /> (Official's Name)</p>
<p>___________________________<br /> (Title)</p>
<p>(c)	The certification in paragraph (b) of this clause requires full disclosure of all relevant facts, including:</p>
<p>(1)	Certified cost or pricing data, if required, in accordance with subsection 15.403-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); and</p>
<p>(2)	Data other than certified cost or pricing data, in accordance with subsection 15.403-3 of the FAR, including actual cost data and data to support any estimated costs, even if certified cost or pricing data are not required.</p>
<p>(d)	The certification requirement in paragraph (b) of this clause does not apply to:</p>
<p>(1)	Requests for routine contract payments; for example, requests for payment for accepted supplies and services, routine vouchers under a cost-reimbursement type contract, or progress payment invoices; or</p>
<p>(2)	Final adjustments under an incentive provision of the contract.</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1000 hrs PST, December 15, 2017.  Ship checks are scheduled for Wednesday, December 13, 2017.  Vendors participating in ship checks must RSVP to Beverly.j.parekr@noaa.gov no later than Tuesday, December 12, 2017.</p>

<DESC><p>1. Introduction and Purpose of the Request for Proposal (RFP)<br />1.1. Background on Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)<br />The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC or Commission) is an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government with regulatory oversight over the United States Postal Service (USPS or Postal Service). It is composed of five Commissioners supported by staff from its four operating offices, one of which is the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC). OAC is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters.</p>
<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Pub. L. 109-435, 120 Stat. 3250-51, suspended the Postal Service's contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) until after FY 2016. In June 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) revalued the FY 2016 CSRS unfunded liability at $26.9 billion and assessed the Postal Service an annual amortization payment of $1.7 billion due September 30, 2017, to liquidate the unfunded obligation by FY 2043. <br />1.2. Recent Developments on Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)<br />On November 13, 2017, the Postal Service filed a request under section 802(c) of the PAEA. The request is docketed at the Commission as PAEA Section 802(c) Request, Docket No. SS2018-1.</p>
<p>In its request, the Postal Service asks the Commission to examine the actuarial appropriateness and accuracy of OPM using government-wide demographic and salary-growth assumptions rather than those specific to Postal Service CSRS employees and annuitants. The Postal Service bases its request on OPM's more recent new rules revising 5 CFR Parts 831, 839, 841, 842 and 847. OPM's new rule amending 5 CFR 831 requires prospective use of postal-specific demographic assumptions and permits use of economic assumptions including salary growth. The Postal Service maintains that using postal-specific demographic and economic assumptions (such as salary growth) is actuarially appropriate and preferable in determining its portion of the CSRS obligations. It also observes that the propriety of full use of postal-specific demographic and economic assumptions has been recognized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Postal Service's OIG and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>The request does not specifically ask for a recalculation of the total CSRS liabilities, but only seeks a Commission finding upon review and comment on an actuary's report that: (1) it is appropriate and more accurate to use the postal-specific salary-growth and demographic assumptions than the assumptions used by OPM in calculating the CSRS supplemental liability and (2) that OPM should re-determine the supplemental liability using such assumptions.</p>
<p>2. Objective <br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy <br />of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's CSRS liability. <br />3. Tasks<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a final report, documentation, and deliverables in verbal, written and electronic format (as appropriate), and shall provide weekly written progress reports.<br />4. Disclaimer<br />Offerors are advised that the PRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFP; all costs associated with responding to this RFP will be incurred solely at the interested party's expense. <br />The PRC reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing PRC's understanding of the responder's proposal. The content of any responses to this RFP may be reflected in any subsequent solicitations.<br />5. Confidentiality<br />All information included in responses to this RFP is confidential and only for the use of the PRC. No information included in offeror proposals or in discussions connected to this RFP may be disclosed to any other party outside the PRC without the written consent of the offeror.<br />6. About the PRC<br />The PRC is an independent agency that is part of the executive branch of the Federal government. The PRC has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, with expanded responsibilities under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The PRC is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of six years. <br />Assisting the PRC is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The PRC is organized into four operating offices: <br />&bull; Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC)<br />&bull; Office of the General Counsel (OGC)<br />&bull; Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations (PAGR)<br />&bull; Office of the Secretary and Administration (OSA) <br />The PRC maintains an independent office for its Inspector General. <br />OAC (39 CFR 3002.12) is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the PRC in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for PRC review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, amendments to international postal treaties and conventions, among other issues. <br />The General Counsel (39 CFR 3002.13) directs and coordinates the functions of the OGC and is directly responsible for the counseling and advisory services set forth in 39 CFR 3000.735-102. In accordance with 3001.8 of the rules of practice, the General Counsel does not appear as an attorney in hearings in any proceeding before the PRC and takes no part in the preparation of evidence or argument presented in such hearings.<br />PAGR serves as the public face of the PRC. As such, it is the PRC's primary resource in support of public outreach and education, media relations, and relationships with Congress, the United States Postal Service, and other government agencies. PAGR provides information for consumers and responds to their inquiries; informal complaints regarding individual rate and service inquiries are referred to the Consumer Advocate of the Postal Service. Public Affairs and Government Relations staff also works closely with members of Congress and their staff.<br />OSA (39 CFR 3002.11) provides management and staff support to the PRC's operational offices (including the Office of Inspector General), the PRC's strategic plan, and various initiatives of the Executive Branch. OSA ensures that the PRC has the physical, financial, technological and human capital infrastructure needed to accomplish its mission. The effort led by OSA provides financial management, records management, administrative and organizational support, planning and human capital resources for the PRC.<br />The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was established in June, 2007, as required by an amendment to the Inspector General Act of 1978 included in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-435 sec. 605).<br />7. Scope<br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's CSRS liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.1. Project Details<br />The actuarial consultant shall:</p>
<p>&#61607; Review the existing assumptions employed by OPM to separately determine the effects on CSRS liabilities apportioned to the Postal Service.<br />&#61607; Review the demographic assumptions employed by OPM to separately determine CSRS liabilities pursuant to new rule 5 CFR Parts 831, 839, 841, 842 and 847.</p>
<p>&#61607; Review the economic assumptions that may be employed by OPM to separately determine CSRS liabilities pursuant to new rule 5 CFR Parts 831, 839, 841, 842 and 847.</p>
<p>&#61607; Review the appropriateness and accuracy of using demographic and economic assumptions specific to the Postal Service to separately determine CSRS liabilities pursuant to new rule 5 CFR Parts 831, 839, 841, 842 and 847 rather than government wide economic assumptions in addition to demographic assumptions specific to Postal Service CSRS employees and annuitants.</p>
<p>&#61607; As applicable, compare OPM's current and prospective assumptions to standard or typical sets of assumptions used by other semi-government, government bodies or private sector entities.</p>
<p>&#61607; Meet with OPM, USPS, and USPS OIG actuaries, as needed, to discuss the appropriateness and accuracy of methods and results.</p>
<p>&#61607; Support PRC staff members in identifying and assessing appropriate methods in selection of assumptions.</p>
<p>&#61607; Provide related supporting data and, to the extent practicable, models, or descriptions thereof to PRC staff.</p>
<p>&#61607; Address the effects and volatility of funding assumptions on the level of funding for a pension fund, risks of overfunding vs. underfunding, , and any other important issues.<br />7.2. Report Overview <br />Provide a final written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate demographic and economic assumptions, and an evaluation of the current and revised prospective assumptions used and to be used by OPM in its calculation of CSRS obligations. The evaluation will include:</p>
<p>1. A comparison of OPM's assumptions, where appropriate, to assumptions typically used for calculating pension liabilities;<br />2. Specific discussion of the effects of current and prospective assumptions on the Postal Service's CSRS obligations.<br />8. CSRS Liability Examination <br />The ultimate goal of this project is to have an actuarial consultant service to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's CSRS liability. <br />To achieve this goal, the PRC has outlined the requirements for the following areas: <br />8.1. American Academy of Actuaries <br />The actuarial consultant must be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries, have extensive experience in the pension field, and must have experience analyzing pension issues in a legal and legislative context. <br />8.2. Disclosure <br />The actuarial consultant must disclose all current and previous work performed for USPS or any other federal agency. The actuarial consultant also must disclose any pending negotiations for professional engagements with USPS or other federal agencies, apart from this SOW. <br />8.3. Qualifications<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a description of qualifications, proposed work methods, an estimate of the length of time needed to complete the project, the total cost of the project, and the basis for the calculation. <br />8.4. Timeline <br />The actuarial consultant shall acknowledge that if selected to provide professional services pursuant to this SOW, all work will be conducted with the understanding that time is of the essence in meeting the contractual deadline and that no extension of the deadline will be allowed. <br />9. Deliverables Guideline<br />This section is the deliverable guideline for this project. At this time, we anticipate a work plan to include all the items listed below. However, the vendor's work/task plan to implement the scope of work is at the discretion of the vendor and should be included as part of your capabilities. Acceptance of the proposed deliverables is subject to the approval of the Commission.<br />9.1. Date due: 90 days from Contract Execution <br />Provide a final written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate demographic and economic assumptions, and an evaluation of the current and revised prospective assumptions used and to be used by OPM in its calculation of CSRS obligations. The evaluation will include:<br />9.2.

<p>(b) Shall be available to assist the Commission in addressing comments on the consultants report prior to Contract Close Date (Estimated 1 September 2018).</p>
<p>(c) Dates are TBD<br />10. Assistance from the Commission<br />The Commission will provide the contractor with background documents and data, as well as make staff available to answer any questions the contractor may have while completing the deliverables.<br />11. Place of Performance <br />PRC's office at 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200W, Washington DC, 20268 and at place of business.<br />12. Quality Control<br />As a small-agency, the PRC has found that contractors can contribute significantly to the PRC and its mission success. Whenever the PRC awards a contract, it expects to receive top quality service. This section provides the crucial foundation for identifying, measuring and ensuring quality standards for consultative services.<br />The contractor will provide information, guidance, and support to the PRC for its Quality Assurance (QA) of the services provided under the contract. QA is a systematic and planned pattern of actions taken to ensure that necessary technical requirements are established, that the deliverables conform to these requirements, and that acceptable performance is achieved. Thus, the contractor will help the PRC to verify that the contractor's own Quality Control (QC) is sufficient and that their deliverables meet the agreed upon criteria. To plan and conduct QC, the contractor considers among other factors the generic criteria listed in the next paragraph.<br />A useful service for the government is delivered in a timely manner and thus the quality of performance exhibited by the contractor, will depend on their ability to deliver their services by established deadlines. The PRC expects accuracy of the services and deliverables rendered on time by the contractor. Procedures and communication between the contractor and the PRC concerning the contract shall be unmistakably clear to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities. The procedures and deliverables of the contractor shall be consistent and in compliance with this statement of work, and shall result in services rendered that effectively meet the PRC's needs. The contractor's work shall be done in an efficient manner, and their services under the contract shall meet the highest standards (e.g., user friendly, innovative, and provide the best value to the government).<br />With the signatures of the contractor and the Contracting Officer on a finalized contract and any associated task orders, the contractor certifies that it can meet the quality standards and criteria as cited within the agreed-upon cost framework. For substandard contractor performance under the contract where delays, cost overruns as well as deviations from the agreed upon acceptable quality levels occur, the contractor will perform rework of the deliverables at no additional cost to the Government. An example of a delay that deviates from an acceptable quality level would be where timelines and contract specifications are not implemented, requiring rework of deliverables and additional cost. If the PRC is responsible for the delays or cost overruns, the PRC will incur the additional cost.<br />13. PRC Rights<br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to amend this RFP, and/or to make no award or cancel this RFP. <br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this solicitation, to negotiate and award separately with competing respondents, and to accept that proposal which, in its judgment, is in the best interests of the PRC. This does not necessarily mean the lowest bid.<br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to make a full or partial award in response to this RFP.<br />&bull; At any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the PRC may amend this RFP by issuing addenda. Any addendum issued shall be part of this document and shall be communicated in writing to all who have obtained this RFP directly from the PRC. To give prospective contractors sufficient time in which to consider an addendum in preparing their bids, the PRC may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for the submission of offers.<br />&bull; The PRC reserves its right to rescind an offer at any time for any reason.<br />&bull; Pre-award Survey: The PRC reserves the right to perform a pre-award survey that may include, but is not limited to: (1) interviews with individuals to establish their ability to perform contract duties under the project conditions; (2) a review of the prime contractor's financial condition, business, and personnel procedures; and, site visits to the offeror's institution.<br />14.

<DESC>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br />"Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase B)"
<p>General Information<br /><br />Document Type: Synopsis for A-E Service Contracts<br /><br />Solicitation Number: W912DQ18R3000<br />Posted Date:</p>
<p>Original Response Date:</p>
<p>Current Response Date:</p>
<p>Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Service</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).</p>
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) Small Business firms sharing $12 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all Small Businesses. The period of performance for each contract will be five (5) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than April 2018.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a Small Business if its average annual gross receipts are $15 million or less. More than one contract may be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. The project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the Prime/Joint Venture (JV) firm. It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework. These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments will include Preliminary Assessments, site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in areas 1 through 3 below, clearly demonstrated in the past five (5) years. The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, development of UFP-QAPPs, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, installation of monitoring wells, groundwater modeling, and Remedial Design. Experience with differing contaminants in various media including soil, groundwater, sediment, and bedrock, should be demonstrated. Experience providing A-E services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated quality management processes and procedures that result in high quality work products. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate a strong understanding of quality management principles by describing quality management roles and responsibilities and organizational structure, and by documenting quality management process and procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>3. Managing cost reimbursable contracts. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate experience managing government cost reimbursable contracts as the prime including accounting systems, cost tracking, managing cost and schedule variances, cost/budget projections, and indirect rate adjustments. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, professional registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework, longevity with the firm, and experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Civil/Geotechnical Engineering; (4) Chemistry; (5) Environmental / Process Engineering; (6) Risk Assessment; and (7) Industrial Hygiene. A maximum of three (3) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of two (2) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E of the SF 330.</p>
<p><br />(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performance, the board will consider the relevancy of performance evaluations on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract.</p>
<p>(D) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF330.</p>
<p>(E) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (03/2013 edition) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 70 printed pages with Section H limited to ten (10) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 70 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.</p>

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.<br />(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.<br />-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes,<br />7<br />where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.<br />-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA].<br />-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA.<br />-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA].<br />-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD).<br />-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).<br />-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).<br />-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402.<br />-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules.<br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.<br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.<br />(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.<br />8<br />(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.<br />(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.<br />(f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.<br />(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.<br />(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and<br />(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.<br />II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.<br />(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.<br />(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.<br />(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.<br />(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.<br />9<br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions<br />(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity<br />The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.<br />V. Breach Response<br />(a) In general.<br />In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.<br />This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.<br />(b) Government Reporting Provisions<br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a<br />10<br />breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.<br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US-CERT office.<br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.<br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.<br />(c) Individual Notification Provisions<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.<br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected<br />11<br />individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:<br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.<br />-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.<br />Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.<br />If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.<br />The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.<br />Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.<br />VI. Termination<br />12<br />(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.<br />(b) Effect of Termination.<br />(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.<br />(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.<br />(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VII. Miscellaneous<br />(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.<br />(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.<br />TOBACCO FREE MEDICAL CAMPUS (TFMC)<br />In accordance with Army Regulation 600-63, paragraph 7-3, 14 April 2015; Operations Order 15-48 (Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Tobacco Free Living - USAMEDCOM), 8 May 2015; and any Operations Order, regulation or other instruction implementing, defining or otherwise addressing the Tobacco Free Medical Campus (TFMC) on any military installation or DoD-controlled location, Contractor personnel are prohibited from using any tobacco product on or within any TFMC while performing under this contract. TFMCs are established at each installation or DoD-controlled location and include: (1) any property or non-residential building that is operated, maintained or assigned to support medical activities, including but not limited to, hospitals, medical laboratories, outpatient clinics (including medical, dental, and veterinary facilities), or aid stations operating for the primary purpose of delivering medical care and services for DOD eligible beneficiaries and /or meeting the mission of the Army Medical Command; (2) all other facilities in which medical activities or administration take place, to include HQ MEDCOM and Defense Health Headquarters; (3) all internal roadways, sidewalks and parking lots; and (4) all sidewalks, parking lots and grounds external but adjacent to the building or related to the migratory corridors surrounding the medical facility. The Contractor shall obtain from the COR any orders, regulations, instructions or other documents implementing, defining or otherwise addressing the TFMC for any given installation or DoD-controlled location where Contractor personnel may perform under this contract and shall instruct Contractor personnel on the TFMC limitations for installations or DoD-controlled locations where they may perform under this contract.<br />13<br />Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs (October 2015)<br />1. The Contractor shall not employ or contract with any individual or entity (hereinafter collectively referred to as "person") to provide items or services that will be included in invoices submitted to the Government under this contract if such person is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) or the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List. The Government is legally prohibited from paying for provision of items or services by such persons.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. <br /><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />_X__52.204-7 -- System for Award Management (Oct 2016)<br />(a) Definitions.

Synopsis: 
COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name or Equal commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G-18-Q-0111 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.
Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase Dermatomes to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam and the Philippines. Cryotherapy Tissue Ablation Systems are used for Cryoablation, a process that uses extreme cold (cryo) to destroy or damage tissue (ablation).  Cryoablation is used in a variety of clinical applications using hollow needles (cryoprobes) through which cooled, thermally conductive, fluids are circulated. Cryoprobes are inserted into or placed adjacent to tissue which is determined to be diseased in such a way that ablation will provide correction yielding benefit to the patient.  When the probes are in place, the cryogenic freezing unit removes heat ("cools") from the tip of the probe and by extension from the surrounding tissues. Common applications of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung, liver, breast, kidney and prostate and for therapy intended to ablate particular tissues using catheterization procedures (e.g., cardiac).  Cryotherapy Tissue Ablation Systems (cardiac) are being procured to allow integration and compatibility with current Cryotherapy Tissue Ablation Systems in use.
A single award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name or Equal equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein.  Quotes shall contain the terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand Name or Equal equipment.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112   Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing and the associated size standard are 1000 employees.  This procurement action is for full and open competition.  
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Cryotherapy Tissue Ablation Systems as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  
The ordering period is one year with two 12 month option years.  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria as attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.

The mice provided by this vendor are produced as genetically unique strains that are required for continuity of research at NIOSH/HELD.
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received prior to the closure of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to Diane Meeder at DMeeder@cdc.gov by January 03, 2018 at 3:00 P.M. ET.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Combined Solicitation/Synopsis<br />Solicitation Number: HHSNCCOPC18-000011<br />Posted Date: November 29, 2017<br />Original Response Date: December 8, 2017<br />Revised Response Date: December 13,2017<br />Classification Code: 65-Medical, dental &amp; veterinary equipment &amp; supplies<br />Set Aside: No set-asides<br />NAICS Code: 541 -Professional, Technical and Technical Services/541990 -All other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services<br />Contracting Office Address<br />6707 Democracy Boulevard Suite 106 Bethesda, MD 20892<br />Description<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items," as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-96).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990, with a small business size standard of $15.0</p>
<p>The Clinical Center/Radiology &amp; Imaging Sciences has a requirement to develop and validate a cost effective, easy-to-use and fully integrated navigation system for needle placement during image guided cancer diagnosis and treatment. Applications include but are not limited to biopsy, various thermal ablations (e.g. radiofrequency, cryo-, microwave, and laser ablation), and brachytherapy.</p>
<p>Accurate diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention depends on accurate needle insertion, which may be extremely difficult in certain settings. In standard CT-guided needle placement procedures, translation from a pre-planned needle angle to the actual intra-procedural needle insertion is estimated only with the physician's visuospatial abilities and experience.</p>
<p>The goal of this contract is to improve needle placement in clinical practice. Image-guided needle insertion is a promising method for fulfilling the project goal, but the system must be cost-effective, accurate, and ergonomic to be clinically feasible. The proposed system's hardware includes a compact guidance platform that tracks needle-based interventional instruments, and provides navigation information to the clinician during the procedure. The system will be designed to assist with cancer treatment planning and procedure execution.</p>
<p>The technology will be a compact tracker design that can clip onto needles and provide Micro Electro Mechanical (MEM) inertial-based tracking. The hardware will also have fewer sterility requirements and it will be easier to calibrate compared to existing electromagnetic and optical tracking systems. The calibration step of the device only takes a few seconds, making it practically negligible. The wireless clip design allows the navigation device to be easily attached to and removed from any standard needles, which gives the physician the highly desired freedom to benefit from the navigation while minimizing its impact on the clinical workflow. Our device allows for visual guidance during procedures by providing real-time angulation tracking of needles, catheters, or interventional tools. Visual guidance will improve targeting accuracy, and reduce procedure time and side effects.</p>
<p>Outcome: The product of this contract is a fully integrated needle-guidance system prototype that is ready for human clinical trials. The system will be prototyped and evaluated in a live animal/human study to quantify the targeting accuracy and workflow for CT, Cone Beam CT, and Ultrasound-guided procedures.</p>
<p>Specifications:<br />A2. Engineering Specifications:</p>
<p>A2. Engineering Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Wireless needle tracker</p>
<p>The Government seeks prototypes of wireless needle trackers to address the challenges in needle placement procedures by accurately tracking the needle angular and positional information. The needle tracker design should be compact, wireless, and can be clipped onto any needle instrument (Fig. 1a-d). The system will provide 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) sensing at up to 40 Hz. The tracker should be configured to wirelessly stream data via Bluetooth. The system should be ready for calibration and validation.</p>
<p>Sensor Fusion<br />The Government requires a method to combine the use of a gyroscopic sensing and the gravity vector to enhance needle tracking accuracy.</p>
<p>A3. Specific Instrument Descriptions and Deliverables: The contract deliverables include the wireless tracker electronics, mechanical protection cases, calibration docking stations, tracker chargers, and software source code for streaming out the positional information from the tracker.</p>
<p>&bull; 3 prototype Micro Electro Mechanical (MEM) trackers for abdominal biopsy needles<br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for abdominal ablation catheters<br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for abdominal ultrasound probes<br />&bull; 3 prototype universal MEM tracking beacons for multiple-propose tracking <br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for Prototype MRI-guided prostate transperineal focal laser ablation <br />&bull; 3 needle holders integrated with MEM trackers and an MRI visible needle-guide for navigation and registration<br />&bull; 3 prototype 100mmX100mm MRI visible grid fiducial markers for prostate transperineal procedures<br />&bull; 3 prototype electromagnetic tracker needle clips for multiple-propose needle procedures<br />&bull; The tracker cases together with the tracker calibration docking station will be fabricated using 3D printing technology and are made deposable.</p>

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>

<p>&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that-</p>
<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>

In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on December 15, 2017.

52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Item (Oct 2014)
IAW FAR 13.106-1(a) (2) award will be made to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government.  Price will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures at FAR Subpart 13.1. It is anticipated that adequate price competition will exist; thus, the Government intends to evaluate prices by comparison among offerors.  Award will be made to the lowest price offeror that receives acceptable technical rating and is determined to be responsible.  An unacceptable rating in any factor or sub-factor will result in the overall technical proposal being rated unacceptable, and the proposal will therefore be ineligible for award.   
Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Evaluation Standards
Rating	Definition
A (Acceptable)
 All of the minimum acceptable criteria as defined in the technical factors are clearly met by the proposal.  The offerors proposal meets the technical capability requirements defined in the solicitation.
U (Unacceptable) 
Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are met by the proposal.  An unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies.  Proposal fails to meet specified minimum technical capability requirements defined in the Specifications and the solicitation.
The following evaluation factor(s) will be used to determine acceptability:  
a.	Technical: The offeror shall provide specifications showing that the products offered meet the equipment specifications and the installation method meets the specifications within the Statement of Work. The Installer shall be a Motorola Certified Technician
b.	Price: Offerors shall submit pricing and complete fill-ins for the CLIN(s) listed on the solicitation sheet including. Identify quantities, unit prices, extended prices, and exact description/make/model of material to be used. Comparison of proposed lump sum prices received in response to this solicitation (competition) is the preferred and intended price analysis technique. Other analysis techniques, if deemed necessary, may be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price, such as comparison of previously proposed prices or analysis of other than cost and pricing data. The Government may reject any price that is evaluated to be unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates or Government realism analysis, such that the price is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity of this requirement. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<p>The Grantee (Celsia S.A. E.S.P.) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the Energy Storage System Feasibility Study.</p>
<p>The Grantee, a major electric utility in Colombia, plans to expand its solar generation assets by developing 200 MW of installed solar capacity over the next two years.  The Grantee has launched the first of these projects, the 9.9 MW Yumbo solar photovoltaic power plant, near the city of Cali in Department of Valle de Cauca.</p>
<p>Since utility-scale solar power plants in Colombia could require the installation of supplemental technologies (such as battery energy storage systems) in order to meet the country's power sector regulations to ensure the stability and reliability of the country's power grid, the Feasibility Study will assess a test deployment of a U.S. battery energy storage system at the Yumbo solar plant.  In addition to the test deployment, the Feasibility Study will examine the regulatory and technical aspects of installing battery energy storage systems at solar power plants throughout Colombia.</p>
<p>The objective of the Energy Storage System Feasibility Study is to support the deployment of battery energy storage systems at solar power plants in Colombia.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $676,728 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA").</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:00 PM (local time in Medell&iacute;n, Colombia) on December 15, 2017</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<a href="mailto:josephine.helms@va.gov">Josephine Helms, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>36C79118R0001   Amendment 2
The purpose of this Amendment is to correct verbiage in the solicitation on page 8, correct a misstated dollar value on page 12, to list questions and answers regarding the solicitation, and to provide an explanation to the most frequently asked question of why this procurement has not been set aside.  
On page 8 the title is listed as Section B   Continuation of SF 1449 Blocks. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation therefore, does not require an SF 1149 and does not include an SF 1449. The title should read Section B only. Per this Amendment the title on page 8 will be known as Section B. 
On page 12, B.3 Guaranteed Minimum states,  In the event that the minimum is not ordered, by the expiration date of the contract, the Government will pay (upon request) the difference between the amount ordered and $1,000.  The dollar amount should read $5,000 dollars. The guaranteed minimum for each line item is $5,000. Per this Amendment the sentence shall read as follows: In the event that the minimum is not ordered by the expiration date of the contract, the Government will pay (upon request) the difference between the amount ordered and $5,000. 
Several questions have been received from interested parties regarding this solicitation. The questions that have been received as well as the answers given to those questions are listed below. 
Questions and Answers   36C79118R0001   Weight Scales 
1.
Q:     We are a certified SDVOSB and have the capability to fill this requirement. Does this mean it becomes an SDVOSB set aside? (See below)
A:    This procurement is full and open and will remain full and open. Market research has concluded that the types of weight scales we require are not end products manufactured by two or more domestic small businesses. Please feel free to submit a proposal. (See below)
2. 
Q: Would you consider a Small Business Set Aside?  We have supplied scales to you in the past and I know there are numerous small business[es] that can supply these scales both FSS and Open Market.
A:   This procurement is full and open and will remain full and open. Market research has concluded that the types of weight scales we require are not end products manufactured by two or more domestic small businesses. Please feel free to submit a proposal. (See below) 
3.
Q: Do you have any preferred brands or models? We distribute for NDC/Medplus and Medline. We have several brands and models available.
A: All products proposed must be TAA compliant. There is no brand preference.
4.
Q: I thought the Supreme Court decision was based on if an SDVOSB was capable of procuring them? The whole point of their decision was that big companies were squeezing out the small businesses like mine despite the VA guidelines. The ruling was to prevent this and help SDVOSBs, wasn't it?
A: Please see solicitation Amendment 2 on FedBizOpps for the answer to this question. (See below)

5.
Q:  If I am reading this correctly, which I hope I am, this is not a SDVOSB/VOSB set aside. It s just a small business set aside?  I actually hope it s just a SB set aside - is that correct?
A:  This procurement is full and open. (See below)
6. 
Q: Regarding the subject RFQ; in multiple places within the solicitation it mentions a due date of 11/17/2017 (which doesn t make sense since it wasn t even posted until yesterday (12/06/2017), but the FBO front page shows a due date of 12/06/2017 (which is yesterday and the same day it was posted), so I m just trying to confirm what the actual due date is, and if we can still submit a quote as a SDVOSB?
A: I need to do an Amendment to fix the due date in the solicitation. You said there are multiple places but I only found one where it says 11-17 (page 5 under number 14) so if you could tell me where the other places are I can use that for the Amendment. The FBO front page from what I am seeing lists the response date as January 8, 2018 both on the website and in the attached document. If you could point out where you see a different date that would be helpful as well. The response due date is January 8, 2018.Businesses concerns of any size are welcome to submit proposals. (An Amendment was posted to correct the response date stated in item 14)
7.
Q: What is the time it s due by, please? 
A: Proposals are due by 11:59pm MST. *(Please note that the date of January 8, 2018 was clarified in a previous question with this same interested party)
8.
Q:  In regard to the solicitation mentioned, did we miss the individual specifications for each of the units, ie - Clin #1 to Clin #8 - in this solicitation? Also, if all or any of these units have been bid in the past two (2) years, may we request the most recent purchase information, ie - unit price, fob point, delivery ARO, any special payment terms, etc? (Company Name) is a SMALL BUSINESS, in continuous business for over 50 years without the assistance of any special government consideration financially and not classified as 8a, women owned. Would you consider labeling this buy as a SMALL BUSINESS set aside - please?
A: Interested party answered the first part of the question in a separate communication. (Upon further review of the paperwork, we found the specifications on pages #10 and #11 of the 79 page solicitation) 
--Thank you for letting me know that you found the specifications for the CLINs in the solicitation attached to the FBO announcement. 
In the past the scales that have been purchased were purchased as open market one-time buys. Those were FOB destination, delivery within 10 days ARO, and payment through Tungsten.  We do not have previous history for the scales we are procuring now as described in 36C79118R0001 as this is a new procurement with new specifications. 
This solicitation is for a 5 year IDIQ contract. It is not a one-time buy. This solicitation is full and open and will not be reclassified as a small business set-aside. Please see solicitation Addendum 2 on FedBizOpps  for an explanation of why this procurement is full and open.  (See below)
9.
Q: Can you confirm that Solicitation 36C79118R0001 is an active solicitation? I m asking the questions because we became aware of the solicitation via one of our  bid services . When I look for the solicitation on FBO, I can t find it.

A: 36C79118R0001 is an active solicitation. Please use the link below to access the solicitation. 
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=cfabe078695a8ee2e08b85c315a3c91d&tab=core&_cview=0

The most frequently asked question regarding this solicitation (in various forms) is regarding why this procurement is not a small business set aside. Please see the information below regarding why this procurement has not been set aside. 

Regarding Socioeconomic Set-Asides

In a June 16, 2016 opinion, a unanimous Supreme Court held that small business contracting set-asides imposed by the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (the  2006 Act,  codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127) are mandatory, apply even when the VA has already met its annual small business contracting goals, and extend to Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) purchase orders. See Kingdomware Techs. v. United States, No. 14-916, 597 U.S. ___ (June 16, 2016).  38 U.S.C.  8127 (d) USE OF RESTRICTED COMPETITION states  contracting officer of the Department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. 
13 CFR 121.606 How does a small business concern qualify to provide manufactured products or other supply items under a small business set-aside, service disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone, WOSB, or EDWOSB, or 8(a) contract?
(a)General. In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside or source contract, HUBZone set-aside or sole source contract, WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole source contract, 8(a) set-aside or sole source contract, partial set-aside, or set aside of an order against a multiple award contract to provided manufactured products or other supply items, an offeror must either:

(1) Be the manufacturer or producer of the end item being procured (and the end item must be manufactured or produced in the United States); or 
(2) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section as a nonmanufacturer, a kit assembler or a supplier under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. 
(b)Nonmanufacturers. 
(1) A firm may qualify as a small business concern for a requirement to provide manufactured products or other supply items as a nonmanufacturer if it: 
(i) Does not exceed 500 employees; 
(ii) Is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied; 
(iii) Takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice; and 
(iv) Will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor or producer made in the United States, or obtains a waiver of such requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
Based on our Market Research, there are not two or more known SDVOSBs that can furnish the end product of two independent domestic small business manufactures.

<DESC>12/08/2017: The Interested Parties List has been updated for an additional 51 entries. The combined total including all previous (11/09/2017 through 12/07/2017)updates, brings the total lines to 2374.

12/07/2017: This is a reminder for all Lead Applicants that the deadline for Volume I and II submissions is 12/13/2017, 2:00pm ET. 
The FAA will accept Lead Applicant questions, concerns, and clarifications submitted via the FAA/UAS Program Portal through 12/15/2017 (extended from 12/5).  Questions will be responded to by 12/22/2017.

11/08/2017: The purpose of this revision is to provide Amendment #1 to SIR No. DTFAWA-18-R-00001. Redline and clean versions are attached. Changes to the SIR consist of including specific dates in paragraph 7 Milestone Schedules (Table 1) and clarifying information in paragraphs 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.

11/07/2017: The purpose of this revision is to make publicly available the first iteration (V1) of the UASIPP Interested Parties List. The list has been added as an attachment.

11/02/2017: On October 25, 2017 the President directed the establishment of the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP) to test further integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions (this includes U.S. Territories and holdings).

This new pilot program encourages State, local, and tribal governments, in partnership with UAS operators and other private sector stakeholders, to conduct advanced operations safely and with public support in affected communities.  The Department Of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is announcing in a Federal Register Notice establishment of the UAS Integration Pilot Program, and identifies this site (https://faaco.faa.gov) to obtain the specific instructions for requesting access to a designated portal for submitting an application (in form of a proposal) to be considered for participation in the program. 

The first formal step for considering participants is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR). The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request For Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request prospective applicants to submit specific information for evaluation.  Applicants must be State, local or tribal Governments to be considered for award. Government applicants may team with industry.
The specific instructions for requesting access to the application portal are contained in the attached SIR. Applicants are required to provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number with their request for portal access. This SIR (and any future changes) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (https://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (SIR Table 1) should be reviewed immediately. The schedule within the SIR will be updated with hard dates when the Federal Register Notice (FRN) is formally published. The FRN publish date is expected to be on or about November 8, 2017.

The FAAs common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating, and selecting Applicants is contained in the agencys Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate selection for the UASIPP Lead Participants will be at the discretion, and order, of the Secretary of Transportation.

Applicants who have been selected by the Secretary will enter, under Other Transaction Authority, into Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with the FAA.  Each MOA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective participant conducts the pilot program. A sample MOA is provided as an attachment.

The FAA anticipates awards of five or more MOAs resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR). The period of performance is anticipated to be for three (3) years.
The Government will not provide any funding for project performance.
Each applicant must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in the attached SIR. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the SIR.
To be considered for award, applicants must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and not listed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Prospective applicants are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.   It is the prospective applicants' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the respondents expense.

<p>Industry is advised that the final RFP, when posted, will supersede any draft information posted to date. The final RFP will represent the Government's requirement. All communications concerning this acquisition must be coordinated through the Procuring Contracting Officer. <br /><br />Please note the restriction on the use of liquid fuels as a solution has been lifted.</p>
<p>All documents, including a library of classified and unclassified related documents, will be made available to interested Prime Offerors. The Offerors' Library, Unclassified and Classified is established and will be updated on an as needed basis. The Unclassified bidder's library is available on the FBO website, as a sensitive/secure package. The Government intends to include all responses to the questions presented by the Industry in the Bidder's Library. Please note, these draft documents are not final, and the documents may change significantly because of industry feedback, as well as internal and external review and approval processes.</p>
<p>Unclassified Bidder's Library: Interested parties must follow the below process in order to gain access to the library.</p>
<p>Access to the Bidder's Library: Sensitive/secure documents may contain For Official Use Only (FOUO) and/or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI); therefore they are loaded to the FBO website as export controlled documents, which require export controlled and explicit access. Vendors can request explicit access, and be granted access to view controlled, unclassified documents with explicit access designation through the FBO website. Only authorized vendors may access export controlled documents in FBO. Export controlled access level requires the vendor's marketing partner information number (MPIN) be certified by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service's (DLIS) Joint Certification Program (JCP). FBO receives a daily feed of authorized vendors, which determines access based on a vendor's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code/MPIN. MPINs are selected/assigned when a vendor registers in the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Reference the FBO Vendor Guide and/or demonstration video entitled "Advanced Functionality: Search Agents, Watchlists and Export Controlled Documents" available on the FBO homepage for more information regarding access to export controlled documents. Additional information regarding application for the JCP certification is available at the DLA DLIS JCP homepage at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ Default.aspx. If you are not able to access the export controlled FBO document 24 or more hours after receipt of the JCP certification, contact the Federal Service Desk (FSD) at https://www.fsd.gov/fsd-gov/home.do or 866-606-8220, and ask for assistance with your JCP certification in your SAM account. This should allow you to view export controlled documents posted to the FBO website. Disclosure, copying, dissemination, distribution, and destruction of the material shall be in accordance with the FBO Terms and Conditions individuals must agree to prior to viewing the attachments. Offerors will be notified of the availability or of any updates to the Library.</p>
<p>Classified Bidder's Library: Interested parties must follow the below process in order to gain access to the library.</p>
<p>In order to obtain any classified information interest parties must submit the Classified Information request in an email to T-4SubscaleTargetACQ@mda.mil. The subject line shall state "HQ0147-17-R-0015-Classified Library Access". Access to the Prime Offerors' Classified library will be restricted to Prime Offerors' personnel who have been cleared by MDA Contracting and Security Officials. Interested Offerors shall complete the T-4 Subscale Access Agreement Form included in this announcement. Classified information will only be distributed via the Classified Network (CNET) or in person at MDA. If information is delivered via CNET, Prime Offerors must include the CNET account to which the information will be delivered. If the Classified information is being picked up at MDA the person must be listed on the Information Request form and provide a photo ID at the time of pick up. Additionally, all information hand-carried must meet all applicable policies and regulations for the transport and safeguarding of classified information.</p>

<p><br />ARTICLE 2. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF WORK<br />a.	Introduction</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts the world's largest biomedical research program. Direct research and support activities are performed by approximately 18,500 employees in numerous laboratories, a 500-bed research hospital, and support facilities on NIH's main 340-acre campus, the 513-acre NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) in and at numerous off-campus leased installations located in Maryland.</p>
<p>The NIH is one of twelve agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services.  The NIH is comprised of twenty-eight different institutes and centers, all of which are funded separately by Congress.  All the institutes and centers work together under the Director of the NIH to pursue its mission of biomedical research.</p>
<p>The Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) is the unit at the NIH responsible for providing recycling, medical, and solid waste services.  The DEP is a division under the Office of Research Facilities (ORF). The ORF is under the Office of the Director, one of the 28 institutes and centers comprising the NIH.  The recycling and waste services described herein are critical services that support the NIH mission of biomedical research.  The DEP has a long history of providing high quality recycling and waste services to the NIH, which must be maintained and improved.<br />b.	Background</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the services required herein to the NIH installations identified in Attachment 1.  The NIH Bethesda campus and the NIHAC are the only properties fully owned and operated by the NIH under this contract.  The other installations are leased buildings occupied either by NIH researchers or NIH contractors providing direct research services.  Additional NIH facilities within the states of Maryland and Virginia and the District of Columbia, usually small or moderate sized waste generators, may be added during the term of the contract and shall be serviced by the Contractor upon the request of the Contracting Officer. Such requests shall be accomplished by either a directive from the Contracting Officer or by a modification to the contract. The Contracting Officer will determine whether a modification to the contract is required.</p>
<p>The NIH main campus has approximately forty buildings in which a wide variety of activities are performed including but not limited to: research, animal care, administration, in-patient hospital care, child day care, fire and police services, grounds maintenance, vehicle repair and maintenance, research libraries, and facility operation and maintenance.  The main campus is much like a small town with its own police and fire department, small residential area, facility and roads operation and maintenance groups, and a variety of other support operations that ensure services needed to carry out the mission of biomedical research are provided.</p>
<p>NIHAC is a 513-acre secure facility with sixteen permanent buildings and numerous temporary buildings where research work is performed.  The NIHAC has its own power plant and facility operation and maintenance staff.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,600tons of solid waste and MPW are generated annually by the NIH. The solid waste is comprised of institutional and on-campus residential wastes, animal bedding, construction debris, and a large quantity of recoverable material including wood pallets, construction debris, mixed paper, corrugated cardboard, consumer beverage containers and various plastics.</p>
<p>In 2016 the NIH recycled approximately 58% of the solid waste stream.  Primary recyclable materials currently collected include mixed paper, scrap metal, commingled materials (consumer beverage containers and related plastic, glass, aluminum and bi-metal cans), empty reagent bottles (plastics # 1 and 2), corrugated cardboard, polypropylene pipette tip racks (plastic #5), wooden pallets, tyveks, copier/printer toner cartridges, scrap metal and mixed construction debris. Approximately 3,000 tons of recyclable materials plus some 3,800 tons of mixed construction debris, are collected and recycled annually by the NIH. The NIH also initiated a pilot plastic file (soft plastics) collection and recycling program which, determining on market viability, it will seek to expand under this contract.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,050 tons of medical pathological waste (MPW) are collected and disposed of annually by the NIH.  MPW at the NIH is currently collected in MPW burn boxes which are made of cardboard and measure 46x46x36cm (1 8"x l8"x14").  The containers are purchased by the generators through the NIH Self-Service Stores.  All MPW waste is packaged by the generators and there is no sorting by type.  Sharps are packaged in puncture-resistant containers and then packaged into the burn boxes.  All burn boxes include two plastic bag liners that are tied closed before offering for collection and disposal. Some locations may require contractor provided carts for shipping oversized MPW (e.g. animal carcass) or, in case of the option to service the NIAID Fort Detrick facility, bagged MPW rather than boxed MPW.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all equipment necessary to perform the work described herein.  The Government is providing a very limited amount of equipment (See Government provided equipment attachment).  An operations center, on NIH's main campus, is provided for use by the Contractor.   Attachment for a layout of the buildings to be provided upon award), including shipping and receiving docks.  The building provides warehouse space for supplies and limited recyclable materials storage, a walk-in cold box for temporary refrigerated storage of MPW boxes, a walk-in cold box for the holding of MPW boxes determined to contain radioactive materials, a conveyor belt for in-house screening of MPW boxes, a radiation monitor mounted on the conveyor belt, plastics grinding equipment, baler, one loading dock scissor lift, one loading dock load leveler and office space.<br />c.

If signage is removed Contractor has 2 business days to replace signs. <br /> <br /> When requested by the Project Officer, additional or replacement interior and exterior containers, meeting the specifications in the container type specifications, shall be delivered and installed by the Contractor.<br /> <br /> The Contractor shall respond to service requests from customers for new containers, special collections or reporting missed collections.  Similar requests shall also be received from the Project Officer.  These requests shall be electronically tracked as specified in the "Recycling Service Request Log."  <br /> <br />The Contractor shall provide a driver and Front-End truck for daily animal bedding collection for composting or disposal on the main campus. Containers will be located at buildings 10C, 14A, 14D, 35, 49 and 35 to capture animal bedding. With ongoing campus construction, other facilities may be added. Several locations are designated as animal bedding waste generation points. These dumpsters will require specially designed tops to accommodate the unique animal bedding systems.  The weight per unit volume of this waste stream is greater than regular solid waste due to its variable water content. The Contractor shall consider this when planning for dumpster volumes and dumping frequencies. Contractor will additionally provide collection at building locations that dispose of animal bedding in bags through collection of bagged bedding with hampers or carts. Buildings 6B, 10A and 10B2, 29 and 14 complexes will be collection points.</p>
<p>Compost Contingency</p>
<p>The NIH and Montgomery County are continuing to locate a suitable compost facility. The Contractor will support compost which is anticipated to focus initially on kitchen prep waste. In this event, the contractor will be provided biodegradable liners and wheeled/covered &lsquo;toter' bins for the cafeterias at buildings 10, 35, 45, 12, 31, and 38. The toters will be brought down to the loading dock or a holding room in building 10 by cafeteria staff at specified times for collection by the contractor.  A tare weight will be established for the toters and each shall be weighed before dumping.</p>
<p>As compost outlets and compliance behavior by cafeteria patrons develop, Compost services will be considered for post-consumer cafeteria waste. That is, food waste within the cafeteria's employee/visitor eating areas will be disposed of by the employee in designated composting containers.  The contractor will collect the compost from each cafeteria and deliver to the loading docks for consolidation into the compost unit.  Compost from each building shall be weighed before dumping.</p>
<p>Compost waste shall be delivered to a Government approved composting facility when the truck is full. Weight tickets shall be included in the monthly reporting package and each building's composting weights will be provided monthly in the Recycling by Building report. Note that there is currently no composting facility approved to take food waste within the state of Maryland.  Food composting collection shall begin as soon as a facility is approved by the state of Maryland and the Project Officer.  <br /> <br /> Future compost expansion to include animal bedding is not prudent at this time due to market conditions, but will also be considered for future expansion under this contract.</p>

Monthly scores will be used to derive the annual scores.  Scores will be rounded to two decimal places.  Standard mathematical rounding procedures will be used when scores are not whole numbers.<br /> <br /> The total annual monetary value that will be used as the basis for annual monetary award or penalty shall be 3% of the total value of invoices paid per contract year.  The scoring ranges and corresponding monetary awards or penalties are specified below.			<br /> <br /> Range of Annual Score		% of Monetary Total as Award or Penalty <br /> 95 - 100		100% Award<br /> 85 - 94		75% Award<br /> 75 - 84		50% Award<br /> 65 - 74		25% Award<br /> 55 - 64		0% Award<br /> 45 - 54		25% Penalty<br /> 35 - 44		50% Penalty<br /> 0 - 34		100% Penalty<br /> <br />An additional bonus incentive could be awarded to the Contractor on the following basis:<br />1)	If the Contractor, on an annual basis, can identify a process or course of action that will save the Government funds within the contract budget, 10% of the amount saved will be awarded to the Contractor.<br />2)	Contractor must provide the Project Officer with a detailed written explanation and calculations demonstrating the method(s) and amounts saved. <br />3)	The Project Officer will evaluate the explanation and calculations and determine its validity and will have final say on its award. <br />4)	If no money is saved there will be no bonus. <br />5)	Example: The Contractor determines that if they utilize a compactor to consolidate the recycled materials generated on campus they could save the Government money off their budget by reducing the number of pulls made to disposal facilities.  <br />6)	If Contractor qualifies for additional bonus incentive award, it shall be invoiced along with the 3% incentive award or penalty.</p>

<DESC>This is an invitation for bid (IFB) solicited using the sealed bidding procedures of FAR Part 14.
<p>Bids are due by 10:00am Alaska Time on January 10,2018. A public bid opening will be held at that time. The address and call-in information will be posted in an amendment to this solicitation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment and supervision required for the construction described.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $36.5M.</p>
<p>A site visit will be held December 14, 2017 at 11:00 am (Date and Time subject to change), at the project site near Delta Junction, Alaska. Bidders are asked to RSVP the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm Alaska time on December 13, 2017, if they will be attending the site visit.</p>
<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Contracting Services Branch (CSB) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Remediation of the Delta-Clearwater project near Delta Junction, Alaska. The project site is located approximately 2 miles south of the Alaska Highway at Milepost 1408 which is approximately 14 miles east of Delta Junction.
<p>This job consists of re-grading the Delta-Clearwater project site to near pre-project (1998) conditions and stabilizing the disturbed area with woody debris and planting of live woody materials. The work involves placement of approximately 400,000 cubic yards of earthfill, 90 acres of topsoiling, 110 acres of woody debris placement and hydroseeding, 3000 cubic yards of riprap stabilization, and 55 acres of tree and shrub planting and live staking. Topsoil and woody debris materials must be located by the contractor and are not available on-site. The topsoiling material will provide an excellent medium and seed source for plants to re-inhabit the site. On the surface a random placement of "woody debris" will cover the entire project site. The purpose of the woody debris is to create microclimates conducive to plant growth and to help break up minor flow concentrations that may develop. GPS machine control will be required on the compaction equipment and any equipment involved in final grading and all topsoiling work.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $36.5M. The Product Service Code is Z2QA.</p>
<p>This project is being solicited as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) using the sealed bidding procedures of FAR Part 14. Mobilization to the site is anticipated to commence about March 15, 2018 or as soon as conditions allow. Actual project construction is anticipated to commence about May 1, 2018, with a required completion date of September 30, 2018. A pre-bid site showing will be held December 14, 2017 at 11:00 am (Date and Time subject to change), at the project site near Delta Junction, Alaska. Bidders are asked to RSVP the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm Alaska time on December 13, 2017, if they will be attending the site visit.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Total Small Business set-aside. The full solicitation package including specifications and drawings will be available from the Federal Business Opportunities website on or around December 7, 2017. A public bid opening will be held on or around January 10, 2018. Interested contractors must be registered in and must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov in order to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>For further information, contact Ryan Lorimer, Contracting Officer, via email at ryan.lorimer@wdc.usda.gov or via telephone at 907-761-7744.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY&nbsp;II<br /></span></strong><br />After considering various models and engaging with Congress and industry representatives on the best direction of the 3PK9-C effort, the TSA is investigating the use of a private industry, third party canine certifying organization(s), hereafter referred to as a TPCCO, to perform all 3PK9-C team testing and certification activities. It is expected that this model will best address the scope and scale of industry needs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Due to input from industry participants, the date for the 3rd Party Canine-Cargo Industry Day II has changed.<br /></span></strong><br />TSA will be hosting a second, unclassified Industry Day on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 31, 2018</span></strong> to present the framework and requirements of the 3PK9-C / TPCCO approach. Please find event details below:<br /><br /><strong>Please note the change to both date and location. TSA requests that all participants send new RSVP for the new date by the deadline. <br /><br />1. Event: 3PK9-C / TPCCO Industry Day II<br />2. Date: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 31, 2018</span><br />3. Time: 9:30 am - 12:30 pm ET<br />4.

<p><strong>1.</strong> Must be able obtain permission to receive, store, and protect Sensitive Security Information in accordance with TSA regulations and policies; <br /><strong>2.</strong> Must provide proof of a satisfactory completion of a Criminal History Records Check (CHRC) or equivalent for all 3PK9-C specific personnel;<br /><strong>3.</strong> Must have sufficient resources and personnel to conduct certifications;<br /><strong>4.</strong> Must have a minimum of five years of certification experience within one or more of the below organizations for each individual who will be conducting certification activities. The five years of experience must have been obtained within ten years of the date of the application:<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.</strong> United States Police Canine Association (USPCA), <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.</strong> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.</strong> North American Police Working Dog Association (NAPWDA), <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.</strong> International Police Working Dog Association (IPWDA),<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.</strong> Department of Defense (DoD), or US Government, <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.</strong> Similar organization that the TSA recognizes as qualified to certify a certifying authority. <br /><strong>5.</strong> Must designate a point of contact (POC) and at least one alternate.<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.</strong> The POC must be a senior employee or officer of the TPCCO and must be readily available during normal business hours.<br /><strong>6.</strong> Must be able to handle explosives; <br /><strong>7.</strong> Must be capable of certifying, in a consistent manner, 3PK9-C teams to TSA standards;<br /><strong>8.</strong> Must have capability to provide 3PK9-C certifications at cargo/shipping locations throughout the United States; <br /><strong>9.</strong> Must have the capability to be able create a calendar to reflect all scheduled certifications and make that calendar (and any revisions) available to 3PK9-C team vendors and the TSA designated authority with a minimum of a 60-day advance notice; <strong>10.</strong> Must have the capability to document, store, maintain and provide to the TSA designated authority, (upon completion of each 3PK9-C evaluation) all records pertaining to 3PK9-C certifications. These comprehensive written reports must detail the effectiveness and/or deficiencies of the canine teams being certified.<br /><strong>11.</strong> Must agree to provide TSA designated authority unfettered access to all certification/testing facilities, records, CETAs, CETA storage, and any other areas connected to 3PK9-C certification; <br /><strong>12.</strong> Must have sufficient knowledge of the processes for certifying explosives detection canines;<br /><strong>13.</strong> Must have the capability to review and assess performance on three levels: Handler, Canine and Team to ensure that all detection strategies are in accordance with the program requirements and to the appropriate training protocols; <br /><strong>14.</strong> Must have the capability to assess onsite conditions to create realistic scenarios; <br /><strong>15.</strong> Must have the capability to observe, evaluate and review the effectiveness of each canine team in the operational environment and develop a variety of scenarios to measure team performance.<br /><strong><br /><br />Application Submission and Selection</strong></p>
<p>Detailed instructions for applying for TPCCO will be provided during Industry Day II. A panel of experienced TSA canine subject matter experts will conduct the selection activities associated with the placement of an organization on the list of TSA-approved TPCCOs. Selection for the list will be pass / fail. Once the TPCCO(s) are selected, TSA personnel may visit the TPCCO's home location to assist with TPCCO stand up and the initial certification process, and to address questions related to 3PK9-C team certification implementation. Additionally, the CTC may host visits by newly selected TPCCOs to its Lackland Air Force Base location for similar discussions.</p>
<p>Once selected for TPCCO, an individual empowered to represent the company must sign a legally binding document with TSA which will describe in detail the specific responsibilities of, and actions to be taken by, both parties so that the goals of the third party certifier effort may be accomplished. The contents of this document will be summarized during this meeting. It should be understood by all companies applying for TPCCO designation that the company cannot also serve as a provider / vendor of 3PK9-C teams.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of TPCCO Operations</strong></p>
<p>The TPCCO will be responsible for all 3PK9-C team certification activities; TSA does not intend to directly certify any 3PK9-C teams. The TPCCO will be responsible for scheduling the testing dates and times; for coordinating all logistical concerns (e.g., ensuring necessary cargo configurations and cargo handling equipment are available); and for conducting the certification testing in an operational cargo environment. The TPCCO will maintain an electronic calendar of all testing events that is viewable by TSA. The TPCCO will ensure that each 3PK9-C team designated as "meeting TSA certification standards" does in fact meet the same standards as federal canine teams.</p>
<p>Requirements for serving as a TPCCO will be further discussed at Industry Day II. Requirements for the TPCCO to conduct of 3PK9-C team certification, contained in TSA's Third Party Canine Cargo Teams Certification Guidelines, contains Sensitive Security Information, and will be provided to TSA-approved TPCCOs that have completed the vetting activities below.</p>
<p><strong>Security Vetting<br /></strong><br />Concurrently with the application process, the potential TPCCO will also be subject to vetting required to receive and handle Sensitive Security Information (SSI). If it is determined that TPCCO personnel will require access to secured facilities in an operational setting, they will be required to undergo a Security Threat Assessment (STA).</p>
<p>Once the SSI senior corporate official and all other necessary personnel are successfully vetted, TSA will be able to electronically transmit password protected copies of documents.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>TPCCO operations will not be funded by the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Contingent on the outcome of Industry Day II, TSA anticipates opening the window for initial TPCCO applications in the first quarter of calendar year 2018. They will be accepted during a 30-day window and will take approximately 90 days to process. During this timeframe the company's application will be reviewed by the TSA selection board, and personnel and company vetting activities will occur.</p>

Original Date: 08/30/17
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA250-18-AP-0093

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, John D. Dingell, VA Medical Center, Station 553, Prosthetics (121), 4646 John R Street, Detroit, MI 48201.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  The estimated amount of this procurement is $32,000.00 which has been certified on Purchase Request No.: 553-18-1-635-0093 to purchase 4 Cases, Cypass Stents (MPN): 806574003.

 The Cypass Stents are used during scheduled surgical procedures.  This item will be  purchased from Alcon Laboratories, Inc., 6201 South Freeway, Fort Worth, Texas  76134-2001.
 The item is required to be delivered on or before December 12, 2017.
Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:    
 The stent creates a channel for liquids to flow out from theanterior chamber of the eye,  thereby reducing the intraocular pressure.
 The device rests in thesupraciliary spacebetween the sclera and the ciliary body. It s in  the shape of a cylinder that has an entry port on one end and a series of holes  throughout its body that diffuse the liquid flowing through. The size of the device and   the holes within it result in a set level of pressure below which nothing happens, but  beyond which the liquid begins to move through the device.
 The FDA has approved the CyPass Micro-Stent, a device for treatment ofmild to  moderate primary open-angle glaucoma that is intended tobe implanted along  withcataract surgery. The device will be marketed by Alcon, a division of Novartis.  Alcon acquired Transcend Medical, the original developer of this technology, in   February 2016.  This item is proprietary to Alcon, Laboratories, Inc.   
Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  Reviewed FPDS-NG, GSA, MedSurg Online Catalogs, NAC, for vendors with similar items without success. A google search was also conducted only to provide ineffective results.  There are currently no SDVOSB or VOSB organizations that are authorized to distribute this proprietary product.   



Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency,<br />Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), IT Services Division prepared this<br />justification for an exception to fair opportunity.<br />2. DHS FEMA OCPO for IT Services intends to limit the number of sources solicited pursuant<br />to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i) for the procurement of services to support the IMAST PMO and VSR<br />system for surge support in response to the 2017 catastrophic hurricanes. The proposed<br />contractor: Blueprint Consulting Services, LLC, GSA 8(a) STARS II - GS00Q17GWD2109,<br />POC: Tushar Garg, Managing Partner, 1330 Otis Place NW Unit 1; Washington DC 20010, 202-<br />390-8630 / tushargarg@blueprint-us.com.<br />3. Due to the multiple catastrophic disasters in August and September 2017, the Information<br />Technology Systems are being pushed to the maximum capacity. In addition, we are using<br />systems in ways not initially developed to be innovative to respond to the disaster survivors<br />in Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria. The Recovery Technology<br />Programs Division (RTPD) has the Virginia Systems Repository (VSR) which has several<br />disaster related applications and systems which have met load capacity. In addition, the<br />division's staff supporting the VSR is stretched beyond capacity and additional surge staffing<br />is required to support. Therefore disaster surge support is required to support the PMO and<br />VSR. The Contractor shall provide skilled personnel to support agile software development,<br />and operation and maintenance. This includes software application requirements analysis,<br />design, development, integration, testing, implementation, maintenance support, hosting, and<br />management of web-based applications, databases and technologies.<br />Performance Period Performance Period Dates Amount<br />Base Period 10/15/2017-04/14/2018 $ 1,454,932.00<br />Option Period 1 04/15/2018-10/14/2018 $ 1,204,392.00<br />Total Value Including All Options: $ 2,659,324.00<br />4.<br />____x_____FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A). The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent<br />that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.<br />_________FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B). Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or<br />services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are<br />Attachment D2<br />Justification for Exception to Fair Opportunity<br />Exceeding the SAT pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B)<br />JEFO &gt; SAT<br />JEFO No. XXX<br />unique or highly specialized. [The justification must demonstrate that the proposed contractor's<br />unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the exception cited].<br />_________FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). The order must be issue on a sole-source basis in the<br />interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued<br />under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for<br />the original order. [For logical follow-on, the rationale shall describe why the relationship<br />between the initial order and the follow-on is logical (e.g., in terms of scope, period of<br />performance, or value)]:<br />_________FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(D). It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum<br />guarantee.<br />_________FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E). For orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a<br />statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source.<br />Rationale:<br />Due to the unprecedented 2017 hurricanes, the program office requires surge support to be able<br />to respond effectively and efficiently. A directed award under GSA STARS II is recommended<br />to an 8(a) company that is familiar with FEMA and the requirements of the program office and<br />can effectively support the program within a quick time frame to mitigate the current situation.<br />5. The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed Task Order to Blueprint<br />Consulting for the disaster surge support is in the best interest of the Government and will result<br />in the lowest overall cost, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's<br />needs. The General Services Administration (GSA) has already negotiated fair and reasonable<br />pricing rates. Discounts to these GSA schedule rates will be requested. Additionally, prior to<br />issuance of the task order, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of<br />labor proposed to execute the specific task being performed in order to determine that the total<br />price is reasonable. The contractor's labor mix and level of effort will also be compared to the<br />Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The GSA STARS II rates are lower than the<br />DHS EAGLE II and FEMA EADIS BPA rates which is another cost savings to the government.<br />6. This is a disaster surge requirement and a long term support contract is not required or<br />expected to be required. The number of disasters that occurred back to back this season is<br />unprecedented so this type of contract would not generally be required.

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a single award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council of Chicago, IL to provide expert medical advice on poison control issues to VA medical staff located at various facilities throughout the state of Illinois.  These facilities, along with all their associated outpatient clinics, may include:

Jesse Brown VA Medical Center located in Chicago, IL
VA Illiana Health Care System located in Danville, IL
Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, IL
Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital located in Hines, IL 

This BPA will contain five (5) one-year ordering periods spanning from January 01, 2018 through December 31, 2022. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source.  The NAICS Code is 541990 with a size standard of $15 Million.  

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and services to the Contract Specialist within seven (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements. 

Information must be sent via email to Michael.sands3@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
