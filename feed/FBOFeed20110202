The event will also be webcasted live, at the website link provided below.<BR><BR>The event will also include thirty (30) minute one-on-one discussions between Government program personnel and interested industry parties, and will be scheduled on the day of the event on a first-come-first-served basis.<BR><BR>THIS IS AN ADVANCE ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY for planning purposes.  Additional information, including the agenda, directions and instructions for RSVP/reservations will be posted to the website link provided below.  <BR><BR>===============================================================<BR>Synopsis of Proposed Acquisition  <BR><BR>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires a dedicated agile and flexible advanced development and manufacturing capability for medical countermeasures that includes participation of both innovators and pharmaceutical firms. The Government requires an industry partner (prime contractor, consortium or other suitable business arrangement) to establish a DoD advanced development and manufacturing capability for medical countermeasures that will ensure the rapid development, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure, and cost-effective production of medical countermeasure vaccines and therapeutics. This may include small and large molecule products. The contractor will work with the Government in a partnership to manage, operate, and maintain the advanced development and manufacturing capability and to deliver medical countermeasure products throughout the life of the project, which is estimated at 25 years or more. The advanced development and manufacturing capability will leverage the development expertise of pharmaceutical firms that have licensed FDA products, while retaining the innovation of small biological technology firms and other independent innovators to support the needs of our military and the Nation.<BR><BR>The advanced development and manufacturing capability for medical countermeasures capability will incorporate production technologies in a flexible, multi-product (this may be up to eight (8) simultaneous products) manufacturing facility(ies) that can reduce medical countermeasures development and production cost and create the ability to produce medical countermeasures for development, and surge production.  The contractor will co-develop, with the Government, any overall product specific advanced development and manufacturing plan by leveraging expertise from the Government and non-Government entities associated with that specific product.<BR><BR>Recent and emerging technological advances in disposable manufacturing equipment, novel expression/production platforms and regulatory sciences will be used by the contactor to facilitate the implementation of a multi-product capability. The contractor will be expected to reduce the overall capital costs and time necessary to manufacture products and change manufacturing processes from one to another.<BR><BR>===============================================================<BR><BR>Industry Day information, including  directions, agenda, presentations, will be posted to the website link below as they become available:  <BR><BR>https://www3.natick.army.mil/mcmadm.html<BR><BR>Further, this link will serve as the Government's conduit to Industry for solicitation documents, documentation changes, program announcements, questions/answers, and other program information.

<DESC>Title: National Automotive Sampling System (NASS)
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is charged with the responsibility of reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Many sources of information are needed to permit researchers to adequately measure the characteristics of the highway safety environment. NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) operates a system of crash research teams that provide:</p>
<p>1. Detailed nationally representative statistics on motor vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>2. A database for evaluation of standards and for countermeasures design.</p>
<p>In 1977, the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) was begun with contract awards to ten Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) research teams and two quality control Zone Center. The system grew to a complement of 50 PSUs and four Zone Center in 1981.</p>
<p>In 1986, the program was reviewed by NHTSA and other organizations to assess its usefulness, efficiency, and statistical precision. It was determined that modifications were needed in case selection, data set definition, and PSU strata distribution. As a result, in 1988, NASS was divided into two systems: Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and General Estimates System (GES). CDS focused on the crashworthiness of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans involved in crashes and damaged enough to be towed. GES, on the other hand, collected limited data on other highway crashes in order to produce general estimates. From 1991 until 2010, CDS has included 24 PSUs located in 17 states with two quality control Zone Center. GES includes an additional 36 PSUs located in 9 additional states. All CDS and GES PSUs are currently established and functioning.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>Each PSU team collects certain information from traffic-police crash reports (PARs), which will be used to generate estimates of the nation's highway crash experience. Police reports that include passenger vehicles that are towed due to the severity of the damage and have a high potential for major injury will generally be selected for full investigation. The investigation of each case includes interviewing drivers and occupants, inspecting scenes and vehicles, reviewing official medical reports, and reconstructing crash dynamics. Crashworthiness information will be entered into electronic data files and subject to review by quality control contractors and NHTSA.</p>
<p>The contractor enters information from each investigation into an electronic file. Photographs are taken using digital cameras that allow the information to be readily entered into computers for storage and clinical review. After completion and quality review of all cases, NCSA prepares an annual analysis file for public use that includes case weighting factors. All personal identifiers are removed from electronic files to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. These NASS files, in conjunction with other data systems, provide the detailed and reliable information with which NHTSA and other motor vehicle research organizations can identify safety problems, monitor trends, assess proposed standards and countermeasures, and evaluate those already in effect.</p>
<p>Responsibility for operating the crash research teams, maintaining the quality of the field research data, and providing technical guidance for each PSU lies with the contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center. The Zone Center serves as the resource center providing the PSUs with expert technical guidance in crash investigation. The Zone Center closely monitors the performance of each PSU team in their zone as well as coordinating activities with the other zone center and NHTSA. They are a management link between NHTSA and the crash research teams assuming responsibility for field data collection, management, and quality assurance while NHTSA assumes overall, policy management. The Zone Center responsibility involves management of geographically distributed staff and requires experience in controlling field technical operations while interacting with NHTSA.</p>
<p>NHTSA plans to procure crash research, quality control, and technical guidance by contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center #2 for the Crashworthiness Data System and General Estimates System of NASS.</p>
<p>Contract Award: NHTSA anticipates issuing a Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee contract. The contract will result in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.</p>
<p>This solicitation is full and open competition.</p>
<p>Solicitation: The solicitation DTHN22-11-R-00431 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about March 1, 2011. All questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to reba.dyer@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than March 7, 2011. The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected on or about June 2011.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has operated the Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Policy Fellowships since 1973. It currently partners with more than 30 scientific and engineering societies to provide Congressional Fellowships, and nearly one dozen federal agencies to provide Executive Branch Fellowships. AAAS operates the Science &amp; Technology Policy Fellowships to enable accomplished scientists and engineers from early to senior career stages to learn about, participate in, and contribute to federal policy development, implementation, monitoring, enforcement and evaluation.</p>
<p>NIH has participated in the AAAS S&amp;T Policy Fellowships since 2001, providing a unique opportunity to introduce scientists and engineers to the analysis, development, and implementation of policies that affect the conduct of medical research. AAAS Fellows at NIH also have an opportunity to further develop their understanding of the processes and mechanisms that NIH uses to support, manage, and coordinate research, research training, and medical and health communications and outreach.</p>
<p>The AAAS S&amp;T Policy Fellowships support NIH by bringing highly trained individuals who contribute their doctoral level scientific and technical expertise, analytical skills, and external perspectives to federal policy. The Fellows accept placements in the science policy, planning, evaluation, programmatic, or legislative offices in the Institutes and Centers, and the Office of the Director, and work on initiatives of mutual interest to the Fellows and the host office. They interact with staff across the NIH, other federal agencies, scientific associations, voluntary health agencies, and other public and private sector organizations. Currently more than 25 former AAAS S&amp;T Policy Fellows hold senior positions at NIH.</p>
<p>The Fellows also participate in activities administered by AAAS, including an orientation on executive branch and congressional operations and a year-long professional development program on issues involving science, technology, and public policy. The fellowships are intended to be for one full year, and potentially renewable for a second year.</p>
<p>AAAS has a long history of cultivating high level scientists from academia, private industry, and non-governmental organizations to promote and recruit highly qualified fellowship candidates nationally. Additionally, AAAS plans and implements all provisions of its fellowship program, from application to placement, as well as recruiting, qualifying, and pairing finalist's interests and experiences to the needs of Institutes, Centers, and Offices for possible placement. AAAS provides a yearly professional development program with monthly meetings, seminars, and evaluations to enhance the fellow's experiences and career advancement as well as provide other policy and government related educational opportunities relating to biomedical research and public health. AAAS provides monthly administrative and management reporting and billing, and a yearly detailed report on the duties and activities of each fellow and the activities of their fellowship.</p>
<p>This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. AAAS is the only responsible source to provide the AAAS Science &amp; Technology Policy Fellowships and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency requirements. The Director, NIH, has the authority to conduct and support research training, including science research policy training (42 U.S.C. 282).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet the requirements as described above. Capability statements and related materials received by the Contract Specialist no later than March 21, 2011, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time will be considered by the government. Written responses received after March 21, 2011, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time will not be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Basic Requirement which addresses Phase 1 efforts includes Program Management/System Engineering; Ocean System Subsystem (OSS) Engineering; Shore Interface Production Engineering; Shore Electronics Subsystem (SES) Production Engineering; OSS Production Representative Engineering Performance Verification Testing; Fabrication Assembly and Testing of Production Representative SES; Trunk Cable Production and Testing; Internode Cable Procurement and Testing; Trunk and Internode Cable Terminations; Production of OSS Production Hardware; Provisioned Item Ordering and Data.
  Options are anticipated to address remaining Phase 1 efforts including Procurement of Hardware; Fabrication, Assembly and Testing of Hardware, Installation of the System; Training and Corrective Maintenance/Logistics Support.  Phase 2 efforts, are anticipated to be acquired as options to the contract and will follow a sequence of action similar to phase 1, from Program Management/Systems Engineering, Hardware Procurement, Fabrication through  Assembly and Testing; Installation, Training and Corrective Maintenance/Logistic Support.

The Undersea Warfare Training Range and corresponding data will be acquired on a Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee basis.  Offerors must be DoD contractors listed under the Joint Certification Program in order to receive the drawings and specifications.
  All requests must be submitted to the attention of Mr. William Hurley, Code 11912 via email at william.hurley@navy.mil.  Performance under the contract will be at the unclassified level.

<SUBJECT>99--FY11 Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Military Specific HIV/AIDS Prevention, Care, and Treatment Program
<SOLNBR>DHAPPBAA11002
<CONTACT>Latrice Rubenstein 619-532-4357
<DESC>The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support.  These collaborations improve our ability to better understand HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  To effectively focus on this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP).

DHAPP has successfully partnered with 83 countries to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services.
  DHAPP is a U. S. Government (USG) organization within the Dept of Defense, collaborating with the US State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  Working closely with other US Department of Defense elements, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening other capabilities to combat HIV.  
  

The new Partnership Framework within PEPFAR is a 5-year HIV/AIDS national strategy which will work in concert with and support the host countrys national HIV/AIDS strategy.
  The Partnership Framework will delineate USGs and host countrys roles and contributions to achieving stated goals and objectives. It is important for offerors receiving an award who work in countries with a Partnership Framework to connect with the military Partnership Framework point of contact.  Offerors receiving an award should be aware of the militarys PEPFAR activities and work in concert with these activities without duplicating efforts, creating parallel systems, or conflicting activities.  

Countries covered by this BAA include: Angola, Botswana, Caribbean Regional, Central America Regional, Cote d' Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, Ukraine, Vietnam and Zambia.
 For each country where funding is available, Attachment 1 will contain a description of the work that is needed, along with the program areas and an approximation of the available funding. It should be noted that while dollar amounts are listed this should be taken as an estimate of the funding for an effort whether a single amount or range is listed. Changes to this information will be provided in the form of amendments to this announcement.

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The SBA has been providing assistance to Americans to start, build, and grow businesses for nearly 60 years. The SBA is the one government agency with direct responsibility for assisting the nation's 29 million small businesses. The current SBA.gov Web site serves millions of users each year.</p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, the SBA has taken strides to improve its overall approach to online media, strengthen its ability to provide enhanced information services, and to build a personalized and dynamic Web site. As such, SBA is currently improving its primary SBA.gov Web site to broaden the scope of online services it provides, and to make it more user-centric and focused on the needs of the small business and lender communities. The new site merges key elements of current SBA online media resources, in particular the SBA.gov and Business.gov Web sites.</p>
<p>The SBA requires a wide range of technical support, including strong strategic planning/thought leadership, technology management, product and content strategy, architecture and development, and operations and maintenance support for this new, dynamic SBA.gov Web site.</p>

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision "... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ..." The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions.
<p>The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities of C2, sensor and weapon systems. These systems are deployed on a variety of platforms and users, both manned and unmanned, operating under challenging battlefield conditions (lack of infrastructure, mobility, spectrum, interference, multipath, atmospherics, size/weight/power constraint, etc.) in different environments (space, terrestrial and undersea).</p>
<p>The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 312) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity and quality-of-service for mission-critical information exchange among such widely dispersed naval, joint and coalition forces. The vision is to provide high throughput robust communications and networking to ensure all warfighters - from the operational command to the tactical edge - have access to information, knowledge, and decision-making necessary to perform their assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Objective and Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>Proposals for potential FY12 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects are sought under the following focus areas:</p>
<p>1. Novel approaches for wideband, electrically small, lightweight phased array apertures;</p>
<p>2. Alternatives to traditional SATCOM and network architectures for on-demand reach back, including low probability of detect/intercept wideband HF communications;</p>
<p>3. Technologies that enable low probability of detect/intercept for tactical data links against advanced electronic threats; enhanced synchronization of noise-like signals;</p>
<p>4. Spectrum co-existence (underlay/overlay, interference cancellation, etc.) of military waveforms (RADAR and communications) with commercial communications; RF/based transmit and receive technologies for dynamic (and simultaneous) spectrum access to multiple non-contiguous narrowband channels across a wide frequency band (e.g., 100 MHz - 10GHz); machine learning and reasoning based algorithms/protocols for distributed spectral awareness and spectrum/network management;</p>
<p>5. High wall-plug efficient, power scaled (coherent and/or incoherent), blue-green transmitter technologies. High speed (Gbps), single-photon counting, blue-green detectors. High performance blue-green receiver waveforms/protocols with relaxed sync/timing accuracies;</p>
<p>6. Robust tools/approaches for de-confliction of traffic prioritization policies - according to Commander's Intent - over a distributed, tactical network; and</p>
<p>7. Dynamic routing mechanisms that focus on robust data delivery - in near real time - under harsh networking conditions (i.e., intermittent connectivity, limited throughput, etc.).</p>
<p>ONR is also receptive to highly innovative ideas in other general communications and networking areas that is not designated focus as above, but nonetheless important to Navy/Marine Corps, as determined under the synopsis section above.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.   (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information on non-developmental Active Electronically Steered Array (AESA) Technology to Support Army Air Defense Systems. Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sources Sought Notice for Active Electronically Steered Array (AESA) Technology to Support Army Air Defense Systems.  This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  AMRDEC is interested in receiving information on AESA technology already developed or in development that could be utilized as to design and develop the primary aperture for Army Air Defense Radar Systems and that will be available for demonstration testing within the next twelve (12) months.  The objective of this process is to assess current and working prototype products within the US defense electronics industrial base, particularly as they relate to a notional medium range air defense radar system specification that has been developed by the AMRDEC.  Within an Army air defense system, AESA technology is viewed as an enabling technology for developing medium range air defense radar systems capable of detecting, tracking, and identifying cruise missiles (CM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and fixed wing (FW) and rotary wing (RW) aircraft, along with rockets, artillery, and mortar (RAM).  Consequently, AESA technologies capable of supporting high-power densities and wide instantaneous bandwidths are of interest. Given a successful demonstration, production of approximately 100 to 200 systems are anticipated.  Complete information on the radar system requirements can be found in the AMRDEC specification which is classified and can be obtained as noted below.  As a condition of responding to this RFI, it is a requirement that all potential responders possess the means to properly store and work on information classified at the SECRET level.  Only US based and owned companies are eligible to respond.  Foreign participation is not authorized, US citizens only.  Interested responders must request the AMRDEC Medium Range Air Defense Radar System Specification in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. Initial RFI responses are to be received within 14 calendar days of the date of this notice.  Initial responses  should be submitted to the contracts POC: Lisa Duncan at lisa.d.duncan@us.army.mil, US Army Contracting Command - Redstone, CCAM-RD-RB, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898 (PLEASE NOTE: NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE,  ALL CLASSIFIED INFORMATION MUST BE MARKED ACCORDINLGLY AND SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE POINT OF CONTACT IDENTIFIED FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THIS NOTICE). Initial requests must include: company name, Company and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, classified mailing address, and appropriate point of contact information.  After validation by the AMRDEC Security Office of each interested responder's security accreditation and eligibility to receive the AMRDEC Medium Range Air Defense Radar System Specification, a complete copy along with the appropriate security classification guide (SCG) will be mailed to each validated responder.  Responses to this RFI must be received within 45 calendar days of the mailing date of the classified AMRDEC specification.  Responses to this RFI should only include candidate AESA technologies that have been successfully demonstrated in a similar application or those that are in a lab-prototype stage.  The response should include a white paper of no more than 10 pages or a Power Point presentation of no more than 20 charts describing the AESA technology, how it supports the AMRDEC specification, performance results-to-date, and where applicable, points of contact for Government sponsors.  Responders are encouraged to provide explanations for those areas in which their product attributes differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the AMRDEC specification, as well as to provide commentary on the reasonableness of the AMRDEC specification.  Based on the responses, the AMRDEC, solely at its discretion, may request unfunded, follow on, face-to-face briefings.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward unclassified responses to US Army AMRDEC, RDMR-WG-R, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000, ATTN: Mr. Scot Holder or the following e-mail address: scot.holder@us.army.mil.

<p>Title of Project: <br />Behavioral and Serologic Surveillance of Long Distance Truck Drivers and their Assistants in Angola</p>
<p>1 Background and Need</p>
<p>Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. CDC collaborates with U.S. government PEPFAR partners, host governments, Ministries of Health, non-governmental organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC:<br />Builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; and assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data. <br />Develops tools, guidelines, recommendations, and policies to translate research for improved planning and program implementation. <br />Evaluates and implements novel approaches for conducting surveillance and surveys.</p>
<p>Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that BSS to be conducted with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Luanda, long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces, and young women involved in transactional sex in the border region of Cunene. <br />This request for contract is to conduct a BSS among long distance truck drivers in Luanda and Cunene.<br />Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV.</p>
<p>2 Project Objectives</p>
<p>To assist the Government of Angola in understanding the HIV epidemic among long distance truck drivers, CDC will support a behavioral and serological surveillance (BSS) baseline survey for the targeted population.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are:</p>
<p>1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among truck drivers;<br />2) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence among truck drivers; and <br />3) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys among most at risk populations for HIV.</p>
<p>This information collected will be used by program managers and planners to develop and improve HIV prevention and care programs for the target population.<br /><br />3 Scope of Work</p>
<p>BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Protocol Development,</p>
<p>&bull; Develop a comprehensive, cross-cutting protocol that includes behavioral and serologic data collection among long distance truck drivers and their assistants in Luanda and Cunene. <br />&bull; Obtain required Institutional Review Board approvals or exemptions.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Survey Implementation,</p>
<p>&bull; Recruit long distance truck drivers and their assistants to participate in the survey.<br />&bull; Conduct in-depth interviews with eligible survey participants.<br />&bull; Provide HIV counseling and testing services.<br />&bull; Collect and test syphilis and HIV specimen.<br />&bull; Provide clinical services and referrals for participants with positive test results and participants with complaints of STIs.<br />&bull; Follow-up with participants that have reactive tests results.<br />&bull; Pay participant allowances.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Data Management and Analysis</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze both quantitative and quality data collected.<br />&bull; Summarize analyses.</p>
<p>Phase 4: Dissemination of Results</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare a final written report of the survey.<br />&bull; Disseminate information, in writing and orally, to interested stakeholders.</p>

<DESC>Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS): Controller Development for Upper Limb Movement
<p>Notice Number: Sources Sought NIH-NICHD-NCMRR-SBSS-2011-15</p>
<p>Announcement Type: Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS)</p>
<p>Agency/Office: National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>Location: Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</p>
<p>Key Dates:<br />Release Date:<br />Response Date: 10 days after issuance</p>
<p>Purpose of this Announcement: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background and Project Requirements: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) anticipates continuing the project "Controller Development for Upper Limb Movement." We are looking for capability statements from Small Businesses to determine if there are Small Businesses capable of meeting the NICHD's follow-on requirements for a FES motor control system.</p>
<p>The contract goal continues to be the development of a prototype controller that is designed for future use as an external Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) control system for the restoration of function of one or more movements in the paralyzed upper limbs. The ongoing development of the controller includes a design that incorporates simulation technology for testing and a real-time external FES system that is interfaced with brain signals that are recorded from the motor cortical area of the participant. The extension of the project will enable the highly unique and experienced team of investigators to recruit and test additional participants and acquire and analyze patient data that will ultimately enhance the controller, making it a more powerful tool for translating cortical signals that would eventually drive the FES system for upper limb movement. The additional data will aid in the refinement of the controller and the testing/training technologies necessary for future devices supporting a variety of paralysis. Any new participants for this contract will be implanted with the BrianGate 2 Neural Interface System. To date this study has enabled significant advances in the implementation of the BrainGate implant technology for human participants, the sophisticated software development and computer driven testing of the implant, and the collection and analyses of human cortical signal data pertinent to the eventual control of upper limb motor movement. This research has involved a well established team of investigators who bring unique medical, bioengineering and technological experience, specialized resources and novel approaches that have been essential for the forward progress of the project.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance is 30 months from the time of award.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information: The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the following criteria. 1) Approach-Does the Offeror have the conceptual framework, design methods, analyses, and clinical protocols and assessment in place in order to continue to develop, integrate, and achieve the aims of the project including the engineering capacity to develop appropriate algorithms, design, and test the proposed controller that will interface with cortical implant signals and a FES motor control system? Does the Offeror have the capacity to identify an appropriate patient population to work with an experienced surgical team for implantation of the BrainGate 2 Neural Interface System and to provide the appropriate health care personnel? 2) Personnel and Experience-Does the Offeror have in place a research team that will be involved in the design, development, testing and evaluation of a FES controller that uses cortical signals for human motor control of movement? This must be supported by a track record in designing, developing and testing control systems for physiological functions, device construction, materials and interface issues, translation of engineered devices to clinical applications, and organizational experience in leading a multidisciplinary team of investigators. Does the team include engineers, scientists, and clinicians proficient in the development and testing of controllers, movement deficit, medical rehabilitation expertise that would guide the design of a control system and choice of target upper limb muscle(s), implementation and assessment of the controller and its interface with the human subject, needs of persons with spinal cord injury and upper limb paralysis, clinical research protocols and human safety issues, and previous experience in developing technologies to obtain cortical signals, process signals and input signals to activate limb movement.</p>

"Best practices" i.e., those business processes determined to be most effective in the business community, were identified for the administrative areas at the NIH. Implementation will require configuration or changes to the new system that will adopt and integrate these best practices. Functional teams under the direction of a functional team manager have been established to oversee this effort. Functional teams will engage in a variety of duties including the design and configuration of the system, establishing workflow for the business processes, customization of the system (only if required and approved by the Steering Committee), defining system interfaces, and participation in pre-deployment and deployment activities.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.<br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure professional consultant support services for the NIH Extramural Title 42 Committee (ETFC) requirements on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: NIH OER Consultation Support Services <br />Background<br />The NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) has been tasked with continuing to provide expert consultant services in support of the NIH Extramural Title 42 Committee (ETFC). The NIH ETFC is an NIH executive committee established to implement policies for extramural/policy staff on Title 42 (T42) appointments. This work will consist of reviewing complex scientific material in order to provide executive consultation and advice at regular meetings of the committee regarding the establishment of new T42 positions; Conversion of existing staff from T5 appointments to T42; analysis of information provided by NIH Institutes/Centers in relation to established criteria; and strategy recommendations for consideration by the NIH ETFC committee.<br />SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED
<p>The ETFC requires expertise and consultation from a source with current working knowledge of the responsibilities of senior extramural scientific positions and the history and intent of using the Title 42 and Title 5 mechanisms. Of paramount importance is a historical knowledge of the variety of positions that could possibly be included under Title 42, the various organizational structures used by the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), or similar agency, to perform functions included as "extramural" for the purposes of this activity. Additionally, the factors that should be considered by that agencyas critical for determining the appropriate use of the Title 42 appointment for non-intramural scientists.</p>
<p>The vendor must develop an extensive historical background and current working knowledge of a broad range of issues related to Title 42 versus Title 5 appointment mechanisms as they relate to specific positions within the NIH extramural staff, or similar agency. For example, an extensive understanding of the scientific missions and complexities of NIH ICs and the different extramural organizational structures relevant to the multiple categories in the NIH Extramural Professional Designation Model should be conveyed. The vendor must be able to analyze proposed scientific positions and prepare a justification for consideration by the ETFC in relation to established criteria as well as decisions on previous positions for consistency and fairness. <br />In addition, these projects must be started quickly in accordance with the NIH timeframes, to ensure that related position establishment and conversions are handled efficiently and without undue delay, as this could affect recruitment of senior-level scientific staff into extramural positions. <br />RESOURCES<br />Government will reimburse Contractor for travel expenses of the instructor based on the established government per diem for Bethesda, MD. <br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />12 months from the date of award with two (2) additional 12-month option periods.<br />Other Considerations:<br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION : This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

OVERVIEW: 

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a requirement to implement Real Time Location Systems (RTLS) in all VHA facilities over the next several years.  As currently envisioned, each VHA Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) or facility will have its own RTLS database, similar to the situation with Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  However, there is a need to aggregate some data from the individual RTLS systems, so that VA/VHA leadership can have an enterprise-wide view of RTLS data.  The RTLS Integrated Project Team (IPT), lead under the VHA Major Initiative 15 known as Health Care Efficiency (HCE), requests the provision of a Middleware system, allowing key stakeholders to collect and analyze data, and generate reports from VA/VHA wide RTLS.  This Middleware system will have the ability to integrate information from multiple front-end RTLS databases; provide analytical and reporting capabilities for aggregated RTLS information; and possibly interface to VistA, Maximo, and other VA corporate information systems.

BACKGROUND: 

The RTLS Middleware (data aggregation) requirement is managed under an overall RTLS  effort within VHA Major Initiative 15 - Health Care Efficiency: Facility Automation.  This initiative is charged with incorporating the existing VHA RTLS platforms into a national plan that will ultimately deploy RTLS, and its chosen middleware application VA-wide.  The existing RTLS platforms currently support locating and tracking equipment/supplies, clinical staff, patients, and patient/staff movement.  This type of information helps to improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery to our Veterans by improving workflow, and many other clinical/management processes.  These RTLS platforms use an array of technologies to include:wireless LAN, wired Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) with Infrared, and Ultrasound.  Future plans for expansion include developing requirements, standards and overseeing broader RTLS deployment.  As RTLS expands, the need for facility, VISN and National level reporting will greatly increase.  VA does not presently offer ongoing regional/national reporting support via a Middleware application tool.  

Active RTLS platforms are located in Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) St. Louis, Minneapolis, Loma Linda, San Juan and Houston.  These projects started over the past few years for either inventory or more niche applications, and were "grandfathered" into the official VHA Major Initiative 15 - Health Care Efficiency: Facility Automation Program.  Four applications were determined to be a starting point for current RTLS efforts which includes: Asset Management, Inventory Management, Automated Temperature Monitoring, and Sterilization Processing and Decontamination (SPD) Workflow.  Ultimately, as RTLS is deployed VA-wide, a myriad of applications and work functions will be added to the platform including the need for data aggregation within RTLS Middleware servers.

The VA is looking for sources capable of providing an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS) Middleware (i.e. data aggregation). The VA understands the breadth and depth of the desired RTLS Middleware solution and is looking to determine the ability of industry to provide a total integrated solution.
  
VHA is comprised of 21 VISNs that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities.  Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1. VA medical centers within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 153 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

VHA seeks an integrated RTLS Middleware (data aggregator) to be deployed nationwide.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals for data aggregation are to interface with the regional RTLS databases to help:

o	Improve operational efficiency
o	Decrease operational costs 
o	Maximize equipment utilization
o	Increase clinical efficiencies and staff productivity
o	Reduce delays in patient care
o	Minimize lost and misplaced items
o Improve the quality of service from patient, physician, and institution perspectives
o Provide national-level reporting and information sharing through an enterprise   database with a common interface and reporting tool.
For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment within one or more VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software and all necessary hardware (servers).

 
REQUIREMENTS:

1.	RFI Requirements Summary - the VA understands that very few large healthcare delivery organizations have deployed RTLS Middleware (data aggregation) in the scope or on the scale that the VA requires.  The VA goal is to provide a feasible solution for aggregating all RTLS data from disparate tags/technologies/vendors at a given site. The optimal solution would use validated data interchange standards for aggregating data from multiple sites into a single corporate database. The requirement includes the use of application programming interfaces in terms of data interchange between RTLS systems and external systems (such as Maximo).  Individual vendors are required to provide solutions for  aggregating data  to a highest level specified.  The VA objective is to obtain facility-level data aggregation (one-stop shopping), to VA headquarters-level data aggregation for overall national reporting.


2.	Develop and implement an RTLS middleware database and reporting capability.  Capable of capturing data.  Upstream data from a given facility must consolidate into a single database, and be accessible via a single user interface.

3.	Describe your approach to achieve an efficient data aggregation solution. Data aggregation will support analysis of the data, high-level reporting (including ad hoc report and query capability), and dashboarding. Include a description of how your approach incorporates ways to boost performance. 

4.	Describe your approach to provide an enterprise-class business intelligence [BI] solution that shares industry standard characteristics. Include a description of how your approach ensures high availability, easy maintenance, allows for multi-server environments, adopts to changing business environments, and integrates with existing applications and systems.

5.	Describe your approach to Flexible architecture that allows for exponential growth, flexibility, and responsiveness to the shifting needs of the VA customers who must operate in an business environment that is always changing. 

6.	Describe your approach to Performance as it refers to the speed, responsiveness, and quality of the application. The VA environment demands current information with fresh data in "Google-like" response times in order to make judicious business decisions. Explain how your approach does not require users to trade excessive build times for query performance. Also describe how performance is not dependent on the number of concurrent users, data, query complexity, or time-of-day variations. 

7.	The amount of data being collected is increasing and is expected to grow exponentially as RTLS technologies are proliferated and this initiative is executed VA-wide. Describe how your approach includes a flexible architecture that fosters scalability. 

8.	Describe how your approach ensures a fast implementation time; include a clear explanation of the implementation methodology. In describing the Graphical User Interface [GUI] include descriptions of any wizards that speed development, offer help to users, or minimize training.

9.	Describe your approach to creating all required interfaces, from end-to-end, in accordance with industry standards, to communicate with the VA's legacy information systems. 

a.	Examples of the type of interface issues to be considered:
i.	Programming M code (i.e. MUMPS - Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), to add/modify within the VistA application, allowing for the exchange of data between the facility level RTLS platforms and VistA.  
ii.	Use of a government provided VistA test environment 
iii.	Ability to capture interface details through the creation of a formal RTLS Middleware Interface Control Document (ICD). 

Potential Future Phases:

10.	 Ability to incorporate a data minining product in addition to the BI product.
a.	Examples of the type of interface issues to be considered:
i.	The predictive analytics product shall provide a simple interface with which to build data sets for modeling
ii.	The predictive analytics product shall be able to save mining "Sets" (data plus formulas run) as individual files.
iii.	The predictive analytics product shall be able to auto schedule or auto run a pre defined set of inquiries on a recurring 
iv.	The predictive analytics system shall have its own processing/computing platform.  
v.	No aspect of running the predictive analytics system will in any way impact the BI app or any other aspect of the aggregated data.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to SureWorks, LLC, 618 Teal Circle, Suite 1B, Longmont, CO 80501. This ongoing research and development requirement is for software/electrical engineering support to fully develop a computerized panel display with touch panel interface for the Tracy Fish Collection Facility Count Station.  Fish species and numbers that are sub-sampled during count station procedures will be entered into a computer database using a computerized panel display with a touch panel interface that will be designed to Tracy Fish Collection Management and Operator specifications. This computerized interface would replace the use of paper record keeping and time spent entering the data into a computer later.  Images of seasonally entrained fishes that one could touch on the screen and enter quantity and provide notes if necessary would streamline the data collection process and provide greater accuracy with less human-related error.  Fish entrainment data will be gathered into Microsoft Excel and PDF documents for reporting and data management along with flow, operational, and facility-related information.  The output will also include automated daily graphs of entrainment and may include some statistical analyses with standard reports.  A fish species classification engine will be implemented to the count station in this third year phase of the contractor and Government research and development efforts.  The end goal of the project is to enable automatic identification and morphometric data of collected fish.  Proprieatry software that is being developed for the SmeltCam fish identification device by SureWorks, LLC. in conjunction with Bureau of Reclamation scientists, will be used for count station fish recognition.  Fish at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility are the same as those encountered during the SmeltCam project on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  Awarding to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of research efforts because another contractor would not have the project-specific knowledge (covers a 4 year period of accumulated research effots), time investment, and inter-governmental agency research networking.   Ongoing information and data has been accumulated from both laboratory and field testing of fish identification software and algorithms which cannot be duplicated.   A final consideration is that the current research and development firm has proprietary rights to their developed software.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $7 Million.  Any response shall be submitted no later than February 17, 2011, 4:00p.m. MST.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation for this ongoing research and development project.

NAWC TSD intends on negotiating and awarding multiple spare and repair buys on a sole source basis from 6 March 2011 through 7 March 2012.
  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $12,500,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor, as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302, the proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and only negotiate with Attachment (A) sources.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (A) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.   Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than fifteen (15) days from the posting date.

A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>&nbsp; The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CA, Inc., 2291 Wood Oak Dr., Herndon, VA, 20171, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." SSA will be purchasing seven months of extended maintenance for CA Identity Manager Version 8.1 software products.
<p>Interested parties that feel they can provide the required licenses and maintenance support may respond by submitting their capability statement via email to Rick.Bolt@ssa.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All information concerning this notice shall be submitted by February 7, 2011 at 12:00 pm, ET. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intent to pay for information received. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations. All questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the email address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Justification for Extended Identity Manager 8.1 Support<br /><br />The Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO) has a need to continue Computer Associate (CA) support on Identity Manager (IDM) version 8.1. This will be an extension over a seven (7) month period to afford SSA time to upgrade and migrate to the new release version of IDM 12.5. The current IDM 8.1 configuration consists of CA applications (CA IM, SiteMinder, JBOSS, Apache, Admin, eTrust Directory and Unicenter) with load balanced and router services in production (UNIX hardware managed by DIIAS). In addition, the same-hosted environments are within the NETF Data Center at DISSAO for testing and development purposes.</p>
<p>Authority 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Only the manufacturer, CA can provide the software maintenance needed for the outdated version of CA Identity Manager 8.1. CA has no resellers of software maintenance for this outdated version 8.1 of CA Identity Manager.<br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />Some benefits to SSA from the IDM 8.1 extended maintenance service are:<br /><br />1. Currently there are four separate production environments for IDM at SSA: SSPR (Self Service Password Reset), TEC (Triennial Certification), UNIX De-Provisioning (CA Admin), and Automated User Management (AUM), installed on UNIX and Windows hardware. The extension will allow SSA to continue IDM 8.1 infrastructure support on the existing hardware. <br /><br />2. The extension will allow SSA to continue support of IDM 8.1 while building the new IDM 12.5 environment. This will include testing patches, configuration changes, and refining functionality scenarios on 8.1 to ensure ongoing performance of support SSPR (Self Service Password Reset), TEC (Triennial Certification), UNIX De-Provisioning (CA Admin), and Automated User Management (AUM).</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>SECTION I. Description <BR>Section I. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct Basic Research as described below and in the Supplemental Package currently available via email request only to Ms. Velvet S. Taylor, Agreement Administrator (velvet.taylor@us.army.mil), Mr. Kenneth E. Helms, Alternate POC (ken.helms@us.army.mil) and/or Ms. Linda Diedrich, Grants/Agreements Officer (linda.diedrich@us.army.mil). Upon each request, supplemental package will be uploaded to AMRDEC Safe Access File Exchange (SAFE site) for access.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this announcement, as supplemented. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and the aforementioned Supplemental Package constitute the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding this requirement. <BR><BR>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals for a cooperative agreement from U.S. higher education institutes to conduct basic research focused on barrier issues relevant to progress in vertical lift technology for ongoing and future force needs.  This research is best conducted in a concentrated interdisciplinary center, or Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence (VLRCOE).  Since future force combat vehicles will be deployed to remote regions of the world and based on Naval vessels at sea, a variety of proposals should focus on research to enable major cost reductions in advanced vertical lift configurations suitable for these conditions.  This VLRCOE Program is funded by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is managed by the National Rotorcraft Technology Center (NRTC) located at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA.  It is intended to support the long-term basic research objectives of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and NASA,  to establish a significant dual-use technology base from which the military aviation community and the rotorcraft industry can draw substantial knowledge and capability, and to provide a source of trained rotorcraft research professionals qualified to work on DoD programs.  The VLRCOE constitutes the next stage of the U.S. Army's continuing support of a Rotorcraft Centers of Excellence Program initiated in 1982.  This announcement covers the VLRCOE program for five (5) program years, initiating in the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2011 through 2015.  The Government plans to award up to three VLRCOEs.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: To be selected, proposing U.S. higher education institution must offer a range of faculty capabilities and appropriate vertical lift-related course work in a number of disciplines to establish a 'Center.'  A Center may be composed of a lead university and partner universities collaborating to provide the scope of program necessary to address the widest range of technical fields.  In addition, the inclusion of tasks performed collaboratively with individual investigators from other universities in order to enhance the Center's program content is encouraged.<BR><BR>VLRCOE proposals submitted under this BAA should include research tasks in at least four of the following fields:  (1) Aeromechanics, (2) Structures, (3) Flight Dynamics and Control, (4) Rotor Design and Concepts, (5) Vibration and Noise Control, (6) Propulsion, (7) Affordability, and (8) Safety and Survivability. In addition, each proposal should include at least one task addressing the field of Naval Operations.  Tasks in additional fields not listed may be proposed provided they directly address the objectives of the BAA.<BR><BR>Research tasks should be focused on basic scientific issues that are of unique importance to vertical lift and that have the potential for making significant contributions towards U.S. Army and Navy research thrusts and DOD and NASA goals and missions.  Interdisciplinary research efforts should be emphasized, but should be focused on fundamental physical phenomena and understandings.  Technology transfer and the partnering of this research endeavor with the U.S. rotorcraft industry, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, NASA, other Government organizations (e.g., FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.  The use of graduate fellowships at enhanced stipend levels and/or plans for an internship program to be mentored at Government labs are also encouraged as a means of attracting the highest caliber (U.S. citizen) students to the VLRCOE program.<BR><BR>DELIVERABLES:  A VLRCOE shall present an annual program review supported by presentation materials that will document the progress and research accomplished during each program year. At the end of the 5-year program, a final program report is required for the total 5-year program.  The final report shall include the VLRCOE's overall accomplishments, research paper publications, degree recipients along with subsequent career paths, patents filed, and technical accomplishments of each task.  The VLRCOE shall submit Federal Financial Reports (SF 425) on a quarterly basis and a final within 90 days after the Agreement expiration date.  <BR><BR>SECTION II:  Award Information<BR>ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The anticipated total Government funding for the program is approximately $4,000,000 per year over the five-year program duration. However, the total proposed budget for each proposal shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.    It is intended that a Center will be a competitive environment, both within each individual Center and between the Centers, in which the annual program review will provide opportunities for evaluating progress on technical tasks and making changes to the program as needed.  Although a five-year program with specific tasks will be negotiated for each Center prior to award, the Government reserves the right, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement governing modifications and additional research, to add new tasks or make changes to existing tasks as additional Government funding becomes available and/or funding is redirected from tasks that are not productive.<BR><BR>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  The Government anticipates an award of a Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358, as the Government desires to be substantially involved in the performance of the VLRCOE Program.  Offerors must provide at least half of the costs of the program to the maximum extent practicable.  This is a matter of DoD policy.  The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipients have a vested interest in the program's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf. This announcement will remain open until 4:00 p.m. EST Thursday, March 31, 2011.  Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by June 1, 2011.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through September 30, 2011. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received.  Any award, partial or full, is conditioned upon being evaluated as meritorious as a VLRCOE as described in Section V below. <BR><BR>SECTION III. Eligibility Information: <BR>Participation is limited to U.S. institutions of higher education. Further, all work or research performed under the cooperative agreement(s) resulting from this announcement must be performed within the United States. Proposals including work or research that will be performed outside of the United States, in whole or in part, are not acceptable and will not be given further consideration for award. <BR><BR>SECTION IV. Application and Submission Information: <BR>Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the detailed instructions and formats in the Supplemental Package available upon request via email request only to Ms. Velvet S. Taylor, Agreements Administrator (velvet.taylor@us.army.mil), Mr. Kenneth E. Helms, Alternate POC (ken.helms@us.army.mil) and/or Ms. Linda Diedrich, Grants/Agreements Officer (linda.diedrich@us.army.mil).<BR><BR>GENERAL:  Offerors must submit a proposal for a 5-year research program developed based on research fields discussed in Technical Description Section with examples in Appendix D in this BAA.  The proposal should include the following three sections:  Management Section, Budget Section and Technical Section. Offerors should submit an original and three (3) hard copies of the entire proposal and 2 CDs.  Each CD shall contain all three sections requested with the technical and management in PDF Format and the budget section in Microsoft Office (Excel) format. Hard copies of proposals should be submitted on plain, white letter-size paper only, utilizing one side of the page with no foldout pages.  This precludes the use of cardboard stock, plastic covers, colored paper, and binders such as three-ring, spiral and plastic strips. The Management and Budget Sections (Sections B.1 and B.2) are limited to a total of 20 pages inclusive of both sections.  The Technical section (Section B.3) is restricted to 70 pages.  Page limitations are inclusive of any drawings, charts, etc., and exclusive of section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices (which are not considered content pages).  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages specified.  Pages shall be standard 8   x 11 inch paper and main body type shall be not less than a 10-pitch minimum font size, not less than single spacing (a maximum of 6 lines per inch) with margins at least 1 inch.

Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of any agreement will not be binding. Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this announcement which is necessary in submitting offers or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror(s) will be published as an amendment to this announcement. Proposals will not be accepted via FAX or electronic mail. Only materials within page limitations will be evaluated. Proposals must be received by the time and date stated above. For purposes of this announcement, late proposals will be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. A copy of any cited reference/clause is available via link http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. Late proposals will not be reviewed or returned. <BR><BR>SECTION V. Application Review Information:<BR>EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD: The selection of one or more sources (i.e., centers or VLRCOEs) for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth below and in the Supplemental Package. The proposals will first be evaluated as an integrated, balanced center and then the 5-year program technical tasks will be subjected to a scientific peer review by a team of knowledgeable scientists/engineers. The tasks will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under thi s announcement. These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals and technical programs submitted under this announcement. Proposed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness, concurrently with the scientific peer review. Note that it is possible for a proposal to be excluded from the competition if it is deemed to lack the established merits to be a VLRCOE based upon the following criteria. These criteria are equally weighted as part of the overall assessment of the viability of the offeror to become a VLRCOE: (1) Cost sharing and university support as stated in this announcement; (2) Vertical lift technology courses offered to graduate students within the Center or easily available through electronic, remote access; (3) Critical mass of technical expertise within the Center; (4) Access to experimental facilities and equipment; (5) Balance of technical tasks; (6) Partner universities and individual investigators from other universities to strengthen the Center's program; (7) Participation of Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) (Goal of 5%); (8) Prestigious Fellowships at enhanced stipend levels and other programs for attracting the highest caliber (U.S. citizen) graduate students into the VLRCOE program; and (9) Plans for an internship program for (U.S. citizen) graduate students to be mentored at Government labs.  The evaluation criteria applicable to the technical tasks in the proposals will be applied to determine which of the proposed tasks will be funded in any VLRCOE agreement(s). The technical tasks will be evaluated using the following criteria: (1) Scientific merits and quality of the technical approaches of the proposed research tasks; (2) Uniqueness/relevance of the proposed task to the competitive position of the U.S. rotorcraft industry and advancement of U.S. military vertical lift technologies.  Proposed tasks should be clearly distinguished from other Government-funded efforts conducted by the university; (3) Qualifications and past contributions of the principal investigators and other key research personnel in the proposed research area; (4) Quality of the technology transfer plan including partnering with the industry, military and federal aviation communities; and (5) Reasonableness and consistency of proposed budget for accomplishing the proposed research.  Criteria (1), (2) and (3) are equal and substantially more important than (4) which is more important than (5).  <BR><BR>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: All work performed under resulting agreement(s) will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material. The preponderance of research performed is anticipated to be basic or fundamental research exempt from export controls. However, it is possible that one or more project tasks may require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U. S. C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470. Prior to award, the successful offeror may be required to provide an 'Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement' certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25 if any proposed task is determined to be subject to export controls. This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Ctr., Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572. Participation in this program is limited, regardless of tier, to U. S. entities. <BR><BR>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: No Government Furnished Property is anticipated under any agreement resulting from this announcement. If Government Furnished Property is necessary, it shall be detailed in the proposal. <BR><BR>SECTION VI. Award Adminstration Information:<BR>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to any response preparation cost.  The previously referred to Supplemental Package provides detailed instructions critical to proper preparation and submission of a proposal.<BR><BR>SECTION VII. Agency Contacts:<BR>Offerors desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request in writing via email to the attention of Ms. Velvet S. Taylor (Agreements Administrator), Mr. Kenneth E. Helms (Alternate POC) and/or Ms. Linda Diedrich (Grants/Agreements Officer) at velvet.taylor@us.army.mil, ken.helms@us.army.mil and/or linda.diedrich@us.army.mil.

Indirect calorimetry is used for analysis of metabolic rate in mice, which is one of the major functions of the Mouse Metabolism Core.  NIDDK has been using the Oxymax System for 14 years.  The current system allows testing of only 8 mice at a time.  To meet the increasing demands of the NIDDK investigators, we need to increase our capacity up to 20 mice per test.  A new system must be compatible with the old system, since both systems will be operated simultaneously.  Because of the very compact design (12 cages placed inside 51 X 31 X 80 chamber) this is the only system that will fit into the space available for this equipment.

<CONTACT>Todd R Davis, Contracting Officer, Phone 6516027932, Fax 6516027914 , Email todd.davis@mn.usda.gov
<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Multiple blanket purchase agreements (BPA) as defined at FAR 13.303 are planned as a result of this solicitation for abstract, title and closing services for various conservation easement programs in various counties within the state of Minnesota. A blanket purchase agreement (BPA) is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. BPA's are not binding contracts, but rather agreements that set forth pricing and other terms and conditions. BPA's can be cancelled at any time by either party and vendors are not required to accept orders under a BPA. However, individual calls/orders issued against a BPA are legally binding once performance begins or the vendor accepts the order in writing.
<p><br />(ii) Solicitation Number AG-6322-S-11-0001 - This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ), and the simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 13 are being utilized.</p>
<p><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49, effective January 24, 2011.</p>
<p><br />(iv) This is a 100% small business set aside and the applicable NAICS code 541191 -- Title Abstract and Settlement Offices, which has a size standard of $7 million (annual revenue). Only quotes from small businesses will be considered. A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. Size standards are the average annual receipts of a firm. How to calculate average annual receipts of a firm can be found in 13 CFR &sect; 121.104. For more information on these size standards, please visit http://www.sba.gov/size.</p>
<p><br />(v) BPA Line Item Numbers. Pricing must be held for 30 calendar days after the due date for quotes listed in this notice to provide for adequate time to evaluate quotes and make award. All costs for services provided must be allocated to one of the contract line items below. Although not recommend, firms may substitute or add additional line item(s) for related costs that are not able to be attributed to one of the following line items. These substitutions and/or additions will be used to evaluate the total price for purposes of evaluating the quotes and for issuing calls/orders under any resultant BPA. Any costs for clearing exceptions to the title will be proposed to the Contracting Officer and agreed upon between the parties through modification to an individual BPA call prior to rendering the services. Separate reimbursement for any other costs will not be made. The quoted price schedule will be used to evaluate each offeror's price and to establish the rates to be used for any resultant BPA calls.</p>
<p>Item Description Qty Unit Unit Price<br />001 Abstract Update - Title/Records Search (per abstract) <br />1 EA $ ____________<br /><br />002 Title Exam (base fee, including first abstract) <br />1 EA $ ____________<br /><br />003 Title Exam (additional fee for each additional abstract examined) <br />1 EA $ ____________<br /><br />004 Title Insurance Commitment (per easement) 1 EA $ ____________<br /><br />005 Title Insurance Premium (per easement, rounded up) <br />1 $1,000 value $ ____________<br /><br />006 Closing Services (per easement) <br />1 EA $ ____________<br /><br />007 Recording Fee (per document) <br />1 EA $ ____________</p>
<p>If rates for line item 005 vary based on dollar value, list the per $1,000 premium amount for each applicable dollar range with the quote.</p>
<p><br />(vi) Description of Requirements. Abstract, title and closing services for various conservation easement projects located in multiple geographies/counties as grouped below. See the Statement of Work for more detail on the services required which apply to all contract line items. Historical estimates of the total number of easements projects for each group are listed for the last three years. However, the quantities listed after the county names are for information only and do not necessarily reflect the quantity of easement projects that may arise in the future. No minimum or maximum number orders are guaranteed under any resultant BPA's. Geographies were grouped in an effort to balance workload among the several BPA's without establishing too many or too few BPA's. Additional easements projects have been conducted in other counties throughout the state but in much lower volume. Requirements for those counties not listed below that are in excess of the micro purchase threshold will be competed among at least three vendors, which may include existing BPA holders for the counties listed below. For those requirements under the micro purchase threshold a BPA call may be issued to one of the BPA holders for a county not listed below using the pricing established in the agreement if both parties agree to do so. Vendors may quote on multiple geographic areas, but only one vendor can hold a BPA for one geographic area. If vendors chose to bid on multiple geographic areas they must list their order of preference for award should they be the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeor for more than one area. Any tie quotes will be resolved using the procedures at FAR Part 14.</p>
<p>Area 1 Becker and Mahnomen (31)<br />Area 2 McLeod (19)<br />Area 3 Jackson, Sibley, Waseca, and Meeker (15)<br />Area 4 Pope and Stevens (34)<br />Area 5 Clay, Wilkin, and Otter Tail (35)<br />Area 6 Kandiyohi (40)<br />(FOR KANDIYOHI, TWO BPA's WITH TWO SEPARATE VENDORS WILL BE ISSUED DUE TO HIGHER ANTICIPATED VOLUME. REASONABLE ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO FAIRLY DISTRIBUTE ANY RESULTANT BPA CALLS BETWEEN THE TWO VENDORS.)<br />Area 7 Freeborn, Mower, and Steele (25)<br />Area 8 Douglas and Grant (18)<br />Area 9 Big Stone and Swift (15)<br />Area 10 Norman (25)<br />Area 11 Marshall, Polk and Pennington (15)<br />Area 12 Rice, Le Sueur and Scott (1)<br />(DESPITE THE HISTORICALLY LOW NUMBER OF EASEMENTS A HIGHER VOLUME IS ANTICIPATED IN THE FUTURE)</p>
<p><br />(vii) Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and Acceptance. The period of performance will vary for each project under each BPA call. See the Statement of Work for specific timeframes for project deliverables. Delivery and acceptance will be made by the Contracting Officer at the NRCS MN State Office. It is imperative that performance be executed in a prompt manner so as to ensure timely closing of the conservation easement.</p>
<p><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The following addenda also apply. Offerors must read and follow the following additional instructions:<br />In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. Successful offers will also be required to provide a completed NRCS Conservation Cooperator Certification, a completed Standard Form 1199a (Direct Deposit) to facilitate electronic transfer of funds for all payments, and provide evidence of at least $1 million in liability insurance coverage (certificate of insurance) for errors and omissions or provide an indemnification agreement from the title insurance for which the contractor will close the transaction or transactions prior to award of a BPA. Only one copy of the quote is required to be submitted. Offeors can be submitted by mail, fax or email (scanned documents). If the document is faxed it is recommended that the offeror call or send an email the contracting officer to confirm receipt.</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items does not apply to this solicitation. Instead, the following evaluation procedures will be used as permitted by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1). The lowest priced, technically acceptable quote will be selected for award of a BPA for each geographic area. For Kandiyohi County (Area 6) the two lowest priced, technically acceptable quotes for Kandiyohi County will be selected for award of a BPA.</p>
<p>Under this procedure quotes are first evaluated for technical acceptability and receive a pass or fail rating. They will not be ranked based on technical acceptability. In order to be considered for price evaluation and possible award, proposals must address all technical acceptability requirements listed below. Next, quotes that pass all technical requirements will be ranked by price within each geographic area by summing the value of all quoted line items in the price list referred to in section (v) of this notice. To ensure that the effect of the insurance rate(s) in line item 005 is adequately evaluated, a sample easement value of $200,000 will be used to determine the total amount for this line for evaluation purposes only, while the rest of the line items will be evaluated using a quantity of one (1).</p>
<p>Requirements for Technical Acceptability.<br />First, quotes will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis to ensure that they meet the following technical acceptability factors.</p>
<p>Prior Experience with Abstracting, Title Search, Title Examination, Easement Closings, Title Commitments and Title Insurance Policy Issuance: Offerors must demonstrate that their firm has significant recent and relevant prior experience with any type of easement closings in the geographic area(s) quoted. This includes both the quantity and frequency of conducting the tasks described in the Statement of Work. This will be evidenced by providing details in their quote such as the type of entity the closing was conducted for (federal, state, local government, private business, or a private landowner, etc), the location of the property by county, the nature of the transaction, the types of activities performed (i.e. abstracting, title search, title opinion/commitment, providing title insurance, and closing), and the date.</p>
<p>Personnel Qualifications: All personnel must have a minimum of five (5) years experience having performed the aforementioned types of services. Offerors must identify all personnel who will work on any NRCS projects under any resultant contract. For each person the following type of information must be provided (job title, years of experience, percentage of time spent on pertinent duties, education and any applicable certifications and/or licenses).</p>
<p><br />(x) Offerors are required to complete a copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and submit it with the quote. However, upon award of a BPA each vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) and have completed the online representations and certifications. Alternatively, the offeror may chose to complete their registration in ORCA and provide the first page from the website with their proposal as evidence that it has been completed. This registration must be updated annually. For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

N00244M313     EVALUATION OF OFFERS USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO)

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  

     (i)   TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
     (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
     (iii) PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, services offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, combined with Factor (i), is significantly more important than Factor (iii), PRICE.
 Although cost is not as important as Past Performance, it should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to past performance, or when it is so significantly high as to diminish the value of past performance superiority to the government.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.
  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items or services offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a acceptable record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

ACCEPTABLE:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNACCEPTABLE:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.  All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, and business size.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D.

This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). Interested sources will provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies. Responses must be in compliance with all applicable Army, DoD and Federal policies. <BR><BR>Requirement Statement:<BR>The desired improvements in a next generation GMLRS Unitary (M31A1) rocket are: <BR>1.	Increase the maximum range beyond the current capability of 84 km with no impact on the current minimum range capability of 15 km.  Six missiles per launcher pod is the threshold quantity.<BR>2.	Provide scalable warhead effects equal to the current 200 lb class warhead which may operate in a proximity mode, point detonation mode, or time delay after impact mode.  When selected at the launch platform, a scalable mode will result in a warhead function that decreases collateral damage (i.e., warhead partial detonation/deflagration event or other means that does not leave unexploded ordnance).<BR>3.	Provide an ability to scale the warhead lethal effects up.  The desire is to have lethal effects greater than the current 200 lb class warhead.<BR>A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort may be issued in FY12.

<a href="mailto:debra.elmoreharrell@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Edgewood (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC><BR>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Sensor Processing Group (NBCSPG), which is a mission equipment package used in the Stryker Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) to integrate the vehicle's on-board systems.  The NBCSPG plays a vital role in digitizing the NBC battlespace and provides the soldier with a set of user interfaces to command and monitor disparate NBC sensors and other reconnaissance vehicle systems.  The NBCSPG automatically integrates contamination data, time and location data, meteorological data, and data from other systems to produce NBC hazard intelligence reports.  The NBCSPG interfaces with the NBCRV Command and Control system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2), and automates transmission of NBC reports to and from the NBC battlespace.  A Best Value, full and open competition solicitation is contemplated resulting in a single, 3 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR>The NBCSPG is a collection of hardware and software that processes the information gathered by the sensors, stores it in a database, and helps crewmembers analyze the information, and send electronic reports.  Nuclear Biological Chemical Joint Reconnaissance Application Software (NBCJRAS) is the software that controls and manages the NBCSPG, meteorological, vehicle sensors and other devices.  NBCJRAS includes a Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) software application to provide connectivity to the vehicle's Command and Control (C2) program.  The C2 system for the NBCRV is FBCB2.  <BR>The description of the NBCSPG hardware items are as follows:<BR>NSN for the NBCSPG is 6665-01-537-6899, PN: 5-15-31404. The NBCSPG performance specification is EA-S-2262 and the Interface Control Document is NBCSPG-ICD-31404. <BR>The NBCSPG hardware provides the interface between sensors and crewmembers, and gives crewmembers a way to print the information about the samples collected, and send it to the NBC Operations Center.  It consists of the following components.<BR>1.	 Rugged Notebook Computer Assembly to include a solid state disk drive, battery pack, and CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive module.  The rugged notebook computer assembly has a touchscreen and keyboard that allows it to function as a standalone workstation when docked in the notebook computer docking station.  There are two rugged notebook computer assemblies in the NBCSPG. NSN: 7010-01-572-5500, PN: 5-15-31435<BR>2.	Notebook computer docking station assembly that provides a source of power and secure mounting for the notebook computer.  The docking station includes a port replicator panel which replicates the notebook computer's external interfaces including power.  The docking station assembly also includes a screen support to support the notebook computer screen when the vehicle is in motion; a touchscreen stylus to provide improved operator interaction with the notebook computer; and an Ethernet patch cable to ensure connectivity between the notebook computer, the docking station, and the Ethernet switch.  There are two docking stations in the NBCSPG, one at the surveyors station and one at the commander position. NSN: 7050-01-572-5490, PN: 5-15-31406.<BR>3.	Rugged Keyboard with integrated touch-pad.  The keyboard is sealed to protect it from environmental or accidental damage.  The keyboard also has a backlit keypad that enables the operator to navigate the keyboard with little or no light.  NSN: 7025-01-571-7204, PN: 5-15-31414.<BR>4.	Laser Printer assembly that is housed in a ruggedized case to protect the printer in harsh conditions.  NSN: 7025-01-572-7084, PN: 5-15-31467<BR>5.	Meteorological Display that collects information from the meteorological sensor and the ground temperature probe.  The display routes this information to the NBCSPG interface devices via an RS-232 serial data interface.  NSN: 6660-01-572-5493, PN: 5-15-31425<BR>6.	Meteorological Sensor and Weatherproof cover.  The meteorological sensor is mounted on the exterior of the NBCRV.  The sensor collects wind speed, wind direction, temperature of the surrounding air, air pressure, and relative humidity.

Due to strict Government surveillance requirements, all scrap requiring demilitarization must be processed at a single location, with a segregated storage and processing capacity of a minimum of approximately 3.8 mil pounds of electronic scrap items per year, including associated capabilities for considerable security, accountability and hazardous waste handling requirements. In addition to the capability to demilitarize scrap, the contractor will need the capability to de-manufacture approximately 13.7 MIL pounds per year of non-demil scrap electronics. Non-demil material can be processed at the demil facility or other facilities.
<p>The contractor will need the capability to schedule and pick-up approximately 60 shipments of demil and non-demil property from various CONUS locations per week.&nbsp; The contractor will need the capability for secure inside storage of property at the demil facility. The contractor's demil facility will need warehouse space with approximately 35 thousand square feet of floor space in addition to storage and processing floor space, for spreading out and counting property requiring demilitarization.&nbsp; The contractor will need a shredder, or equivalent process to destroy demil and non-demil property and separate all circuit boards and ferrous and non-ferrous material for return to the Government. The shredded material shall be in pieces with a particle size of not more than 3/4 inch.&nbsp; The corresponding NAICs code is 562920, with the set-aside aspects of any resulting procurement action(s) to be determined in part based upon responses to this sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>Note that this announcement does not constitute a solicitation for these services, or formal announcement of such a solicitation.

Accordingly, the following is requested from interested firms, with a due date of 11 Feb 2011:</p>
<p>1 - A description of your company's capability to provide the services as described in this announcement, including the ability to transport the electronic scrap from throughout CONUS, and accomplish required processing including the associated storage and processing capacity, and anticipated security, accountability, demilitarization and hazardous requirements.

<p>b. A description of the processing facility(s) the contractor would use to process this property in enough detail to show the company's ability to store and process the quantities of material described above. For the demil facility this shall include the open floor space for spreading out and inventorying demil property.</p>
<p>c. A description of the amount of property your company currently processes each year and the excess capacity available to be able to handle an increase in the amount of property in the demil/non-demil quantities of material described above.</p>

<DESC>Additional Classification and NAICS Codes:  <BR>Classification Code: C -- Architect & Engineering Services<BR>NAICS Code: 541330 -- Engineering Services<BR><BR>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the DoD ESTCP web site.  <BR><BR>The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions are found at:<BR><BR> <BR>http://www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations/Installation-Energy-Solicitation <BR><BR><BR>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 24, 2011.  <BR><BR>No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <BR><BR>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal.<BR><BR>Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <BR><BR>Small Business Participation Plans (SBPP) are strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represents 5 percent of the total contract value.  SBPP should be submitted with the full proposal only.  A SBPP is in addition to a subcontracting plan and both large and small vendors need to submit a SBPP to receive maximum credit.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees /$4.5M respectively. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  <BR><BR>The HECSA point of contact for non-technical contracting issues is Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or telephone at 703-428-6420 and for the subcontracting plan is Jackie Robinson-Burnette, Jackie.L.Robinson-Burnette@usace.army.mil or telephone at 202-761-8789.  The point of contact for procedural questions in the ESTCP Office is Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 703-696-2127.  For technical information regarding this announcement, contact the individual listed within the topic area descriptions.<BR>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is NOT a request for quotations. The solicitation will be released on a later date. 

1.  The purpose of this notice is to notify interested contractors that the Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement for a Gearbox Test Stand Upgrade.  The Test Stand will be used to perform dynamic testing of Navy/Marine Corps H53A/D and H53E Main Gearbox assemblies.

All questions relating to this requirement must be addressed to the Contracting Department, Attn: Larry Davis via phone to 252.466.7765 or by e-mail to larry.davis1@usmc.mil.     

2.  DRAFT SPECIFICATION:   The draft specification for this requirement is being provided as an attachment to this notice.  The complete Request for Quotation, including the final specification, will be posted at https://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 16 March 2011.
  Interested contractors are advised that quotations submitted in response to this requirement must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the final specification and terms and conditions stated in the Request for Quotation.     

3.  PRE-SOLICITATION SITE VISIT:  Interested contractors are invited to inspect the site of the existing equipment, which is located at the Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, Building 1798, Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Cherry Point, NC.  

(a)  The Site Visit is scheduled to be conducted on 16 February 2011 at 9:00 a.m. (EST).  Contractors are to assemble in the main lobby of Building 1798 at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the site-visit, where a Government representative will be available to escort participants to the appropriate location(s).
     

(b)  Contractors planning to attend the site visit must submit requests for access to both the MCAS Cherry Point and FRC East as follows:

(i)  Access to MCAS Cherry Point:  Contractors must submit a list of the names of company officials who plan to attend the site visit to larry.davis1@usmc.mil at least five (5) business days prior to the date of the visit.         

(ii)  Access to FRC East:  For security purposes, contractors wishing to visit the FRC East facility are required to provide a letter requesting access.  The letter should be on official company/activity letterhead and must be signed by an official of the requesting organization (other than the visitor).  FRC East visit requests must include the following information:
	Name of Visitor (Last, First, MI)  
	Date and Place of Birth 
	Proof of Citizenship (requests from non-U.S.
 citizens must be accompanied by legible copies (front and back) of work card showing expiration date.

	Date and duration of visit 
	Company telephone and FAX numbers and contract number and dates

	Commanding Officer
	Attn: Visitor Control (Code 6.5.2)

	PSC Box 8021
	Cherry Point, NC  28533-0021

(d)  Visit request must be faxed to 252.464.8867 at least three (3) working days prior to the visit.  

(e)  Although a security clearance is not required for the site visit, all contractor representatives must be U.S. citizens and will be required to furnish a valid drivers license or other generally acceptable form of picture identification for issuance of a visitors badge allowing for entrance into the facility.
  Substitution of personnel is not allowed.  Photography, including cellular telephones with camera capability, and/or the use of recording devices within the facility is strictly prohibited   

(f)  Additional information regarding access to the Air Station and FRC East is available by phone at 252.464.7397 or by accessing the FRC East web-site at  https://www.navair.navy.mil/frce/visinfo.html.   Failure to submit the proper visit request information may result in denial of access to the facility.  Additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.

4.  The MCAS Cherry Point main gate is located off NC State Highway 101, Havelock, NC.  Visitors without proper vehicle identification are required to check-in at the visitors center adjacent to the main gate.
  Once through the Main Gate, proceed to Building 1798.   Directions from the main gate to Building 1798 are available upon request at the visitors center.  Participants should allow at least one hour for check-in at the main gate and travel to the FRC East location.  Participants will depart from the main lobby of Building 1798 promptly at 9:00 AM EST. Participants arriving late will NOT be included in the Site Visit.  

5.  Participants will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of hearing protection, eye protection, and safety shoes.  PPE will not be provided by the facility.  Contractor representatives without the appropriate PPE will not be allowed access to the facility and additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.

6.
  The purpose of the site visit is to allow contractors the opportunity to inspect the site of the existing equipment (where the new equipment is to be installed) in order to be better able to relate to the specification requirements.  The site visit, in conjunction with the work requirements identified in the final specification, should provide contractors a detailed understanding of the requirement.

7.  The site visit is not intended to be a pre-proposal conference and therefore will NOT be an open forum for questions.  Contractors must submit questions concerning, or request clarification of, any aspect of the draft specification electronically via e-mail to larry.davis1@usmc.mil no later than 02 March 2011.
   Comments and questions must reference Request for Quotation M00146-11-T-9018.  

8.  Failure of a contractor to submit questions regarding this requirement or to attend the Site Visit will be construed to mean that the contractor fully understands all requirements of the final specification and Request for Quotation.  In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  

9.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

<DESC>Q&A Set #2 Continued:

Question 9:	Is it desired that all power output receptacles be Mil Spec?

Answer 9:	No.  But they should be highly reliable in a military environment.

Question 10:	Do you want the unit to be expandable? (i.e.  Have the capability to plug into another unit to double battery and solar capacity and double continuous power output.)

Answer 10:	Expandability would be desirable.

Question 11: 	Will shipping be the responsibility of the contractor or is the USMC going to provide shipping to overseas locations from the U.S.?

Answer 11:	Contractor shipment to CONUS locations (I.E. Dover, DE), then Government would take care of shipment from there.

Question 12:	Since Lithium Batteries are classified for shipping as a Class 9 Dangerous Good.
  Is there any special protocol that the USMC has in place for shipping these types of items that should be adhered to when packaging the unit for shipment?  (Typically we would go off of international shipping regulations such as IATA, DOT or UN standards.)

Answer 12:	We would like industry to address any special provisions and conditions as it would relate to safety and transportation aspects of their notional solutions.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-2
<AWDNBR>HHSM-500-2006-M0001Z
<MODNBR>000043
<DESC>This justification is to obtain approval for CMS to extend the contract period of performance, adding two six month extension periods (the 2nd of which should be established as an option period), for the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contract (DME MAC) in Jurisdiction A (JA) only for sufficient time as to conclude re-procurement efforts that are currently in progress. It is anticipated that a new contract award will be made in January 2011; therefore, the proposed 2nd six-month option period may or may not be exercised. Each six month period is estimated at approximately $9.2m.
<p>This justification for other than full and open competition is predicated on the understanding that CMS is currently engaged in a full and open competition in accordance with Section 1874A of the Social Security Act and with Federal Acquisition Requirements for the work performed by the DME MAC in Jurisdiction A (see FedBizOps solicitation RFP-CMS-2010-0004, J-01 SOW). The solicitation for this contract was issued a full 12 months before contract end. However, the procurement award decision has been delayed and is not expected before the end of the NHIC's current contract. Therefore, based on the compelling urgency that Medicare claims administration work cannot be disrupted, CMS must take action to continue the work with NHIC.</p>

<DESC>Reference DOSAR 606.303-2 <br />FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY<br />JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (DOMESTIC CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES)
<p>1. I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of to perform Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) services at Camp Sullivan, Kabul, Afghanistan. Mobilization - Travel: Total Price - $268,876.00 and Camp Sullivan: Total Price - $487,962.00. The total estimated cost is $756,838.00.<br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Department of State has requested that PAE take over the O &amp; M, custodial, and laundry services at the Camp Sullivan location, since the incumbent contractor has been removed from providing these services. PAE will furnish all management, supervision, labor, tools, and equipment required to perform O &amp; M for electrical, HVAC, and plumbing, and provide custodial, laundry, and gardening services. PAE will subcontract to provide sewage/grease, and garbage removal services.<br /><br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. The American Embassy Kabul will assign a COR to provide administrative direction, oversight of Camp Sullivan and will follow U.S. Embassy policy and procedure. PAE will be responsible for maintaining sufficient staff to operate and maintain Camp Sullivan.<br /><br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USC 253(c) (2), FAR 6.302-2 - Compelling Urgency. Since it is bridge until new contract that includes Camp Sullivan begins. PAE is the only firm that can provide these services, starting January 1, 2011.<br /><br />5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited). The proposed contractor, PAE Government Services, is the United States of America firm that serves as the "responsible applicant of record" for the Kabul Embassy, Afghanistan O &amp; M project. PAE has been providing O &amp; M services for Kabul Embassy, Afghanistan project for the past five years and has an unequalled<br />knowledge of the project. As the "applicant of record" they must continue to serve O &amp; M services at Camp Sullivan, and provide support for contract activities to include Work Order for Window (WOW) desk operations, Quality Control, Safety inspections, procurement and warehouse support.<br /><br />6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2. This procurement will be publicized in the FedBizOps notice or any other announcement board. This will increase competitors and market research information for future use. The FedBiz Announcement is anticipated to be released on December 22, 2010.<br /><br />7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. PAE has provided services to the Kabul embassy for the last five years, hiring subconsultants as needed. The embassy has maintained that their rates are fair and reasonable for Camp Sullivan. No other firm could perform these services, making their rates reasonable by default. Services shall begin on or about January 1, 2011. PAE will submit an invoice for the full price of Mobilization $268,876.00 USD in the first month, and $487,962.00 USD to be billed monthly using the Purchase Order number. Total value of mobilization and three (3) month performance period is $756,838.00. Invoice payments shall be made to the contractor in US dollars payable by electronic funds transfer.<br /><br />8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. No market research was performed as only the contractor of record with the licenses can provide the required services indicated in item number 1 of this J&amp;A.<br /><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. PAE will provide the O &amp; M services based on the Statement of Work. All services shall be fully functional 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. PAE has provided related services to Kabul Embassy, Afghanistan for the past five years and therefore has a unique and detailed knowledge of the O &amp; M Services. No other firm has this background or legal standing. PAE maintain a robust export compliance program implemented through an import/Export Office staffed by skilled export professionals. Their programs support to embassy and peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan, and support to U.S. embassies and military bases worldwide.<br /><br />10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br /><br />11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. In this case it is not practical to overcome any barriers because they exist because of the type of contract OBO is trying to award. PAE will ensure full compliance with USG contracting policies and directives in selection of vendors and subcontractors, or during any procurement activities that may be required under the proposed project. Local subcontractors will be required to adhere to PAE procurement policies as part of their written subcontract agreement.</p>
