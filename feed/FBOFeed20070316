<DESC>The firm must have five (5) or more years of successful design & manufacture of this type of WLS Fiber. And, must be able to produce & ship 18,000 km of 0.7 mm diameter WLS Fiber (fully meeting Spec. requirements) over a 4 year period (11/07 - 9/11). The light generated in the Fiber must have Attenuation length of at least 16 - 20 m. Fiber is composed of a clear polystyrene core doped with a fluorescent dye and clad with a layer of PMMA and a layer of fluorinated polymer. The dye, K27 or equivalent, absorbs blue light entering the core and shifts the wavelength by >75 nm from blue to yellow-green light. The dye has a high efficiency for conversion of the blue light and a low attenuation for the green light. The two (2) free ends of the loop guide the transmitted light to an avalanche photodiode. The Fiber, whether bent or straight, must be resistant to damage by the liquid scintillator (cladding continuity is essential here) and maintain its light yield for at least 15 years.

<DESC>The U.S. Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. organizations interested in providing services to promote sustainable licit development in the communities and regions affected by illicit coca cultivation in Peru.  The Promoting Integrated Development activity will be the principal mechanism in the USAID/Peru Alternative Development Program (ADP) over the 2008-2012 period.  The goals are to:  1)  assist significant numbers of new communities and families to transition to a licit lifestyle after programmed eradication; 2) ensure the sustainability of the licit development gains that have been made to date and commitment to licit lifestyles in the 800 communities of the 2002-2006 voluntary eradication program by consolidating those gains; and, if circumstances necessitate, 3) enroll a limited number of new communities and families into the ongoing program after voluntary eradication of their coca.  The primary focus of the activity will be post-programmed eradication alternative development, with a somewhat lower level of investment of resources on consolidating the gains of the current program.

USAID plans to award a cost reimbursement completion-type contract with a total estimated cost estimated of $75 to $80 million covering a total estimated period of five years:  a three (3) years base period and two (2) one-year option periods.   Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  It should be understood that this is a follow-on activity to the Participatory Alternative Development activity that is currently being implemented by Chemonics International under a cost-reimbursement award-fee type contract that expires on March 31, 2008.  The incumbent is not eliminated from this competition.

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time and that contract award is also subject to the approval of Mission Operational Plans.  This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about March 30, 2007.  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.  Telephonic requests or inquiries pertaining to details regarding this RFP will not be taken.  Responses to this RFP will be due approximately 45 days after release of the formal solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A--DEMONSTRATE ADVANCED AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD) MISSION APPLICATIONS
<SOLNBR>BAAN0464A0703
<RESPDATE>041607
<ARCHDATE>04162008
<CONTACT>Jim Knesel 301-744-6886
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to demonstrate existing state-of-the-art autonomous robotic capabilities for the purpose of assessing and enhancing its research and development effort.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to identify advanced robotic technology developments that may ultimately be integrated into currently fielded and/or future EOD unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) configurations. BACKGROUND:  The use of UGVs as a primary response tool for the EOD operator has increased dramatically for in-theater operational uses.  Using current generation tele-operated UGVs in unstructured environments places a large workload on the operator.  There exists a need for incorporating advanced autonomous capabilities into EOD UGVs to automate common tasks such as navigation, driving, and manipulation.  These advances will allow more of the UGV operator's attention to be placed on EOD procedure selection and execution and on monitoring the surrounding environment.  Autonomous capabilities also have the potential for decreasing overall mission time.   TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION: Interested firms are requested to submit white papers/full proposals that define the effort to demonstrate their advanced autonomous capabilities for application to EOD UGVs.  These proposed projects may include the performance of limited development to tailor an existing capability to the EOD mission and to demonstrate that capability on-site at NAVEODTECHDIV, Indian Head, MD.  EOD UGV enhancements are sought in the following technology areas: 1. MANIPULATION - Many EOD UGV manipulators have limited autonomous capabilities, requiring the operator to directly control the joints of robot.  Capabilities that allow the manipulator end-effectors to be controlled directly in 3-D space have been developed, but the user is still required to directly control the manipulator using feedback from the UGV cameras.  The capability is desired that would allow the manipulator to be moved autonomously; requiring only high level input and supervision from the operator.  For example, the operator might select an item of interest on their display and manipulator would then move to within a predetermined distance of that object.  Some common tasks that are performed using robotic manipulators are:  picking up and placing EOD tools and ordnance, opening doors, digging, using hand-tools and power tools (drills, saws, etc.).  2. NAVIGATION - Fielded EOD UGVs are tele-operated and have no autonomous navigation capabilities.  This requires the operator to drive and navigate the robot both down range to the mission area and back up range to the command post.  Capability is desired that will allow the UGV to drive and navigate autonomously requiring only high level input and supervision from the operator. 3. INSPECTION/IDENTIFICATION - Target inspection and identification is currently performed by the EOD operator using the UGV video cameras.  This procedure can prove inadequate at providing vital target information to the EOD technician, requiring the operator to move down range and personally inspect the target.  Capability is desired that will improve situational awareness of the down range environment (e.g. location of target relative to other buildings, vehicles, and objects) as well as the target itself (e.g. size, shape, color, markings). EOD MISSION: Technology demonstrations of existing autonomous capabilities for UGVs are required that apply to tasks identified in the following EOD mission profile: (a) Unload UGV from transport vehicle; (b) Drive UGV down range to target location; (c) Perform reconnaissance of  target and target area; (d) Use of manipulator to perform render-safe operations (e.g. place or aim tools and sensors, pick-up ordnance, clear debris and dirt); (e) Verification of success of EOD procedure and additional reconnaissance; (f) Drive robot back to command post; (g) Load UGV into transport vehicle. WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not be considered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to five pages in length and may address any one, or combination of the technology areas defined above.  The white paper shall consist of three primary sections: Technical, Management, and Cost.  The Technical section shall state which categories are being addressed and shall consist of clear descriptions of objectives, technical issues which must be resolved to accomplish objectives, approach to resolving these issues, and particular prior experience of offeror in the targeted technology areas.  The Management portion shall include key personnel (include curriculum vitae), experience, facilities and a plan of action with milestones.  The Cost portion shall include a cost breakdown of the effort being pr!  oposed.  The period of performance shall not exceed four (4) months in length and the total cost shall not exceed $100,000.  White papers shall be submitted not later than 3:00 PM (EDT) on 16 April 2007.  It is anticipated that the evaluation of the white papers will be completed and the results disseminated to Offerors by 07 May 2007. FULL PROPOSALS:  The Government will request full proposals based on the merits of the white papers received.  Full proposals will not be limited as to the number of pages and shall consist of three sections, Technical, Management, and Cost.  All sections shall reference the BAA number and include the Offeror's project title.  Titles given to the white papers/proposals should address the technology areas that are being proposed.  Proposals submitted shall include the following sections:  (a) cover page including unique title and both technical and business points of contact; (b) statement of work (SOW) detailing scope of work and a detailed description of each task; (c) list of Government furnished information and Government furnished equipment (GFE) required; (d) a detailed cost breakdown by task including labor categories, labor rates, labor hours, labor overhead rate and total labor cost.  If subcontractors are involved, include a cost breakdown for each subcontractor exh!  ibiting the same parameters.  Subcontractors may send their details separately or they may provide them along with the prime in a sealed envelope.  Also include material cost, travel and any other direct or indirect costs.  If the Offeror has an approved purchasing system, provide the source and date of latest review.  If the offeror does not have an approved purchasing system, state what processes are used for purchases of such items as material, travel, and training; materials, travel, and any remaining direct or indirect costs; (e) a description of deliverables; (f) a schedule including milestones and a time/cost profile; (g) a description of the Offeror's facilities, key personnel and experience in the area of interest.  It is anticipated that full proposals will be due in the June 2007 timeframe.  The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right !  to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in respo nse to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA. EVALUATIONS:  White papers and full proposals will be evaluated using the following selection criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits; (2) Understanding of EOD requirements and the technical/scientific innovation and risk to solve the requirement; (3) Potential for transition to fleet/field capability; (4) The Offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) Potential capability gained by EOD; (6) Proposed cost and fees.  The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement. The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small bus!  iness concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses. Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality !  of reserving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technolo gy for exclusive competition among these entities. SUBMISSIONS: White paper/full proposals submissions must be in hard copy, with one (1) original copy and three (3) photocopies.  Each offeror should submit a cover sheet with its white paper/proposal.

<SUBJECT>A--DEMONSTRATE ADVANCED AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD) MISSION APPLICATIONS
<SOLNBR>N0464ABAA0703
<RESPDATE>041607
<ARCHDATE>04162007
<CONTACT>Jim Knesel 301-744-6886
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to demonstrate existing state-of-the-art autonomous robotic capabilities for the purpose of assessing and enhancing its research and development effort.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to identify advanced robotic technology developments that may ultimately be integrated into currently fielded and/or future EOD unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) configurations. BACKGROUND:  The use of UGVs as a primary response tool for the EOD operator has increased dramatically for in-theater operational uses.  Using current generation tele-operated UGVs in unstructured environments places a large workload on the operator.  There exists a need for incorporating advanced autonomous capabilities into EOD UGVs to automate common tasks such as navigation, driving, and manipulation.  These advances will allow more of the UGV operator’s attention to be placed on EOD procedure selection and execution and on monitoring the surrounding environment.  Autonomous capabilities also have the potential for decreasing overall mission time.   TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION: Interested firms are requested to submit white papers/full proposals that define the effort to demonstrate their advanced autonomous capabilities for application to EOD UGVs.  These proposed projects may include the performance of limited development to tailor an existing capability to the EOD mission and to demonstrate that capability on-site at NAVEODTECHDIV, Indian Head, MD.  EOD UGV enhancements are sought in the following technology areas: 1. MANIPULATION – Many EOD UGV manipulators have limited autonomous capabilities, requiring the operator to directly control the joints of robot.  Capabilities that allow the manipulator end-effectors to be controlled directly in 3-D space have been developed, but the user is still required to directly control the manipulator using feedback from the UGV cameras.  The capability is desired that would allow the manipulator to be moved autonomously; requiring only high level input and supervision from the operator.  For example, the operator might select an item of interest on their display and manipulator would then move to within a predetermined distance of that object.  Some common tasks that are performed using robotic manipulators are:  picking up and placing EOD tools and ordnance, opening doors, digging, using hand-tools and power tools (drills, saws, etc.).  2. NAVIGATION – Fielded EOD UGVs are tele-operated and have no autonomous navigation capabilities.  This requires the operator to drive and navigate the robot both down range to the mission area and back up range to the command post.  Capability is desired that will allow the UGV to drive and navigate autonomously requiring only high level input and supervision from the operator. 3. INSPECTION/IDENTIFICATION – Target inspection and identification is currently performed by the EOD operator using the UGV video cameras.  This procedure can prove inadequate at providing vital target information to the EOD technician, requiring the operator to move down range and personally inspect the target.  Capability is desired that will improve situational awareness of the down range environment (e.g. location of target relative to other buildings, vehicles, and objects) as well as the target itself (e.g. size, shape, color, markings). EOD MISSION: Technology demonstrations of existing autonomous capabilities for UGVs are required that apply to tasks identified in the following EOD mission profile: (a) Unload UGV from transport vehicle; (b) Drive UGV down range to target location; (c) Perform reconnaissance of  target and target area; (d) Use of manipulator to perform render-safe operations (e.g. place or aim tools and sensors, pick-up ordnance, clear debris and dirt); (e) Verification of success of EOD procedure and additional reconnaissance; (f) Drive robot back to command post; (g) Load UGV into transport vehicle. WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not be considered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to five pages in length and may address any one, or combination of the technology areas defined above.  The white paper shall consist of three primary sections: Technical, Management, and Cost.  The Technical section shall state which categories are being addressed and shall consist of clear descriptions of objectives, technical issues which must be resolved to accomplish objectives, approach to resolving these issues, and particular prior experience of offeror in the targeted technology areas.  The Management portion shall include key personnel (include curriculum vitae), experience, facilities and a plan of action with milestones.  The Cost portion shall include a cost breakdown of the effort being pr!  oposed.  The period of performance shall not exceed four (4) months in length and the total cost shall not exceed $100,000.  White papers shall be submitted not later than 3:00 PM (EDT) on 16 April 2007.  It is anticipated that the evaluation of the white papers will be completed and the results disseminated to Offerors by 07 May 2007. FULL PROPOSALS:  The Government will request full proposals based on the merits of the white papers received.  Full proposals will not be limited as to the number of pages and shall consist of three sections, Technical, Management, and Cost.  All sections shall reference the BAA number and include the Offeror’s project title.  Titles given to the white papers/proposals should address the technology areas that are being proposed.  Proposals submitted shall include the following sections:  (a) cover page including unique title and both technical and business points of contact; (b) statement of work (SOW) detailing scope of work and a detailed description of each task; (c) list of Government furnished information and Government furnished equipment (GFE) required; (d) a detailed cost breakdown by task including labor categories, labor rates, labor hours, labor overhead rate and total labor cost.  If subcontractors are involved, include a cost breakdown for each subcontractor exh!  ibiting the same parameters.  Subcontractors may send their details separately or they may provide them along with the prime in a sealed envelope.  Also include material cost, travel and any other direct or indirect costs.  If the Offeror has an approved purchasing system, provide the source and date of latest review.  If the offeror does not have an approved purchasing system, state what processes are used for purchases of such items as material, travel, and training; materials, travel, and any remaining direct or indirect costs; (e) a description of deliverables; (f) a schedule including milestones and a time/cost profile; (g) a description of the Offeror’s facilities, key personnel and experience in the area of interest.  It is anticipated that full proposals will be due in the June 2007 timeframe.  The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right !  to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in respo nse to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA. EVALUATIONS:  White papers and full proposals will be evaluated using the following selection criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits; (2) Understanding of EOD requirements and the technical/scientific innovation and risk to solve the requirement; (3) Potential for transition to fleet/field capability; (4) The Offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) Potential capability gained by EOD; (6) Proposed cost and fees.  The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement. The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small bus!  iness concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses. Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality !  of reserving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technolo gy for exclusive competition among these entities. SUBMISSIONS: White paper/full proposals submissions must be in hard copy, with one (1) original copy and three (3) photocopies.  Each offeror should submit a cover sheet with its white paper/proposal.  This cover sheet, which will not be counted against any page restrictions and should include the BAA number, name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address for the technical and business points of contact.

The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $50,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.  Sensitivity to NPS values, standards, and sustainable design principles must be demonstrated.

The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the MWRO, the MWRO occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the sub consultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub consultant, MWRO will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the MWRO will continue to acquire such specialized services.  The MWRO does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub consultant's services.  Specialized services may include but are not limited to the following:  Level II and/or Level III environmental site assessments (investigation to be conducted per Secretarial Order 3127 and Part 602 Land Acquisition), Chapter 2 - Hazardous Substances Determinations, Section 2.5 - Requirements, Functions, and Procedures; and identification of and sampling of suspect asbestos containing materials and NEPA services in accordance with National Park Service policy.

A/E shall identify facilitator(s) with Certified Value Specialist (CVS as certified by SAVE International) or approved equal, to conduct studies and consult with the prime with regard to decision making methods.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria which listed in descending order of importance: 1.Professional qualifications of the principals and key staff of the firm and consultants for the performance of the desired services.   2.Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required and knowledge of a broad range of project localities in the 13 states of the National Park Service, Midwest Region.  3.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, biosafety testing of master cell banks and retroviral vector supernatants with BioReliance, 14920 Broschart Road, Rockville, MD 20850.

The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 12 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The purpose of this contract is to acquire biosafety testing services for release of retrovirus-producing master cell banks and clinical grade retroviral vector generated within the NCI.  Contractor shall comply with good manufacturing practices (GMP).  There is currently a need for the development of new and more effective immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with melanoma as well as a variety of other cancers that are refractory to current treatments.

The majority of patients with advanced metastatic cancer now enrolled in the NCI clinical trials have failed conventional and most experimental treatments such as chemotherapy, treatment with cytokine proteins, vaccination with tumor antigen peptides and recombinant viruses that encode tumor antigens.  The retrovirus-producing master cell banks and clinical grade retroviral vector generated within the NCI will support clinical protocols within NCI such as adoptive transfer of tumor reactive T cells.  NCI patients with metastatic melanoma have a median survival time of six (6) months, and patients rarely survive longer than three (3) years.  Between three hundred (300) and four hundred (400) new patients with metastatic melanoma are now being treated in the NCI each year.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months upon date of award with four (4), one (1) year options.   
This procurement will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract with a minimum of one (1) to a maximum of ten (10) master cell banks.

BioReliance Corporation is the only known source to the NCI that is a comprehensive facility that is capable of supplying the necessary biosafety testing of our master cell bank and retroviral vectors.  BioReliance has developed and validated a rigorous series of safety testing protocols with significant Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) oversight in accordance with accepted regulatory guidelines.  In addition, the proposed clinical trials may have a direct impact on patient survival, and it is therefore crucial that these products be obtained without delay.  The need to develop experiment protocols and verify that these procedures can be utilized for larger clinical trials is essential to the development of life-saving therapies. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT March 26, 2007.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-70041-NG on all correspondence.

The following is a general list of the specific duties anticipated for Procurement Agents. A more comprehensive list will be outlined in the solicitation: 1) Analyze market conditions in order to optimize the success of the procurement activity; 2) Plan, schedule and prioritize procurement functions; 3) Ensure that all procurement related approvals required under the Compact and any supplemental agreement are obtained from MCC; 4) Conduct procurements in a manner to provide open competition to the maximum extent practical in order to assure advantageous prices for the Accountable Entity as well as equal and fair access for eligible suppliers and contractors; 5) Guard against conflicts of interest, real or in appearance, in the operations of the procurement activity and 6) Protect the procurement from fraud waste and abuse. Critical milestones for this procurement are anticipated as follows: 1) Issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) on 03/14/07; 2) Questions in response to RFP due on 3/26/07; 3) Pre-Proposal Conference on 4/02/07; 4) Proposals due on 4/16/07 and 5) Contract executed on 5/18/07.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>UPDATE: The RFP for this acquisition has been updated.  A summation of the amendments has been posted on the bidder's library under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access.  

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

               (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
               (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.  

The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) 

AMENDMENT 03
	
This is an amendment to a request for information and not a solicitation.

The purpose of this amendment is to announce that the STAT team will host a working group meeting with industry and Government personnel to further discuss system requirements.  The tentative dates for this meeting are 15-17 May 2007 at Arnold Air Force Base Tennessee.  Details of the meeting will be provided in a subsequent amendment.  

FYI.  The STAT will be a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects.  STAT will provide connectivity to a satellite control center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats.  STAT is envisioned to include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources.   STAT Spiral 1 will develop the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test sub-system size components and microsats.

<SUBJECT>61--Remote Power Station to the remote area of Delta Alaska
<SOLNBR>N0024407T0258
<RESPDATE>032307
<CONTACT>Cuc Tran 562-626-7139
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted under this solicitation as follows: Question: It is not possible to provide the power required in 3.1.1.1 using a full day of sunlight much less 2 sun hours per day.  See the attached chart specifically for the Delta area.  The chart uses 16 PV panels and as you can see in the months of November, December and January the power requirement can't be met.  Even if the number of solar panels was increased to 64 it still can not be met. Answer: The maximum weekly power draw is 30000WH.  A 2600 Watt Array with a 90% efficiency will produce an average of 32760WH per week based on 2 sun hrs per day.  Only in Nov - Jan are the sun hrs less than 2. (Worst case is Dec. when it generates 10282WH per week).  However during this time the wind generator should produce between 15000 and 20000WH per week and meet the load requirements.  Additionally, increasing the number of panels in the solar array should increase WH produced and thereby meet the operational requirements. The generator is primarily an alternate backup for the instances that wind and solar both fail. Question:  Where is the outfitting to take place?  Construction costs 3 times more in the bush than in town. Answer:  Preliminary outfitting of the shelters can occur at a contractor specified facility.  However final integration and installation has to occur at the remote sites.  The contractor is responsible for any transportation of the shelters from their preliminary integration site to the Big Delta staging Area.  The government is responsible for delivering the shelters to the contractor specified preliminary integration site and from the Big Delta Staging Area to the remote sites where the final installation will occur. Question:  How are the shelters constructed, wood, foam panels, steel, or brick? Answer:  The Shelters are insulated portable steel buildings originally manufactured by Mobile Mini. Question:  What are the soil conditions, is it bedrock, tundra, river rock? Answer: The soil is primarily frozen tundra.  However, only minimal disturbing of the ground should be necessary.  The contractor will need to install the Wind Generator pole but the shelters will be placed on existing GFE frames optimized for the shelters.  No soil survey has performed at the remote sites. Question:  How are the sites accessed, can you drive to them or is a helicopter required? Answer: Helicopter, requires coordination from Eielson AFB Range Control Office Question:  Will transportation be provided for construction if on-site, for warranty work, for start-up? Answer: No, this is part of the contract costs and requirements Question:  Will lodging be provided? Answer: No, There are no facilities on at the remote sites.  Lodging is the responsibility of the contractor.  NSWC COR generally stays in the Fairbanks/Eielson AFB area.  Overnight stays at the remote sites must be coordinated with the Eielson AFB Range Control Office and may or may not be approved. The date and time of proposal submission is extended to 23 March 2007 at 15:00PM, Pacific time

<DESC>Web Based E-Learning for Saudi Arabia This is a combined Sources Sought and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)  Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor  does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This  synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any  purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This  Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United  States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for the upgrade of the Royal  Saudi Air Force (RSAF) School of Command, Control and Communications  (School of C3) at Prince Sultan Air Base, located in Al Kharj, Saudi  Arabia.  In addition, we are also asking that each interested source  provide this office with an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude) of their  perceived overall cost of this requirement. Specifically, the contractor will provide all engineering services to  fabricate/procure, install and deliver to the RSAF a turnkey system  totally modernizing a minimum of eleven (11) up to a maximum of twenty  three (23) classrooms at the School of C3. In this effort the contractor will be required to include the networking  of classrooms, replacement and upgrading of student and instructor  workstations, integration of electronic presentation aids, and  modernization/rehabilitation of the classrooms.  The RSAF has also stated  that they wanted to migrate the current 1,502 Computer Based Training  modules from a Macintosh based system to a “state-of-the-art” PC based  system.  This effort specifically requires that the contractor re-validate  and modernize the training course content and that the course content  reflects the configuration of the newly installed equipment.  The RSAF has  also stressed their desire to accomplish distance learning, which also  includes two-way voice and data communications along with a redesign and  installation of the Local Area Network(LAN). Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly  voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that s  submitted by respondents to this synopsis.  The Government requests  interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no  later than 4:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on 10 April 2007 to the  following address:  For first class mail -  AFSAC/PKT Attn: Jeff Smith,  Bldg. 210, Area C, 1822 Van Patten Drive, WPAFB Ohio 45433-5337.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is issuing this Notice of Intent to issue a Request for Applications (RFA) for one or more cooperative agreements for a development activity centered upon a regional roads program for Strategic Provincial Roads-South and East Afghanistan (SPR-SEA). Eligible prime recipients are for-profit and nonprofit nongovernmental organizations in USAID Geographic Code 935 (any area or country including the cooperating country, but excluding foreign policy-restricted countries) and public international organizations. The prime recipient would not receive profit or fee, but for-profit entities could receive profit or fee as sub-recipients. Each cooperative agreement program would include development assistance components such as roads construction and rehabilitation, capacity building and community development, along with the sustainability and appropriate technology objectives of local contractor development and community based maintenance programs. Central to the program will be the construction of all-weather, gravel-surfaced roads. Each successful prime awardee/recipient will be responsible for all aspects of its agreement program, including site security and de-mining.  USAID hopes to increase the number of partners working in Afghanistan.  Interested potential prime and sub-recipient entities are encouraged to form teams that will help to achieve this objective, while at the same time providing strong technical, capacity building and community development capabilities.  Additionally, USAID recognizes that many prominent for-profit infrastructure service providers might not be completely familiar with the Federal assistance business arena envisioned by the USAID Automated Directives System 303 and 22 CFR 226.  This early alert should allow for research time.  In this context, it is suggested that entities might also find it advantageous to familiarize themselves with topics like “corporate social responsibility” since USAID might eventually decide that cost sharing or leveraging will be appropriate evaluation and selection process factors due to their proven ability to extend the development impact of USAID-direct funding.  USAID anticipates providing an estimated USD 400 million over the course of approximately two to three years for this program.  Interested parties should monitor the www.grants.gov website for issuance of the RFA, which is expected to occur in the near future.  Organizations interested in participating in the SPR-SEA program should submit an expression of interest via email to the Point of Contact below.  The email expression of interest should have SPR-SEA as the subject, and provide the name of the organization, contact name, and email address.  USAID intends to compile a list of organizations expressing interest in response to this Notice, and will furnish the list to each interested party for the purposes of facilitating partnering arrangements.  Point of Contact:  apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking  to identify sources for two non-competitve procurements of  $500.00 each, to assist, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in managing Part A and B Medicare eligibility access and on-line system for contracting Medicare Advantage Plans enrolling Medicare entitled beneficiaries. These contracts will also provide a method for CMS contracting Health Plans and PDPs to submit enrollment data records to the CMS data center.    

The contractor must provide a daily need for query access to eligibility data on beneficiaries enrolling into their organizations.  Some plans do not have the resources or systems to handle these queries, and so they opt to use a vendor.  Currently, CMS provide Medicare covered health care, prescription drug coverage, and other medical services to Medicare beneficiaries who chose to enroll in their plan.  CMS contracts with about 700 plans.  These plans are located in 50 states, with heavy concentrations in California and Florida. CMS are servicing approximately 30 million Medicare beneficiaries.

Potential sources may identify their interest and capability in response to the above requirements by submitting clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the established requirements.  This sources sought notice is for informational purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Interest expressed within 10 calendar days of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of identifying capable vendors. Written requests should be submitted to Evelyn A.

Description
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the applicable electric, water, and wastewater distribution systems at Defense Supply Center Columbus (DDSC).  

DSCC, a 530-acre Installation located on the east side of Columbus, Ohio, continues to serve the nation as one of the most important installations in the Department of Defense.  DSCC is a procurement and supply activity supporting the military services, other DoD components, and federal civil agencies around the world.  It contains 54 buildings.  Known to 24,000 military and civilian customers as the largest supplier of weapons systems spare parts and end items, DSCC is one of the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA) largest Inventory Control Points.

DSCC-Columbus Electrical: DSCC currently purchases electric power at 138 kV from American Electric Power Company (AEP).  The Main Substation is supplied from AEP’s 138 kV transmission line. It consists of two 138 kV transmission line terminations, two 20 MVA 138-13.2 kV LTC (load tap changing) power transformers, and seventeen 15 kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated substation configured in a double-ended main bus arrangement. The substation provides voltage regulation, control, and over-current protection for eight 13.2 kV distribution feeders, and includes four spare circuit breakers for future feeders.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, wood pole, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. However, there is also underground primary construction (utilizing duct type construction practices and pad-mounted transformers). 




The underground primary facilities are generally arranged in a looped configuration.  It is believed that all PCB-contaminated transformers have been retired and removed from the Center.  The electric utility system includes one 138 kV distribution substation, approximately 69,000 linear feet of 13.2 kV overhead primary distribution line and approximately 35,000 linear feet of 13.2 kV underground primary distribution line.  Installation dates for the distribution lines range from 1971 to 1996 while the substation was installed in 1997.
  
DSCC-Columbus Water:  Potable water used at DSCC is supplied by the City of Columbus.  DSCC uses well water for irrigation of the golf course; this system is not being transferred as part of this privatization effort.  The Center connects to the City’s water system at three locations.  The average water pressure at the Center is about 70 pounds per square inch (psi).  The Center’s water distribution system consists of about 78,000 feet of water piping including mains and service connections the majority of which is cast iron.  Pipe size ranges from 6 to 12 inches with the most predominant pipe size being 8 inch.  Installation dates range from 1947 to 1974.

DSCC-Columbus Wastewater:  Domestic wastewater generated on DSCC is transferred to the City of Columbus treatment facilities for treatment.  The Center connects to the City’s 24-inch line at 4 points.  The Center’s wastewater collection system consists of approximately 38,000 linear feet of piping, ranging in size from 4 to 18 inches, two lift stations, and about 151 manholes. For the most part, the wastewater lines are vitrified clay pipe. The two lift stations are both duplex submersible pump types and were constructed in 1996 and 1998 respectively.  Pipe size ranges from 4 to 18 inches with the most predominant size of pipe being 8 inches.  Installation dates of the pipe range from 1932 to 1977.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT 05/30/2007.  






Please specify which systems you are interested in. Responses shall be submitted by email in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format to Michael Simon at Michael.simon@dla.mil. Email shall reference:  Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC).

Interested parties shall reply by submitting a response not later than 16 April 2007 by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  The sources sought announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to ultimately award a contract, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<CONTACT>Bridgett Baer Baer.Bridgett@mail.va.gov
<DESC>Request for Information:  To help ensure public confidence in VA research efforts, ensure responsible use of VA funds, and to protect the health and welfare of animals used in research, the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) has adopted measures to provide specific central oversight and field research support mechanisms. No matter what source of funds is used to conduct animal research, all VA programs must be accredited by AAALAC, and abide by all applicable VA, Public Health Service (PHS), FDA and USDA regulations.   Primary responsibility for providing adequate budgetary and administrative support to meet these criteria lies with the local program.  On behalf of the institution, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is given regulatory authority and responsibility for the animal care and use program.  Each VA program that performs animal research must have an IACUC, although the VA program may rely utilize the academic affiliate's IACUC as its own.  Thus, the ability of the IACUC to properly execute its responsibilities is crucial to maintaining a compliant animal care and use program. Consistent with its critical role as the institution's self-regulatory body, each institutional IACUC has the following basic charges: Uphold and maintain the tenets of the most current Department of Veterans Affairs Handbook governing animal research (1200.7), the USDA Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR), and the Public Health Service (PHS) policies.  Provide impartial initial review of any protocol involving the use of animals within the institution. Provide reviews of all modification requests to established and approved protocols involving the use of animals. Provide assurance that staff and investigators are trained in current best practices in laboratory animal management and the humane care and use of laboratory animals. Assure that all staff coming into contact with research animals are protected through a current and comprehensive occupational health and safety policy. Provide a comprehensive, semi-annual review of the programmatic and physical infrastructure, including all locations which may be used to conduct VA animal research or house VA research animals. Review and approve Standard Operating Procedures for the animal research facility. Interpret and provide guidance to local research staff on any regulatory questions or concerns.   Respond to all animal research related concerns on a station level. Provide aid and assistance to the staff veterinarian, animal facility staff and Institutional Review Board (IRB) members on any animal or regulatory matter brought before the board, to include issues of potential mistreatment and protocol noncompliance. Provide reports and feedback to the hospital Director regarding the state of the program and any corrective measures needed to ensure quality and compliance. Both VA policy (found in Handbook 1200.7) and the AWAR and the PHS Policy describe specific authorities and responsibilities for the IACUC. VACO makes all efforts to monitor all elements of a stations research program.  Collectively however, these efforts have a weakness in that they only represent "snapshots" of IACUC function at points in time, and do not necessarily evaluate the ability of an IACUC to sustain a level of local monitoring and oversight needed to ensure a consistently high quality program.  Specifically, they do not allow VACO to evaluate the IACUC's ability to complete an entire monitoring "cycle" (identify problems, identify solutions and corrections, and ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of corrections) nor evaluate if the IACUC's documentation of business conducted at meetings and documentation available for specific projects is adequate. Such evaluations are difficult to perform without on-site evaluations.     Accordingly, the general scope of this contract is an evaluation of how consistently the IACUC meets the regulatory and functional responsibilities given it by VA policy and federal regulations.  Consistent with the concept of self-regulation, the IACUC must:  Review proposed uses of animals and ensure that such use is consistent with policies and regulations, and document the review in minutes and other documents to provide confidence that adequate review is being performed. Monitor ongoing animal research to ensure that studies are being conducted as approved, and document monitoring activities. Identify deviations from policy and regulation, document them, develop a corrective plan and timeline, and then monitor to ensure that corrective actions have been effective and timely. Communicate with both investigators and the medical center Director as needed to ensure transparency and foster an environment where self-regulation can be optimally effective. The task scope will be limited to a pilot project, which will review no fewer than five and no more than twelve IACUCs at the Medical Center level.   The final deliverable of this contract will be reports which address how well each IACUC is meeting the VA and other regulatory body requirements listed above. The overall goal is for the contractors to get a sense of: IACUC organization and general management Level of IACUC effectiveness in the review of investigator requests for use of animals in biomedical or rehabilitative research within the VA. Level of IACUC effectiveness in the management of new and on-going investigator requests for use of animals in biomedical or rehabilitative research within the VA. Level of IACUC effectiveness in monitoring the overall animal research program. Level of IACUC effectiveness in monitoring the animal research facility (both infrastructure and physical assets). Level of IACUC effectiveness in the identification of programmatic and facility deficiencies. Level of IACUC effectiveness in the formulation and execution of plans for corrective action toward identified deficiencies. Level of IACUC effectiveness in response to issues involving both the animal program, the users of the program or over-arching issues with biomedical research involving animals. Level of IACUC knowledge in current best practices and regulations involving animal programs. The contractor will be required to travel in support of this contract.  The final deliverable will be a report which identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis) and also identifies current organizational trends.  Intermediate deliverables will include individual post-site visit reports and regular updating of the proposed GNATT chart.  This contract will not exceed eighteen (18) months in length. Interested firms should provide company profile including qualification statement (i.e., Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veterans-Owned or Women-Owned Business, or if firms have a GSA Federal Supply Schedule).  The detailed qualifications statements from interested sources are to be submitted via email to Ms. Bridgett Baer at Baer.Bridgett@mail.va.gov by March 23, 2007.  Please reference RFI number VA-101-07-RI-0248.

Description
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Microelectronics Technology Office (MTO) will host an industry day on 26 March, 2007, at the System Planning Corporation, 3601 Wilson Blvd (also known as One Virginia Square) Suite 300, Arlington, VA. 

The purpose of the Industry Day is to familiarize industry with the TRUST in Integrated Circuits program and the open solicitation, BAA07-24, for innovative research proposals to advance science and technology for ensuring that integrated circuits (IC) can be trusted regardless of their origin and fabrication process. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  This program centers on the problems associated with ensuring IC hardware works as intended and ensuring the design and fabrication process can be trusted. DARPA is only interested in assessing the trustworthiness of individual ICs and is not interested in solutions that extend to the printed circuit board or that involve multiple ICs working together to ensure trusted processing.
Total program funding will be determined based on the technical merits of solicitations to meet stated performance objectives.  This Industry Day will discuss DARPA's interest in three specific areas 1) Hardware Validation, 2) Design Validation, and 3) System Integration. Specific metrics-based performance goals and a plan for the government to provide test articles that will be used for technical performance assessments and future Go/No-go decision milestones will be discussed at this briefing. 
Attendance at the Industry Day is not a prerequisite for submitting a proposal. However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions and answers. Seating at the Industry Day briefing is limited. Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per offeror with four (4) persons maximum per corporation; you may include up to two (2) alternates for the meeting. Badging and sign-in will begin at 0730 hours. The government briefing will begin at 0800 hours and conclude at 1300. Answers to questions will be verbally delivered during the meeting. Briefing materials and answers to questions will be posted after the meeting at http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations/baa07-24/index.html. 
It is requested that attendees register at https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=TRU54443 no later than Thursday, March 22, 2007. If you have any questions regarding registration for the industry day, please contact Jonathan Breedlove at Jonathan.Breedlove.ctr@DARPA.mil.  Please note that there is a $30.00 registration fee which will cover the cost of breakfast, coffee, and a working lunch.  Parking under the building is $12.00 and should be paid directly to the parking attendant.  This building is located next to the Virginia Square metro stop on the orange line.
Advanced questions pertaining to the program are encouraged and may be e-mailed to BAA07-24@darpa.mil so they can be addressed at Industry Day. We will not identify the group who submitted the question unless otherwise requested.  Groups that wish to be identified as responding to Area 3, System Integrators, should indicate that they wish to have this done at this meeting.  
This Industry Day is for informational purposes only. Participation is totally voluntary, and the Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information  Inherently Flame Retardant Materials or Flame Retardant Treated Materials for the Sniper Ghillie Suit Accessory Kit (GSAK), NSN 8415-01-394-7698
<DESC>The Clothing Team of the Warfighter Protection and Aerial Delivery Directorate at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in Natick, MA has a need to identify possible solutions to add Flame Retardant (FR) properties to the materials used in the construction of the currently fielded Snipers Ghillie Suit Ac cessory Kit (NSN 8415-01-394-7698) by means of inherently flame retardant fibers / materials or treatments to existing materials. The government is conducting a market investigation seeking product information, manufacturing capabilities and/or samples of inherently FR materials or FR treated materials, which are comparable in weight, durability, and use that is required by the Ghillie Suit Accessory Kit. The Ghillie Suit, without a set specification, is unique in that each individual sniper constructs thei r own from the base layer outward. Materials used in the construction of the Ghillie suit include jute and non-flame retardant materials. The use of jute and other materials are preferred in that they reflect the physical characteristics of natural environ ments (smell, appearance, etc). It is common that Ghillie suits are left outside for weeks at a time to endure natural decay and weathering so that it will better blend into surroundings. The new flame retardant materials will also have to reflect this tra it. The government will perform all physical and other required testing to determine the best performing material / solution available.  Companies may request testing results regarding only their own materials.  Results from this evaluation may be used to update the current military specification to include inherently FR materials to FR treated materials in the construction of the Ghillie suit.  When submitting U.S. contracts, offers are cautioned that their products (all materials and manufacturing) must c omply with Berry Amendment Restrictions (see DFARS 252.225-7012).  Products shall meet the following critical performance requirements:  (1) Flame retardant with a focus on durability, self extinguish upon removal of ignition source, no melt and drip. It i s also desired that this material be comparable to current Ghillie suit construction materials in performance, weight, and where possible, cost.  Interested firms are requested to submit information on their product within thirty (30) days following the pu blication of this synopsis.  Information should include, but is not limited to, product cost, technical information (e.g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM, AATCC, NFPA 701)), certification/compliance, relevant c ompany background/experience, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value of their product(s) and the ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  Companies are also encouraged to submit samples for evaluation.  Any info rmation/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such samples.  The testing results will be controlled and used for governmental purposes only.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Francisco Marti nez, Multifunctional Materials Team, ATTN: AMSRD-NSC-WS-TM, 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5019.  This notice is for market survey only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  No solicitation document exists.  The information received under this announce ment may in the future be used to update the current specification to include inherently FR materials or FR treated materials.   Point of Contact for this request is Francisco Martinez at (508) 233-5802, FAX (508) 233-4651 or email Francisco.Martinez8@us.army.mil.

				STATEMENT OF WORK
Purpose
In September 2006, FRA offered on-line ethics training to satisfy basic training requirements for all of its employees with a reminder that everyone is “expected to follow the ethics rules.”  While the on-line training is useful, it cannot provide the depth of understanding required to develop and reinforce a strong ethical foundation.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Inspector General (OIG), in its Top Management Challenges for 2007 stated, “DOT needs to continually promote and reinforce ethical standard through rigorous ethics awareness and training programs.”

Objective
The objective of this procurement is to obtain on-site training at a minimum of five conferences planned between June 2007 and September 2007.  Each of the Office of Safety’s technical disciplines is holding a conference designed around training and improving communications.  The conferences are already scheduled and our field personnel are planning to attend, the conferences are ideal venues to provide the in-depth ethics training directed by the OIG.

Task Statement
Training should address the rules of ethical conduct that all employees should know and follow.  All training sessions, with the exception of the final session in Washington, DC, will be conducted on site in Fort Worth, Texas.  This training should provide a sound foundation for an ethical workplace including identifying:

•	Ethical responsibilities in the workplace
•	Personal character and integrity
•	Truth and lies
•	Respect
•	Ethical decision-making
•	A fair and equitable workplace
•	A healthy, safe, drug-free workplace
•	Electronic communications
•	Conflicts of interest
•	Conflicts of time and resources
•	Understanding gifts and hospitality
•	Using government property and time
•	Enforcing and reinforcing standards

It is expected that each training session will be for one full day.

Delivery Schedule:
The Contractor shall conduct all training sessions on the dates specified below:

   "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

   "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

  (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b)(1). 

    (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTE:  THIS IS A RE-COMPETE.  THE PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT HAD AN INCORRECT CLASSIFICATION CODE.

SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Responses to Questions

1. Is there an incumbent or someone who has worked on this project previously - is this follow on work being performed by an incumbent? 

No incumbent or someone else has worked on this project previously. 

2. Why is the NAICS code 541511 when there are no requirements to understand programming or code at the syntax level?
 
No code review or a task that requires a review at the syntax level is required. This code is for a developer/technical person. Although there are technical aspects, a code for someone well versed in project/program evaluation would be more appropriate.

3. If performance is on-site, what are the implications of “provision of equipment”?

Contractor is required to have his/her equipment. 

4. Task 2: If the CDC Project Officer determines interviews, what controls their number and schedule to allow for completion within the time frames? Is CDC willing to limit these prior to or at time of award?

The Division of Integrated Surveillance Systems and Services (DISSS) will schedule the appropriate interviews and time to complete scheduled interviews. There will be no need to limit scope prior to or at time of award. 

5. Task 3: What is the format of the presentation of the findings (report and stand-up or report only)? The audiences described would normally receive two different types of reports – one technical and the other user based? Are there one or two?

One written report and oral presentation are required. 

6. Task 4: Is this a review of COTS and interfaces among existing systems for efficacy or replacement or both? Should we assume no review of symbolic code is expected (see discussion re: NAICS code)?

Yes, the review of COTS is for both efficacy and replacement. We will need clarification to what is meant by ‘symbolic’. As stated above, No code review or a task that requires a review at the syntax level is required.

The use, possession or sale of alcoholic beverages or controlled substance by Contractor personnel while on duty is strictly prohibited. The Contractor shall immediately remove any employee who uses, possesses, or sells alcohol while on duty, or is found to be improperly in possession of a controlled substance. Removal ofesigned to provide an effective method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in the contract. The Government is concerned with the quality of the services provided, and not with the method that the Contractor uses to provide these services. If performance of any required service is unsatisfactory as a result of the Contractor's actions or omissions, then the Government may reduce the contract payments to reflect the decreased value of the services received in accordance with the PRS and/or applicable FAR clauses.

3. Responsibility for Quality Control: The Contractor, not the Government, is responsible for quality control and management actions to meet the terms of the Contract. The Government performs quality assurance to monitor whether Contract standards are achieved.

a. Periodic Inspections by the COTR or designated Government Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE).
b. Validated Customer Complaints. (See Encl 1)

PERIODIC INSPECTIONS: This method is sometimes called "planned sampling." It consists of the evaluation of tasks selected on other than a 100 percent or random basis. This method will be used on those items identified as such in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).
Quarterly MADRs: The COTR or QAE will perform regular inspections on Vehicles in use on Government property in conjunction with normal pickup days, but the inspections will not interfere with normal collection operations. The COTR or QAE will conduct an inspection of at least one (1) trip per Quarter. The COTR or QAE will draw a number from 1 to 12 at the beginning of each Quarter to determine which weekly trip will be inspected under this method of sampling. Monthly MADRs: The COTR or QAE will conduct monthly inspections of at least (1) one performance objective per month. The COTR or QAE will draw a number from I to 4 at the beginning of each month to determine which week the inspections will take place.
 


ATTACHMENT 3 

VALIDATED CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS: Any base employee that observes unacceptable services, whether incomplete or not performed, for any performance objectives should immediately contact the COTR. The COTR will record the complaint including date and time, customer name, phone number and the nature of the complaint. The COTR will respond as soon as possible after receipt of a complaint to conduct a site visit to personally observe the reported defect. If the COTR determines the complaint is valid, the COTR will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint and notify the Contractor of the defect. The COTR should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COTR if not corrected. For purposes of calculating deductions, a validated customer complaint will be treated as if it had been identified as part of periodic inspections.

5. Deduction Methods: The Government will record all instances of substandard performance, whether through inspections, direct observation, customer complaint, or any other mechanism. The Government's preferred course of action will be discussions with the Contractor to make the Contractor aware of the problem, and to effectively prevent any recurrence of substandard performance. However, the Government may also take the following actions in addition to, or instead of, discussions with the Contractor: a. Presentation of a Contract Discrepancy Report requiring a written explanation for substandard performance;
b. Payment deductions in accordance with the PRS; and/or
c. Payment deductions in accordance with the applicable FAR clause(s).

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY 
Performance Based Deduction Formula
Performance Objective	PWS Para.	Weight	Maximum Allowable Defect Rate	Surveillance Method
Collect refuse in a timely manner	C.3.2	70%	1 Defect per month	
Dispose of refuse and in a timely manner	C.3.5	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Sanitize containers	C.3.3.1	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Maintain and replace contractor furnished containers as necessary	C.3.3.2	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Deduction Threshold. If the number of defects, or instances of unacceptable performance, observed during a month-long period is equal to or less than the maximum allowable defect rate (MADR), then there will be no deduction in payments to the Contractor for that task. However, if the number of defects observed during a month-long period is greater than the MADR, then there will be a deduction in payments to the Contractor for that task.

Example of Deduction Amount to Contractor Payments.

(a) The MADR for refuse collection and recycling is 1 defect per month based on the performance objective. A verified customer complaint regarding any maintenance work that falls below the standards set forth in the PWS will be considered a defect as will any inspected work that falls below the same standards. If one or more complaint is received regarding the same item this will only be considered one complaint. Upon notice of the defect(s) the contractor will be given 24 hours to correct prior to the taking of a deduction;
Page 1 of 2


 
(b) Assume that there is one verified customer complaint regarding untimely refuse collection during the month;
(c) One defect exceeds the MADR of zero, therefore, there will be a deduction in
the payment to the Contractor for this month;
(d) The deduction amount will be as follows:
(i)	Assume the maximum possible contract payment for items C.3.2. 1, C.3.5, C.3.3.1 and C.3.3.2 is $15,000 per month.
(ii)	Timely refuse collection is weighted at 85% of the monthly total payment, which equals $12,750.
(iii)	A deduction of 1 / 30 of $12,750 will be taken for every day the defect remains uncorrected, starting from the date the defect was first reported to the contractor.
(iv)	Therefore if the defect was reported to the contractor on July 1 and it was not corrected until July 6 this would equal five defective days. Thus the deduction would be 5 X 1/30 X $12,750 = $2,125
(v)	The Contractor will receive a monthly payment of $12,875 which is the maximum possible monthly payment of $15,000 minus the deduction amount of $2,125.
Surveillance Guide and Evaluation Procedure. The COTR will use an inspection checklist to evaluate Contractor performance. At the
end of each month, the COTR will summarize his or her findings, calculate the recommended deduction amount, if any, and forward
this recommendation to the Contracting Officer

<DESC>Question #1: Is there a requirement for special diffusion pump oil or a restriction for a type of oil, i.e.; silicone oil?

Answer: There is not a special requirement beyond those already listed in the technical specifications of the system:
	- Pump oil must be capable of maintaining a background pressure for the chamber of less than 2 x 10^-7 Torr.
	- Pump oil must be capable of handling a 15 Torr*Liter/sec of helium for extended periods of time without degrading the oil.
	- Pump oil must be compatible with whatever diffusion pump is selected. 

Question #2:  Is a PC required?

Answer:  If the PLC controller gives us complete monitoring/control/interlocking capabilities over the system (pumps, gauges/sensors, valves, etc), is reprogrammable, can be expanded to include additional components, and can be programmed to perform multi-step processes (like venting or pumping down the system) with the press of a single button? all without a ?PC,? then a touch screen PLC controller will satisfy our technical requirements.
