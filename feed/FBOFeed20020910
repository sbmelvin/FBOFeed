<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to modify, on a sole source basis, Contract HQ0006-01-C-0001 with The Boeing Company, to include concept development for a follow-on exo-atmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), the Complementary Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (CEKV). The CEKV is a multi-phased acquisition supporting both the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) and Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) programs. The CEKV will use the latest technology to provide improved Counter-Counter measure performance that: exploits all available information; incorporates new Active and Passive sensors technologies; introduces new fusion and discrimination algorithms; and balances load between on-board and off-board sensors and processors.  The effort necessary to satisfy the CEKV concept development is highly specialized and tightly interwoven with the on-going GMD system development efforts being provided by Boeing.  No other source can meet this requirement to provide the planned CEKV concept development effort without the intimate knowledge of, and subsequent ability to integrate the CEKV into the GMD system under this contract.

<CONTACT>Susie Zimmer Contracting Officer 2083785156 szimmer@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Set-Aside: This requirement is not set-aside for small business  concerns, and is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness  Demonstration Program.  The North American Industry Classification  System (NAICS) Code is 235990 and the size standard is $12 million.  The  Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a solicitation this winter (early  2003)  for rock bolting the left abutment downstream of Deadwood Dam.   The site is not accessible at the time offers will be solicited and  received, so we are conducting a site visit this fall so potential offerors  can inspect the left abutment work conditions, access in and out of the  site, living conditions needed on site, etc.  On site work is scheduled  for July 1 through October 1, 2003.  WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO  ATTEND THIS SITE VISIT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT  WHEN THE REQUIREMENT IS SOLICITED.   The major work consists of installing approximately 85 (tensioned) rock  bolts into the left abutment.  The drill holes will be up to 4-inches  in diameter and vary in length from 20 feet to 50 feet for a total  footage of about 3800 feet.  The rock bolts (high-strength number 11 bars)  will be grouted through the anchor length, tensioned, then grouted the  rest of the length.  Concrete bearing pads and/or steel bearing plates  will be required for tensioning. Some scaling of the rock slope will be  required before rock bolting begins.  Also, about 1000 cubic yards of  loose material will have to be excavated from the upper portion of the  left abutment and disposed of at a nearby site.  The left abutment is very steep (near vertical in places) and is  positioned above the stilling basin (Deadwood River).  Irrigation releases  will be made continuously throughout the summer.  Drill fluid and grout  will not be allowed to enter the river.  The abutment is approximately  140 feet high.  Access to the left abutment work area is limited.   Access will have to be from the dam crest or from the top of the abutment  down.  The attached photos show the left abutment area.  Time and Date of  Site Visit: September 24, 2002, at 7:00 a.m.  Place to Meet for Site  Visit: Meet in front of the Bureau of Reclamation Regional Office  Building at 1150 North Curtis Road, Boise, Idaho, to caravan to the dam site.   The drive to the site takes 2-½ to 3 hours.  Plan on returning to Boise  after 5:00 pm.  You will need to bring a lunch.  We will stop at a  grocery store on the way out of town for those who need lunch supplies.   (If it is more convenient for you to meet at the dam site, please notify  the contact person below).   Location of Project:  Deadwood Dam is located in a remote area about 55  air miles northeast of Boise, Idaho, and 90 road miles from the  Regional Office in Boise, Idaho.  We will travel to the dam site by taking  State Highway 55 north out of Boise, Idaho.  At Banks, we will turn east  on the Banks to Lowman road.  We will continue past Garden Valley about  13 miles and turn north on FR 555 (Scott Mountain Road).  The dam is  located 26 miles from the turnoff.  FR 555 is a windy, steep (grades up  to 13%), mostly one-lane, unpaved road that goes up over Scott Mountain  (summit elevation 7500 feet - the dam is at elevation 5300 feet).   A  high-clearance vehicle is recommended.  It takes about 1 hour to travel  the 26 miles along FR 555.  We should arrive at the dam site around  10:00 a.m.  There are two other routes into the dam site; however, both  routes are longer if you are traveling from Boise.  One route is to  continue east past the FR 555 turnoff until you reach Lowman, Idaho.  At  Lowman, leave the pavement and travel 31 miles on FR 582 to Bear Valley,  then travel 16 miles west on FR 579 (Landmark to Stanley road).   Continue south on FR 555 another 12 miles to the dam site.  The third route is  to continue north at Banks on State Highway 55 through the town of  Cascade, Idaho.  Just north of Cascade, travel east for 33 miles on FR 22,  past Warm Lake to the Landmark junction were the pavement ends.  Head  south on FR 579 another 18 miles where the road meets FR 555.  Continue  south on FR 555 another 12 miles to the dam site.  The route through  Cascade and Warm Lake is recommended for heavy equipment travel.  If  travel to the dam is over Scott Mountain (as described above), contractors  are urged to take this route when leaving the dam, so the condition of  both roads can be assessed. All routes are impassable from about  mid-October until about mid-June due to winter conditions.  Contact for  Additional Information: For more information on the site visit only, contact  Don Rosbaugh at (208) 334-1010.  Please notify Mr. Rosbaugh if you plan  on participating in the site visit.  Set-Aside: This requirement is not  set-aside for small business concerns, and is issued pursuant to the  Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The North American  Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 235990 and the size  standard is $12 million  Estimated Price Range of the Project: $500,000 to  $1,000,000.  Solicitation Availability: The solicitation for this  project will be a negotiated, best-value solicitation, that will consider at  a minimum, the offeror's experience and past performance related to  projects of similar difficulty.  Information pertaining to the  solicitation for this project will be advertised in the future on our website,  www.pn.usbr.gov/contracts/construction.

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Michael Delp of College Station, TX 77845, for determination of total cardiac and regional blood perfusion in young, adult and aged male Long Evans rats.  Dr. Delp is the only known source that has integrated all of the necessary techniques to obtain and measureall of the necessary physiological parameters to develop the physiologicaly-basedl models.  Having one source for all the necessary parameters eliminates the introduction of additional variables that might  confound comparisons across organs within the same rat.  This becomes important not only for cross organ comparisons but for the comparisons across age.  Additionally, removing the cross laboratory confounding variable increases our ability to compare the results across different strains/stocks of  rats.  While this contract is to measure volumes, flows and cardiac output in Long Evans rats, we intend that this data will be used to make comparisons of these measurements in F-344 and Sprague-Dawley rats that were made in the laboratory of Dr. Delp.  Objective:  The objective of this project is  development of a data set of accurate measurements of cardiac output and fractional tissue perfusion rates in male Long Evans rats.  Measurements are desired in:  1) Adult, Ad libitum-fed Long Evans rats as they are used to examine the effects of airborne toxicants on pattern-elicited visual-evoked  potentials and to assess other measures of neurotoxicity. 2)  Ad libitum-fed rats younger than those used for objective 1) (to be called young for the purposes of this document) and ad libitum-fed rats older than those used for objective 1) (to be called aged for the purposes of this document), so  that the influence of age on cardiac output and fractional blood  flow can be determined.    These data will  prove useful in examining toxicants in sensitive subpopulations, an emerging priority research area expected to increase in importance in coming years. Obtaining these values at the same  time as the adult values is cost-effective and increases our ability to make age-related comparisons.  The blood flow parameters  will be collected in awake, non-restrained animals by the microsphere technique (Delp et al., 1991; Delp et al, 1998).  Awake, non-restrained animals must be used as  total cardiac output and organ perfusion rates are influenced both by  restraint and by anesthesia. Specifically, the parameters of interest include the volume of  and blood flow to the organs of the body specified below and total cardiac output.  The rats in each treatment group will be surgically  implanted with catheters for the infusion of radiolabeled microspheres needed for the measurement of blood flow.  The following organs will be included in the analysis: skeletal and myocardial muscles, brain, splanchic, hepatic, reproductive and skeletal systems, fat, skin, kidneys and total  contributions from all organs. Scope of Work:  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS: TASK 1:   The contractor shall perform the necessary surgical and experimental procedures needed to determine total cardiac output and  regional blood flows for each age group.  TASK 2:   The contractor  shall obtain the radiolabeled microspheres (46Sc, 85Sr, 113Sn or 95Nb) needed for the blood flow measurements as well as the equipment and other materials needed for the determinations.  The U.S. EPA shall supply the animals needed to do the determinations.  TASK 3:   The contractor shall determine  the concentration of radiolabeled microspheres needed for the determinations.  These values could be available in the literature.  TASK 4:  The contractor shall conduct measurements on approximately 8-12 animals per period. Approximately equal numbers (within one) of animals shall be done from each  age group per year, dependent on the availability from the supplier of the young and old rats.  If rats of the appropriate age are available, a minimum of 2 rats shall be done from each age group per year.  At the end of the 3 twelve month project periods, there will be a minimum of 8 rats/age  group and a maximum of 12 rats/age group.  TASK 5:  The contractor shall provide interim reports at the end of each 12 month period that include summary statistics as well as individual animal data for the animals in which measurements were made during that period.   The report for the first,  second and third periods shall include, for the year covered, summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, n) as well as the individual animal data  from which the summary statistics were collected.  The report for the third period shall additionally include summary statistics for all the animals  of each age group that were measured over the course of the project and an appendix including the entire individual animal data set.  Contractor Requirements:  The contractor shall perform measurements, within each 12 month  period, on the number of animals specified per year.  The contractor shall  prepare and maintain any equipment and materials that are required for the measurement of total cardiac output and regional organ perfusion.  The contractor shall prepare annual reports summarizing the work completed during that year and a final report summarizing the complete project.  All  interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  No Solicitation is available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no  Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response no later than 25 September  2002 to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Joy  Kimble (MC-E105-02), RTP-POD (D143-01), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.  Technical questions may be submitted via email to kimble.joy@epa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a DNA Slide Scanner for use in the Center for Nanotechnology.  The government has identified only one source that can supply an instrument with all of the following minimum critical requirements: 1.  The system must have high-speed simultaneous dual-channel scanning that increases the acquisition speed (minimum 5-minute scan for two wavelengths at 10um resolution), eliminates the need for post-capture image registration, and reduces photobleaching.  Because of the simultaneous scanning, it is possible to view a complete ratio of values as the scan is progressing with real-time results.  Minimum sensitivity required is 0.1 fluor/um2.  These specifications are needed because a slower scanner could damage the sample. 2.  Non-confocal scanning technology with 64 um depth of field to provide accommodation for a variety of substrate media and optimal signal-to-noise ratio and field uniformity is required as it is necessary to use many slides of different thicknesses. 3.	 The instrument must have a self-correcting mechanism for faults during scanning.  The system must have a completely integrated hardware and software package that runs self-diagnosis of laser power and scanner performance, and ensures seamless communication and performance.	 4.  Scripting capabilities for generating customized reports and process automation are needed so the user can generate a log of each experimental variable. 5.      Dynamic photomultiplier adjustment capability that allows the user to optimize detector voltages is required because samples may have different total fluorescence and all samples must be standardized. 6.	 Auto-alignment of other scanner model images.  This feature allows use of third party slides. 7.	  Array list generator for identifying genes.  This feature allows user-friendly interface for data analysis. 8.  Integrated barcode reading.= =20 This very important feature allows bookkeeping of experiments. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the system, a GenePix 4000B Integrated Array Scanner, with three copies of GenePix Pro 4.0 Acquisition and Analysis Software, with Acuity 1.1 Microarray Informatics Software, from Axon Instruments, Inc. of Union City, CA. under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), only one source reasonably available.

<CONTACT>Deborah Bullard, Senior Subcontract Administrator, Phone 303-384-6876, Fax 303-384-6877, Email deborah_bullard@nrel.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTEREST FOR COMMERCIAL BIODIESEL PARTNERSHIPS FOR PUERTO RICO

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the U.S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) Office of Economic Development and Diversity and Office of Biomass Programs (formerly the Office of Fuels Development) want to promote commercial biodiesel production on the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is 100% dependent on imported petroleum to run all of its transportation, electricity, and industrial energy needs. The island is vulnerable to any supply or price shocks and occasionally, hurricanes.  Puerto Rico has a supply of biodiesel feedstocks in the form of used cooking oils and animal fats.  Its warm climate makes it uniquely suitable for using animal fat based biodiesel fuels.  Animal fat biodiesel has limited markets on the mainland due to cold weather concerns, but fats could be exported to Puerto Rico for biodiesel feedstocks to expand the Puerto Rican biodiesel industry.  A domestic biodiesel manufacturing facility could meet some of the island?s distillate needs while providing significant local air quality and health benefits to the islanders.  A production facility also offers employment and investment opportunities for Puerto Ricans.  There are several local policies that offer significant economic benefits for alternative energy producers.  A domestic biodiesel manufacturing facility is needed to jump start interest in biodiesel in Puerto Rico because its relative isolation from the remainder of the United States limits the free flow of information about the emerging biodiesel industry in the U.S.  Previous support from the DOE has developed local biodiesel demand, expertise, and political support for biodiesel. Two organizations that have had lead roles in the development are the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and Panzardi-ERM. DOE?s Puerto Rican partners have established local analytical capabilities, familiarity with biodiesel production technology, a small group of consumers, and tremendous support from local decision makers from government, energy, and environmental markets.  Several firms have expressed an interest in building biodiesel plants in Puerto Rico as a result of these efforts.

The objective of this project will be to establish a biodiesel production facility on the island. This project, through partnering with a commercial firm, or one lead firm in a consortium of organizations, that is committed to constructing and operating a biodiesel production facility on the island of Puerto Rico, is to promote economic development and energy security benefits. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will manage this project on the behalf of DOE.  Up to $200,000 of federal funds to leverage private investor resources is anticipated to be available.  Private cost share will be required as discussed below.  Firms will be expected to describe the tasks that utilize the federal funds as discussed below.

Qualified sources must meet the minimum requirements listed below.  Those that do not meet these minimum requirements will not be considered.

1)	Firms must be registered and licensed to do business in Puerto Rico. Proof of registration is required.  Partnerships with other organizations outside of this limitation are acceptable, so long as the lead organization is a commercial Puerto Rican company. Other firms may enter into partnerships for the purpose of this effort and subsequent commercial development of a biodiesel production facility, including, but not limited to, universities, not-for-profit firms, government agencies, non-U.S. companies, private investors not registered to do business in Puerto Rico, etc.  All partners will be required to provide letters of commitment to the lead firm.

2)	A minimum of 50% non-federal cost share.  Other local government resources (such as PRIDCO, Energy Affairs Office, etc.) may be available to leverage this project, and should be considered by the offerer.  Government funds from other federal, state, or local agencies will not be considered as private cost-share.  Costs that must be carried by private funds include the following:  Land purchases, Building purchases, Equipment purchases that exceed $10,000 per unit, License agreement or any purchase of rights for technology, Liability bonds and other insurance agreements, Hazardous waste removal.

3)	Firms must be capable of the following:  a) provide a communications plan for keeping all parties to the project informed of changes, accomplishments, decisions, and other material information as well as a process for identifying, airing, discussing and resolving disputes and changes, b)  provide a well-defined implementation/commercialization plan to include task activities and scheduling, key management staff and project team members along with their roles and responsibilities, equipment and supplies to be purchased, anticipated travel, deliverables and budget allocation, description of tasks that will utilize the federal funds.   Examples of possible tasks that the federal government is interested in cost-sharing are as follows: a) feasibility analysis and other proforma activities, b) engineering (PFDs, mass-energy balance, d) technology review and assessment, other), c) site evaluation and analysis, d) construction cost estimation and project economic analysis, e) permitting, f) activities that lead to financing commitments for the project, g) commercial shakedown (operating costs), H) site preparation costs (no hazardous waste removal), I) construction labor, j) equipment purchases less than $10,000 per unit, and, k) pilot scale facilities.

Parties interested in receiving the Request for Proposal for the above-described effort must respond by September 20, 2002 to the following:

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Mr. Xiangrong Hong of Toronto, Canada for the expansion and enhancement of the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) Thermodynamics Tables and SOURCE data system at NIST.  There will be a base year and one option year for this contract.  General skills involve computer programming and database design and management skills combined with extensive experience in chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and  chemical engineering.  Specialized skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC database systems and, in particular, TRC SOURCE and TRC Thermodynamic Tables-Hydrocarbons and TRC Thermodynamic Tables-Non-Hydrocarbons. TRC Thermodynamic Tables-Hydrocarbons and TRC Thermodynamic Tables-Non-Hydrocarbons represent hard-copy publications of the critically evaluated thermophysical and thermochemical property data for various classes of organic compounds. These publications are supported and maintained by the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division.  SOURCE is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by the TRC to store ?raw' experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions.  SOURCE is also used as a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms.  This work is targeting further development of  both products.  Mr. Hong has been involved in the development and production of the TRC Thermodynamic Tables since 1993 and has previously participated in the development of a number of software products which have been used to enhance the existing TRC products. He has prepared a great variety of the batch data entry files which were successfully loaded into the SOURCE data system.  Progress in the preparation of the Thermodynamic Tables-Hydrocarbons and TRC Thermodynamic Tables-Non-Hydrocarbons and development of SOURCE data system has its immediate impact into development and timely completion of a variety of other databases as well as hard-copy data products scheduled for release by the TRC. Any lapse in the quality, continuity, and schedules for TRC data products would be severely detrimental to NIST and to the users of this information.  This notice is for information purposes only.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neurophysiological Pharmacology Section (NPS) plans to procure from Plexon Inc., 6500 Greensville Ave., Suite 730, Dallas, TX 75206, a 16 Channel Multichannel Acquisition Processor (MAP) system. The NPS is investigating the role of specific neurotransmitters in regulating neuronal activity in extra pyramidal systems.  The current focus is on the mechanisms underlying the ability of dopamine-containing neurons to maintain appropriate functional output from the basal ganglia.  The NPS currently has a Government owned Plexon system that was purchased in 1999.  A second Plexon system is now required so two researchers can run simultaneous studies and pool the data obtained.  This can be done only if the hardware and software are compatible with the existing system.  The system required must:  1) record simultaneously from up to 16 electrodes chronically implanted in different areas of the brain of an awake behaving rodent;  2)  record single unit neuronal activity which is amplified and differentially recorded through 16 differential amplifiers;  3) process and monitor the data through software that makes it possible to selectively adjust the amplification and record from each of the electrodes independently; and  4)  selectively save data representing waveform and timing of the action potentials and subsequently to perform cross correlations on spike trains from all the different pairs of neurons recorded. This equipment is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 16, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute proposes to enter into a sole source purchase order with Phoenix Imperative Inc., of Frederick, MD 21704, to perform a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance audit of the NCI-SAIC Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP) at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center (FCRDC).  The NCI Biological Resources Branch (BRB) is supported by the BDP who provides research, development and cGMP production of biologics for cancer treatment and other diseases.  BRP is responsible for the oversight of the BDP, including ensuring that the facility and its programs remain in compliance with the Food and Drug Administration?s regulations governing such programs.  These compliance audits fulfill regulatory obligations to determine the laboratory?s level of compliance with Federal regulations and cGMP and satisfies, in part, BRP?s oversight responsibility.  Phoenix Imperative Inc. (PII) has reviewed the BDP on two separate occasions, October 1999 and April 2000.  They have made several recommendations and suggestions for improvement of the BDP functions and it is essential to have an assessment of the present status of the BDP with specific comparison to those previous findings.  In addition, due to their previous involvement and reviews with the BDP, PII has gained an excellent base of knowledge of the programs and research of BDP and BRP which will facilitate a quick and efficient review of the program.  The final report for the audit will be required NLT 3 weeks after issuance of the order.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  An original and one copy of the Capability Statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 19, 2002. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendors  responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Request for Construction Documents 
Solicitation _____________________

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.


REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:
Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local
jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.
2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description:
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
?Y Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
?Y Production throughput/capacity
?Y Environmental considerations
?Y Worker safety and health considerations
?Y Hazardous abatement considerations
?Y Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offerors may submit multiple and alternate proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #001  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Question: The NEXCom HiServer318-DC-SM/HDB31650 has three processor possibilities: Pentium III Tualatin 1.13GHz, Celeron 1.2GHz, and Pentium III 800MHz.  The specification calls for a Pentium III 1.2GHz, which is not an available processor option.  What is the correct processor type and speed?

Answer: Pentium III Tualatin 1.13GHz.

Question: We would like to use compaq as a vender for this RFQ however to meet the 1 rack need of your customer would mean we would have to use a processor Of 800Mhz is that ok? Or is the processor speed more important? If so then our solution with compaq would require 4 racks - please let me know if there is anything we can do?

Answer:  Compaq solution uses 1 hard disk across the nodes. This solution is unacceptable, we need each node to have its own individual hard drive.

Question: Per the synopsis, is it a requirement to submit technology samples on 9/13.

Answer: Yes, per announcement all bid samples and literature should be received by closing date as identified in the announcement.

Question: Is there a way to receive technical input back from your users?  

Answer:  All questions must come through the Contracting Officer.  Technical responses will be provided by the technical representative through the Contracting Officer. 

Question:  From a technical perspective, this solicitation is requesting technology based on the "compatPCI bus" Typically in a cluster environment this "bus" can become overly saturated causing performance degradation.  Have your users tested this, and would they consider alternative standard clusters with more advanced backend communications and switching like Dolphin, Myrinet, etc??  
 
Answer: The node computers should not all ride on the same pci bus but rather be complete computers nodes sending keyboard video, mouse, cdrom, and floppy connections to a backplane within the chassis.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to vendor questions received to date, make administrative changes and update the FAR clauses as follows.  QUESTION. Can I bid on certain elements of the project (i.e Project Manager or Assistant Project Manager role)?  ANSWER. You can cross reference from the categories identified in the synopsis notice to categories that your company currently has.  In the technical proposal, identify how you will utilize the proposed categories to perform the types of services outlined in the Statement of Work.  QUESTION.  Is there a specific format to be used when proposing on the project?  ANSWER.  You need to follow the Federal Acquisition Regulations, FAR Part 12 for Commercial Items (i.e., include a price for each CLIN, address the technical factors and include the Representations and Certifications).  QUESTION.  Is an RFP available for review?   ANSWER.  No.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  QUESTION.  Are there documented roles & responsibilities for each level of the project? ANSWER.  Not at this time.  QUESTION.  If this opportunity is no longer available, what other avenues may I pursue to identify additional opportunities within your agency?  ANSWER.  In Suite 1145 we have a bid board where solicitations between $10,000 and $25,000 are posted for competition.  You can also monitor the FedBizOps.  QUESTION.  Is this a new opportunity for the DLA?  In other words, is there an incumbent contractor already doing this work for DLA that would be allowed to re-compete for the work?  ANSWER.  This is a new statement of work as written.  In the past we used Government Impac Card, Purchase Orders, etc. to accomplish the individual tasks.  QUESTION.  Is there a preferred contracting vehicle?  (i.e., GSA, or some other GWAC, IDIQ)  ANSWER.  Any type of vehicle can be proposed.  We are looking for the best services at the best price.  QUESTION.  Can you please tell us how you want to price this proposal?  Because we don't know the frequency/scope of these events, will our labor categories and rates suffice?  Also, is this a T&M or CPFF contract?  ANSWER.  The CLINs specified in the announcement are NOT TO EXCEED number of hours.  Anticipate T&M type proposal for labor hours and cost for travel.  If you utilize your own labor categories, please cross reference to the solicitation categories.  Clarification.  The technical evaluation factors are in descending order of importance.  The storage area for event supplies is the responsibility of the Contractor with full liability of the contents during the duration of the contract.  Correction.  The contractor will also maintain Public Liability Insurance in the amount of $100,000.00, or the amount currently required by the State or this Contracting Office.  Additional FAR Clauses 52.216-18 Ordering (Oct 1995) Orders may be issued from the date of award (exercise of option) through one year thereafter.; 52.216-19 Order Limitations (Oct 1995) Minimum Order amount is $2500, Maximum Order - The contractor is not obligated to honor any order for a single item in excess of the total contract amount, any order for a combination of items in excess of the total contract amount or a series of orders from the same ordering office within seven days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation previously stated, and 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity (Oct 1995) (Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after the individual order is completed.  Please contact Ms. Brenda Geist (brenda_geist@hq.dla.mil) for ALL QUESTIONS and information regarding the solicitation.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission invites industry review and comments on the draft statement of work to efficiently operate and maintain a computer-assisted system to receive, process, and disseminate all information relating to the Lost and Stolen Securities Program.

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information is to:

1.Request ideas from industry on how to improve the operation and
efficiency of the existing system. 2. Request ideas on how to change/update the fee structure. 3. Obtain industry interest in the program. 4.	Gather information to assist the SEC in updating system specifications.  The government is open to alternative concepts.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to provide improvements/enhancements to the Lost and Stolen Securities Program, including its database, reports, inquiries and fee structure. 1.0	Background: On August 5, 1977, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") announced the implementation of the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (the "Program") under Section 17(f)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   and Rule l7f-1 (17 CFR 240.17f-1) there under.  The purpose of the Program is to reduce the trafficking in illicit securities by making available to brokers, dealers, and federally-insured banks, among others, information that identifies missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit securities.  To implement Rule 17f-1, the Commission determined that a computer-assisted system should 
be used and that a non-Government entity should receive, process, and disseminate all information relating to the Program.  As of December 31, 2001, the Program's database contained data on approximately 26 million certificates reported as lost, stolen, 
missing, or counterfeit, and 25,296 reporting institutions were 
registered in the Program.  During 2001, reporting institutions 
reported as lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit 2,954,692 
certificates.  Those reporting institutions also reported the recovery of 218,744 certificates previously reported during 2001 as lost, stolen, missing or counterfeit. 2.0 Draft Statement of Work - The Contractor shall (1) design, develop, test, implement, operate, and maintain the software for a computerized database of the missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit securities; (2)  process missing, lost, stolen, recovery, and counterfeit reports from reporting institutions and add the information contained on the missing, lost, stolen, and counterfeit reports (e.g., the reporting institution's Financial Industry Number Standard ("FINS number"), the certificate's CUSIP number, certificate number, etc.) to the database or match up each recovery report with the 
appropriate lost, stolen or counterfeit report in the database filed by the same reporting institution that filed the recovery report and delete the reported information from the database  ; and (3)  process inquiries from reporting institutions concerning the data captured and stored in the database. The operational process involves two basic functions: reporting and inquiring.  First, under the Program all reporting institutions (brokers, dealers, federally insured banks, and registered transfer agents, among others) must report missing, lost, stolen, counterfeit, 
and recovered securities to the contractor in a standardized format using Form X-17F-1A.   Pertinent information contained in each report is entered by the Contractor into a computerized, cumulative database.  Second, reporting institutions must inquire of the Contractor to determine if certain securities certificates being presented to them have been reported as missing, lost, stolen or counterfeited.  The Contractor operates and maintains the database, processes reports, and responds to inquiries.  
3.0	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - Although the Contractor may choose its own particular mix of manual and computerized functions, the electronic database must accommodate certain minimum information identified on Form X-17F-1A (e. g., the 
Financial Industry Number Standard ("FINS number") of the reporting institution, the certificate?s CUSIP number,  its certificate number, and the number of shares of an equity security or the face value of a debt security) on all certificates reported as lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit.   The Contractor shall have the capability to "flag" a particular CUSIP number or a subset of a particular CUSIP number (e.g., by issuance date(s) or within a range of certificate numbers). A flag only indicates a potential match but it may become an actual match if, for example, the securities certificate being inquired about has been cancelled on the books of the issuer (meaning that the lost, missing, or stolen certificate is worthless).  The system must accommodate all reporting institutions, which are 
required to register as either direct or indirect inquirers under Rule 17f-1.  A direct inquirer is a reporting institution that inquirers of the contractor directly, i.e., by computer terminal, telephone or by other means (as distinct from indirect inquirers who inquire only through direct inquirers). As of December 31, 2001, there were 25,926 reporting institutions registered in the  Program [consisting of 1,693 direct inquirers and 24,233 indirect inquirers].  The Contractor shall have the facilities and capacity to process inquiries and reports from several different types of communications: 1. Host-to-host communication, 2. PC dial-up communication, 3. Interactive telephonic communication, 
4. Facsimile machine communication, 5. Mail communication, 6. Other. The Contractor shall furnish adequate telephone  coverage to provide electronic hook-up for host-to-host communications and PC dial-up communications within a maximum of thirty (30) seconds after the call is placed. The Contractor must provide direct inquirers access to PC dial-up communications during regular business hours. The Contractor shall provide adequate telephone coverage to respond to an interactive telephonic communication with an electronic response indicating that the caller has reached the system, within a maximum of thirty (30) seconds after the caller places the call and to provide the caller with a live operator to respond to the caller's inquiry within a maximum of two (2) minutes. The Contractor shall be open for operation from at least 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on any day a registered national securities exchange is open for business.
The Contractor shall provide a system to accommodate the existing
database and allow for additional storage space to accommodate all additional data gathered over the life of the contract. The Program's database and all forms, files, and other information associated with the Program are the property of the Commission.  Thus the Contractor is prohibited from using such information in any manner other then to operate this Program.  Based on current operations, the system to be offered must accommodate at least thirty-four (34) gigabytes of on-line disk storage and allow 
for an approximate growth rate of thirty percent (30%) annually.
Additionally, the system must provide for off-line data storage for archived materials (e.g., reports and confirmations) of the database and must maintain adequate storage space to accommodate additional off-line and on-line data, forms, files, and other information associated with the Program gathered over the  term of the anticipated contract (base year plus four one year options). 4.0 TECHNICAL - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE - The computer language currently being used by the current contractor is 
C.  The successor Contractor, however, is not required to use the 
computer language of the current Contractor as long as the existing database can be transferred into the new computer system.
5.0 FEES - The Contractor shall perform all tasks associated with this contract at no cost to the Commission or the U.S. Government.  In order to maintain a no cost environment, the Contractor will be compensated for its service by directly  charging direct inquirers.  These fees received by the Contractor shall cover the entire cost of operating and maintaining the system.  This solicitation does not include any Government 
furnished equipment, installation or training.  The Contractor must set a fee for each service that it will provide.  In setting the fees, the Contractor shall develop its fee structure 
giving consideration to the size and classification of the various inquirers and ensuring that the fees do not discourage the use of the program.  Currently, inquirers are divided into three (3) classifications: banks, securities organizations, and non-bank transfer agents. Further, within each classification these organizations are divided into sub-classes according to their size.  Fees are to be fair and reasonable, and the fees shall be part of the contract.  The fee schedule shall cover all Contractor costs; i.e., facilities, equipment, equipment maintenance, installation, training, labor, labor overhead, 
G&A, profit.  The current fee structure generates income from six categories: registration fees, volume fees, indirect inquirer file maintenance fees, prompt written confirmation service fees, direct port access fees, and computer to computer (host-to-host communications) inquiry fees.  All fees are currently charged to direct inquirers on a semi annual basis.  6.0	FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS - The Contractor shall have the financial resources to meet the contract's start up costs and the ongoing costs and the other contingent costs and operating losses that may arise due to fluctuations in usage, inability to collect fees, inadequacies in its fee structure, or losses due to other causes (e.g., obligations relating to the Contractor?s own contractual liabilities or lawsuits involving negligence or other misconduct on the part of the Contractor).  The importance of this contract to the public interest requires such precautions.  7.0	PHYSICAL SECURITY - The Contractor shall be responsible for restricting access to operational areas (e.g., through use of alarm systems, access controls, etc.) and for providing environmental safeguards to protect operations from manmade or natural catastrophes (e.g., fire, flood, etc.).  The Contractor shall store at least one copy of all reports and inquiries (whether maintained on premises or preferably at off-site storage) in locked, fireproof cabinets located in a restricted access area for the life of the contract and shall turn over such records to the successor contractor.  The Contractor shall state specifically the medium on which it will keep the copies of all reports and inquiries.  DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with 
FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  
Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

<DESC>This is a request for Capability Statements from industry to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in FY03 studies/Technical Requirements Documentation (TRD) and subsequent future development of a Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) System.  This message is a follow-up to the SBSS Industry Day, which was advertised in the FedBizOps on 12 July 2002.  The government and TRW conducted this Industry Day on 5 August 2002.  Contractors that were unable to attend the industry day may contact Mr. Vanderpoorten (see below) to obtain the briefing charts.  

In April 1996, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) was launched to demonstrate Space-Based Space Surveillance Operations (SBSSO).  The SBSSO sensor, the Space Based Visible (SBV) telescope, is the last surviving sensor on the Mid-course Space experiment (MSX) and reaches its predicted end of life in FY05.  A follow-on capability is needed to meet Space Control requirements for significantly improved detection and timeliness of high interest space event reports.  SBSS is the next-generation family of these systems to search for, detect, and track objects in near earth and deep space orbits. 

In order to facilitate FY03 acquisition activities and establish an SBSS Stakeholder's Group (a forum to solicit TRD and Request for Proposal comments), interested companies shall submit two (2) copies of their Capability Statements no later than 4:00 p.m. PDT, 2 October 2002 to the following address:  TRW, Attn: Mr Joe Vanderpoorten, One Space Park (R2/1120), Redondo Beach, CA 90278.  The response should overview corporate core competencies, detail abilities to acquire, integrate, deploy and support advanced space and ground systems with legacy surveillance command and control capabilities.  Responses must be unclassified and not exceed 10, one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages (1 inch margins at top, bottom, and sides), with no smaller than 10-point arial fonts.  Please direct any questions or comments of a contractual nature to SMC/ADK, Capt Garth Arevalo by telephone at (310) 416-1571, or by email: garth.arevalo@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement:  UV-curable Intaglio Ink

The Bureau is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating samples of ultraviolet (UV) radiation curable inks for use in intaglio printing of U.S. securities.  Samples submitted for consideration will be evaluated for ease of use and compatibility with commercially available ultraviolet curing technology to be implemented at the Bureau.  Compatibility with the Bureau?s existing production process, environmental and safety requirements, and for durability of the cured ink is also required. 

In particular, the desired UV-curable ink must be compatible with the Bureau?s current intaglio printing process, which produces thick coatings from a mixture of shallow and deep engravings from an engraved plate.  The Bureau?s intaglio process is a cylinder-wipe process, where the cylinder is wiped with an alkaline aqueous surfactant solution.  The UV-curable ink must have physical characteristics similar to the intaglio inks currently in use at the Bureau to assure compatibility with the existing printing process and equipment.  The subject inks will be heavily pigmented, and generally black or dark green in color.  The inks must cure adequately with commercially available ultraviolet curing equipment at full-production speeds on the Bureau?s existing press equipment.  The surface-cure of the ink must be fast, preferably instantaneous, at full-production speed on the presses, such that no additional drying or cure time is required before the next step in the currency production process.  The ink must also achieve sufficient through-cure in the process to meet the durability requirement for the ink after printing.  The subsequent step in the production process may be another intaglio printing process or machine inspection.  The ink will be printed directly onto security paper comprised of cotton/linen fibers, or onto security paper previously printed with an ink in an offset press.  Ink samples may also be evaluated on non-traditional organic polymer substrates.  Printed ink samples must have a satisfactory level of cure and emit no effluent after cure.  Printed ink samples must also be color stable, highly durable to mechanical abrasion or other wear, and be resistant to chemicals and detergents. 

For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples, including Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and a brief technical description including cost information for the possible future purchase of larger test quantities to:

Humphrey, (256)-895-1133, Contract Specialist or Donna L. Bliss, (256)-895-1241, Contracting Officer.  Description:  The U. S. Army Engineering & Support Center, Huntsville, intends to m odify the current contract by increasing the ordering capacity by $10,000,000.00 to provide facility repair and rehabilitation at various facilities throughout the United States.  The services to be provided under this modification will remain consistent w ith the Scope of Work and nature of the original statement of work for the Contract (DACA87-97-D-0051).  The existing contract was awarded under full and open competition and provided for the issuance of firm-fixed price and time and material task orders.  The current contract ceiling was based upon our projections for customer requirements at the time.  It is now clear that the potential magnitude of programmatic support was far greater than our projections at the time of contract planning and award.  Ther e is no way this office could have foreseen the drastic increase in requirements that have occurred in the current year.  The increase in contract value is based on the unforeseen volume of project requests that have been realized up to this point of the c ontract life.  This office is currently involved in the evaluation phase to award replacement contracts.  The acquisition strategy for the programmatic support contracts will provide multiple award ID/IQ contracts to cover five years.       However, for this specific request, the unique, prior experience and involvement of the      current contractor, the need for facility repairs and renovations, and the requirement for  modification of existing task orders, the authority 10 U.S.C. 230 4(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) is applicable:  Only one reasonable source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements when supplies or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of production of a major system or highly specialized equipment and award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplication of cost to the Governm ent that is not expected to be recovered through competition or (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement. Due to the unique, prior experience and involvement of the current contractor, the need for facility repairs and renovations and the requirement for modification of existing task orders, the sole source award (modification to increase the ordering capacity ) to Noresco LLC is justified because to do otherwise would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays. This notice is not a formal solicitation.  The synopsis of intent to award a sole source is not a request for proposal (RFP).  The Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  Offerors who can demonstrate the necessary experience and expertise and who can provide the U. S.

Statement of Work
Mapping the Benthic Habitats within the York River, VA 

The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) and the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) are working together to map benthic habitats within the NERR and adjacent areas of the York River, VA.  This work is part of a larger effort by NOAA to develop spatial data for key elements of the research reserve system.  To map benthic habitats within the Chesapeake Bay NERR, CSC and the Reserve will use a combination of techniques, including traditional benthic sampling, sediment profiling imagery (SPI), multibeam acoustics, and a high-resolution video sled.  This array of sampling gears will allow the Center and the NERR to examine the synergies of sampling at multiple spatial scales and collecting data on different aspects of the benthic community in order to make recommendations to the research reserve system on optimum sampling strategies.

The purpose of this SOW is to obtain from a contractor:
?	All equipment, supplies, and crewmembers needed to accomplish the field portion of the study;
?	All sample and data processing needed to prepare benthic habitat maps that fully integrate the data;
?	A detailed report that assesses the unique elements and overlaps of each data stream as compared to each other to past studies of the York River and adjacent portions of Chesapeake Bay.

The Chesapeake Bay NERR will provide the research vessel for this study and the captain and crew needed to operate the research vessel.  Sampling will occur between September 30 and December 31, 2002.  The exact date will be subject to the availability of the research vessel.  The contractor shall be prepared to mobilize equipment, supplies, and crew at any time during this period.

The exact sampling plan that will be used is dependent upon the technical specifications of the equipment that is used, which will not be final until a contract is in place.  Therefore, only a general description of the plan can be given and upper limits set on the amount of data collected.  Contractors should use limits to gage the level of effort need to fully process the samples and data stream into stand-alone products and then into integrated maps of the benthic habitats within and adjacent to the NERR.



			
Sediment Profile Imagery
Sediment profile imagery shall be collected from up to 200 stations.  The contractor shall provide the camera and all equipment (e.g., frame and weights) and supplies needed to operate and maintain the profiling camera.  This shall include providing a portable davit and electric winch that can be used for deploying the camera should the davit onboard the vessel prove unable to handle the SPI camera at the required station-production rate.  The contractor also shall ensure sufficient electrical power is available onboard the vessel for operating the SPI camera.  The contractor also shall provide a crewmember that will be onboard the research vessel to operate the camera, monitor camera performance, diagnose all problems with camera operation, and make all needed adjustments and repairs to the camera during the fieldwork.  This crewmember shall maintain a log that records station identification and other information to unambiguously determine how photographs relate to station coordinates.  

The contractor shall process the film, mount all slides, and use the field log to label the station, drop, and photograph number of each slide.  If digital images are collected rather than 35 mm slides, the contractor will name each image to distinguish station, drop, and photograph number.   The contractor shall analyze the SPI photographs visually and electronically according to methods described in Diaz (1995) (Diaz, Robert.  1995.  "Benthic habitat classification of selected areas of Narragansett Bay, RI."  Final Report to the US Army Corps of Engineers, New England Division).  The contractor shall use best professional judgment to select the best photograph from each station and do a visual analysis of that photograph that includes, at a minimum, the following parameters:  

1.	The station, photo number and time-of-day identifiers;
2.	Sediment type;
3.	Descriptions of the physical features of the sediment surface;
4.	Descriptions of the biological features of the sediment surface;
5.	Enumeration and descriptions of any infauna present;
6	Enumeration and descriptions of any epifauna present;
7.	Enumeration and descriptions of voids present below the surface;
8.	Biological Habitat Quality as measured by Nilsson and Rosenberg, 1997 (Benthic Habitat Quality Assessment of an Oxygen Stressed Fjord by Surface and Sediment Profile Images." Journal of Marine Systems. Volume 11. Pages 249 to 264.)

The contractor shall use best professional judgment to select one representative image from each station and perform a computer-assisted analysis that includes, at a minimum, the following parameters:  

1.	Measurement of the minimum, maximum, and mean depths of the apparent redox potential discontinuity;
2.	Measurement of the minimum, maximum, and mean penetration depths of the SPI camera;
3.	Measurements of the surface area of any gas or feeding voids present.

The deliverables for the processing of the SPI imagery shall be:
?	all slides (labeled and mounted) or digital images;
?	a copy of the electronic images used for the computer-assisted image analyses, if not included in the above;
?	a QA/QC report describing how error checks were made and consistency in reporting was maintained;
?	the field log;
?	an Excel spreadsheet (or similar file approved in writing by the COTR) that for each photograph lists the above parameters as well as notes about image quality and accuracy of interpretation.

Benthic Grabs
Benthic grabs shall be collected from up to 50 stations.  The contractor shall provide a standard Young grab (or similar device approved in writing by the COTR) for the benthic sampling and perform the laboratory analyses of sediment texture and benthic community analysis.  Two grabs will be collected at each grab station.  Samples for benthic community analyses will be processed in the field by gently washing the samples through a 0.5-mm sieve and preserving the organisms and remaining debris in buffered formaldehyde.  The contractor shall provide all materials needed to process the benthic grabs in the field and for transporting the samples to the laboratory.  Samples for sediment texture and organic content shall be mixed and two sub-samples (each sub-sample consisted of 100 to 200 grams of sediment) collected and stored in sealed Whirl-Pak bags and packed in ice until they can be placed in a freezer.

Samples for sediment texture shall be kept frozen until ready for processing.  Sediment texture shall be analyzed according to standard geological procedures.  The deliverable for the sediment texture samples shall be a report that, at a minimum, lists for each sample:

1.  Folk Scale Description
2.  USACE Scale Description
3.  Percent Gravel
4.  Percent Sand
5.  Percent Silt
6.  Percent Clay
7.  Inman's Median Phi
8.  Folk's Mean Phi
9.  Folk's Standard Deviation Phi
10.  Folk's Skewness
11.  Folk's Kurtosis

Samples for sediment organic content will be processed by the Center or by NERR staff and will not be the responsibility of the contractor after the contractor delivers the samples to the on-site staff from the Chesapeake Bay NERR upon the termination of each day's field work.

Samples for benthic community analyses shall be processed in the laboratory by: 
?	emptying the entire contents of the sample containers or bags onto a 0.5-mm sieve and wash away residual formalin; 
?	placing the animals and debris into a 1-liter bottle and stain with Rose Bengal;
?	rewashing the sample over a 0.5-mm sieve;
?	removing all animals from the debris and placing them into labeled vials;
?	by sample, identifying and enumerating the animals.

Biomass shall be measured as wet weight, dry weight, and ash-free dry weight.  Samples from which archive specimens are removed, which shall only be done for taxonomic purposes, shall be listed along with the specimens removed for the archive.  Taxonomic groupings for biomass shall be: Porifera, Cnidaria, Polychaeta, other Anneilda, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, other Mollusca, Amphipoda, Isopoda, Ostracoda, Tanaideaca, Mysidacea, Reptant Decapoda, Natant Decapoda, other Crustacea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, other Echinodermata, Phoronida, Urochordata, and Miscellaneous.

The deliverables for the benthic community analyses shall be:
?	an Excel spreadsheet (or similar file approved in writing by the COTR) that lists for each station all taxa found, the number of individuals from each taxon, and either the NOAA or contractor-developed species-identification codes;
?	an Excel spreadsheet (or similar file approved in writing by the COTR) that lists for each station the biomass for each taxonomic group;
?	a report that describes processing methods and results of the QA/QC checks and lists the taxonomic authorities used for identifying the organisms.

Multibeam Bathymetry and High-Resolution Video Sled.
Multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution videography shall be collected along continuous transects to provide cm-scale coverage and estimates of rates of meter-scale spatial change.  Multibeam spatial positional accuracy shall be within a few meters for optimal discrimination of habitat variability and for integration with the sediment profile imagery and grab data.  High-resolution video (mm-scale) is needed to ground-truth the acoustic data and to resolve the nature of physical and biological processes structuring the bottom.  The contractor shall provide all acoustic, video, and computer equipment needed to collect and analyze these data.

Depths within the area to be sampled vary from intertidal (1 to 2 meters) to 25 meters.  The variety of habitats, sediment types, and water column conditions will be high. They will range from tidal freshwater clays and silts with detritus and gas to oligohaline, uncompacted silt deposits bounded by sandy shoals with relict oyster reefs to mesohaline deep silty-clay bottom channels bounded by shoals of various composition known to support several fisheries.  The survey area includes the submerged habitats within the Chesapeake Bay NERR and is approximately 5 square kilometers.

The deliverables for the multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution videography are:
?	GIS data for use with ArcView software that integrates both the broad-scale (multibeam) and small-scale (video) information and describes both physical and biological habitat characteristics;
?	FGDC-compliant metadata for all GIS data.

Technical Report
The contractor shall prepare a report that fully describes the results of the survey and recommends mapping strategies that can be used by the research reserve system and other groups for mapping benthic habitats within estuaries.  The report shall characterize the benthic habitats in the survey area, discuss the physical and biological processes influencing their occurrence and distribution, and discuss the relevance of these habitats in a coastal management context.  This report shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or WordPerfect format.

The contractor shall submit a proposal of not more than 5 pages in length that includes qualifications of the principle investigator and key personnel and a cost estimate for fulfilling the requirements of this Statement of Work.

All deliverables from this project shall be submitted in draft and final versions to the NOAA Coastal Services Center by June 30, 2003 and August 31, 2003, respectively.  The technical point of contact for this work is Linda Iocco, Linda.Iocco@noaa.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-27 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20001213.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,000) will be followed.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3679.  Small business size standard is 500.  NAICS is 334419.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside. 
The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking sources for the anticipated purchase of the following two items.  
*Item (1), Ten (10) Integrated Microwave Attenuator, Phase Shifter Assemblies to be used with simulator systems.  Salient characteristics include:  Frequency range 2-6 and 6-18 GHz, 5 MMIC Amplifiers, 1 I-Q Vector Modulator, 1, 64 dB digitally controlled attenuator, 2, low pass filters, 2, SP2T Switches, 1, temperature compensation network, high accuracy features between <0.1 dB and <1.0degree, switching speed of <500 nsec, gain of + 10dB, 1db compression of +15 dBM, and harmonics of <-60 dBc.  *Item (2), Ten (10)  Octave-Band, 11 Bit Digital PIN Diode Attenuators to be used with simulator systems.   Salient characteristics include:  The attenuator is capable of fast switching speed and high power handling and contains more than one tandem pair of SP2T switches with zero loss connection between one pair of outputs and a fixed attenuator inserted in the other.  The attenuator is capable of allowing for much faster switching speed, since high speed PIN diodes and drive circuitry can be used.  The attenuator is capable of offering higher power handling capacity due to RF power, which is absorbed in the fixed attenuator and not in the PIN diodes.  The attenuator is capable of having linearizing driver circuits with either analog or digital control inputs.  The attenuator is capable of having eight-bit TTL control, which is capable of providing a resolution of 0.25 dB.  The attenuator is analog in nature and the resolution is limited by the DAC used in the driver circuit. *Minimum salient characteristics have been provided above.
