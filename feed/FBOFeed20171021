NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator.

<DESC>1.	This amendment provides notification that the release date of the anticipated solicitation has changed.  The Government intends to release its solicitation on or about, January 05, 2018 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov.  The Government anticipates an award to be issued on or about November 01, 2018.  These dates are not binding, and are subject to change.

2.	This amendment provides a revised draft performance work statement (PWS) and is subject to change.  The draft PWS is provided to industry as a courtesy in order to preview the requirement prior to the formal issuance of the RFP.  There are 13 appendices, however appendix 10 and 11 are not available at this time.

3.	Anticipated Dates:  A draft RFP will not be available.  Vendors will have 30 calendar days to prepare and submit their proposals – January 05, 2018 – February 20, 2018.  Upon issuance of the anticipated RFP, vendors will have 5 calendar day to submit questions, which are due January 12, 2018.  The Government has provided sufficient information, well in advance to the vendor community, therefore it does not anticipate extending the RFP due date at this time.

4.	The size standard for the partial small business set-aside is NAICs 541519, Other Computer Relates Businesses, with a size standard of $27M.  This NAICs code has been included in the base pre-solicitation notice and all amendments.

5.	For clarification, under pre-solicitation amendment 3, #6, the statement was meant to inform the vendor community that CLIN 1a, CLIN 2a, and CLIN 3 are reserved in totality as a small business set-aside.  Therefore, the PRIME vendor must be a SMALL business.  In accordance with FAR 19 Small Business Programs, but more specifically, FAR 52.219-13, Notice of Set-Aside of Orders specifies "At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.”  There is no further restriction on the small business.  Therefore, it is a business decision as to whom the small business partners with as long as the small business is able to support 50% of the cost of the contract performance with its own personnel.

6.	Under the Full and Open (unrestricted) portion of the resulting solicitation, one proposal will be submitted from the Prime (large or small) vendor that in totality, includes all task areas – CLIN 1b, CLIN 1c, CLIN 2b, and CLIN 2c.  Partnering/ teaming / subcontracting, is at the sole discretion of the Prime vendor.  A subcontracting plan will be required for the unrestricted portion if this requirement.  As previously indicated under amendment 3 to the pre-solicitation announcement, the Government intends to award up to, but no more than three (3), IDIQ’s under the full and open portion of this requirement.

7.	Under the Partial Small Business Set-Aside portion of the resulting solicitation, one proposal will be submitted from the SMALL business Prime vendor that in totality includes all task areas - CLIN 1a, CLIN 2a, and CLIN 3.  Partnering / teaming / subcontracting is at the sole discretion of the Prime vendor.  As previously indicated under amendment 3 to the pre-solicitation announcement, the Government intends to award up to, but no more than three (3), IDIQ’s under the partial small business set-aside portion of this requirement.
