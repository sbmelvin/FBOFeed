<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Morehouse School of Medicine, Inc., 720 Westview Dr., Atlanta, Georgia 30310-1458. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to the Morehouse School of Medicine to obtain immunization data from the Georgia immunization state registry, and then identify the medical providers treating children diagnosed with rotavirus gastroenteritis and systematically contact those providers to obtain immunization records. The Morehouse School of Medicine shall accurately enter the immunization records into a prescribed electronic database and provide the database to the identified CDC project officer. Data checks will be performed by the contractor to ensure accuracy of the data entry. Georgia is the only identified state where rotavirus testing was being sufficiently performed and which had an established state immunization registry that adequately addressed the completeness of immunization records among children with possible rotavirus gastroenteritis. The immunization data will be collected on children who were evaluated for possible rotavirus disease at the emergency departments or inpatient wards of either Egleston or Scottish Rite Hospitals located in Atlanta, Georgia. These hospitals have pediatric and laboratory departments capable of collecting the required data, and they have established proprietary electronic data collection systems. For further details, see the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>These services are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Subpart 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b).<br /><br />Justification for other than full and open competition is considered based on the belief that Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution with approval from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) Institutional Review Board to access required immunization records. The records in question (see the attached Statement of Work) are the intellectual property of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) hospitals, thus Morehouse is assumed to posses a written agreement that will allow them access to these immunization records. <br />It is further believed that Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that meets the following criteria for award: <br />Morehose School of Medicine has access to immunization data from the immunization Georgia state registry. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has:<br />1.an existing partnerships with large pediatric hospital and microbiology departments located in the state of Georgia;<br />2.the expertise and familiarity with the data and mechanisms in place to retrieve the data;<br />3.experience and trained staff capable of executing the project within the necessary time frame. <br />The immunization data will be obtained both from the Georgia state immunization registry (Georgia Registry of Immunization Tracking and Services). Additional immunization records will be collected by directly contacting providers of children with possible rotavirus disease. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has access to this immunization registry and has the mechanisms in place to retrieve the required data from the immunization registry, prior to award of a contract / purchase order. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has an established business relationship with Egleston and Scottish Rite Hospital administrative staff that would allow them the capability to identify which specific child was evaluated at these hospitals for possible rotavirus gastroenteritis. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has the capability to arrange for the assistance of hospital investigators who will be involved in the project. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has the approval of the CHOA Institutional Review Board to undertake this work. The Morehouse School of Medicine is the only institution that has documented CHOA approval, and can present this docuementation to the appropriate CDC staff at the time of submission of an offeror / proposal.</p>
<p>Firms that believe they can provide the services, as listed in the attached Statement of Work, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Solicitation Number 2009-Q-11367<br /><br />Project Title: Completeness of Immunization Records in a State Immunization Registry Among Children with Possible Rotavirus Gastroenteritis<br /><br />I. BACKGROUND/NEED<br /><br />The availability of state immunization registries that have complete immunization records among children with possible rotavirus gastroenteritis will allow for rapid and efficient assessments of rotavirus vaccine effectiveness. However, because rotavirus vaccine was only relatively recently introduced into most state immunization programs (approximately June 2006), it is not known how completely the rotavirus vaccination data is being captured by the registries. One registry of interest is the Georgia immunization registry. Because certain Georgia hospitals detect many children with rotavirus gastroenteritis each year, these hospitals could be used for rotavirus vaccine effectiveness estimates if the state registry is found to be quite complete in regards to capturing rotavirus vaccine administration among these children.</p>
<p><br />II. PURPOSE <br />The purpose of this project is to evaluate the completeness of the Georgia immunization registry records among children who were evaluated for possible rotavirus gastroenteritis during 2007 through 2009.</p>
<p>III . SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall obtain immunization records on children with possible rotavirus gastroenteritis that were evaluated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) hospitals. Immunization records will be obtained from the state immunization registry and from the medical providers of the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>For children evaluated for possible rotavirus gastroenteritis during December 2007 through June 2008, and December 2008 through June 2009, the contractor shall obtain immunization records from the immunization state registry. The contractor shall also identify the medical providers of the children and systematically contact those providers by telephone to obtain the immunization records by facsimile or mail. For each child, up to 4 different medical providers will be contacted and each medical provider will be contacted up to 4 different times, as necessary, to obtain the complete immunization record. Logs of calls to providers and outcomes of the calls will be kept. The contractor shall accurately enter the immunization records from the two different sources into the electronic database and provide the database to the project officer. Data checks will be performed by the contractor to ensure accuracy of the data entry.</p>
<p>V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS</p>
<p>The project officer will provide the formatted electronic database to the contractor within 15 days of issuance of order.</p>
<p>VI. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be nine months from receipt of a CDC Purchase Order.</p>
<p>VII. DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>a. The Contractor shall provide monthly progress reports showing the work completed the previous month. Contractor shall clearly indicate the level of effort expended. The monthly progress report shall be provided to the Project Office along with a copy of the contractor's monthly invoice.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall deliver the electronic database that contains the immunization records from the registry and the medical providers to the project officer within nine months of the issuance of the order.</p>
<p>VIII. PROJECT OFFICER</p>
<p>Margaret M. Cortese, MD<br />(CDC) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br />National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases <br />Division of Viral Diseases<br />1600 Clifton Road,NE, MS A47<br />Atlanta GA 30333</p>
<p>IX. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>The contractor shall follow institutional requirements to ensure appropriate privacy safeguards during data collection efforts. Data generated under the contract will become and remains the property of the Government and may not be disseminated or otherwise released without the advance written permission of the CDC Project Officer in accordance with CDC Data Sharing/Data Release Guidelines. <br /><br />The contractor shall obtain immunization records from the immunization Georgia state registry. Georgia is the only identified state where rotavirus testing was being sufficiently performed and which had an established state immunization registry that adequately addressed the completeness of immunization records among children with possible rotavirus gastroenteritis. The CDC requires that the proposed Contractor have:<br />1.an existing partnerships with large pediatric hospital and microbiology departments located in the state of Georgia;<br />2.the expertise and familiarity with the data and mechanisms in place to retrieve the data;<br />3.experience and trained staff capable of executing the project within the necessary time frame. <br />The immunization data will be collected on children who were evaluated for possible rotavirus disease at the emergency departments or inpatient wards of either Egleston or Scottish Rite Hospitals located in Atlanta, Georgia. These hospitals have pediatric and laboratory departments capable of collecting the required data, and they have established proprietary electronic data collection systems.</p>
<p>The immunization data will be obtained both from the Georgia state immunization registry (Georgia Registry of Immunization Tracking and Services). Additional immunization data will be collected by directly contacting providers of children with possible rotavirus disease. Any vendor interested in working with the CDC on this project, must have access to this immunization registry and have the mechanisms in place to retrieve the required data from the immunization registry, prior to award of a contract / purchase order. Furthermore, the vendor must have an established business relationship with Egleston and Scottish Rite Hospital administrative staff that would allow them the capability to identify which specific child was evaluated at these hospitals for possible rotavirus gastroenteritis. The vendor must be capable of arranging for the assistance of hospital investigators who will be involved in the project. The vendor must have the approval of the CHOA Institutional Review Board to undertake this work, prior to the award of a CDC contract / purchase order. The CHOA Institutional Review Board approval must be documented and presented to the appropriate CDC staff at the time of submission of an interested parties offeror / proposal.</p>
