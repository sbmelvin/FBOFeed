<DESC>Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, Polar Services, (RPSC) will be soliciting proposals towards securing a charter for a Research Vessel with Ice Breaking capability (RVIB) to operate in the Southern Oceans around Antarctica and other locations in support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).
<p>RPSC presently charters and provides science support staffing on the ARSV LAURENCE M. GOULD and the RVIB NATHANIEL B. PALMER for the National Science Foundation (NSF), an agency of the United States Government. On behalf of the NSF, RPSC is pursuing the charter of a vessel to meet the oceanographic and logistics support requirements of the USAP. The vessel is to be chartered for a period of five (5) years with options for up to another five (5) years. The purpose of this announcement is to seek interested parties in industry capable of supplying a vessel to continue to provide services currently supported by the RVIB NATHANIEL B. PALMER. RPSC will be seeking proposals that include the building of a new ship or the reconditioning and/or overhaul of an existing similar classed vessel.</p>
<p>The vessel will be required to operate frequently in the often extremely stormy waters south of Cape Horn in the Drake Passage with regular operations south of 60 degrees South Latitude and in sea ice to support oceanographic research and USAP logistics for Palmer Station and other field locations. The vessel must be seaworthy, fully found, appropriately classed, be able to provide a stable platform from which to conduct scientific research and comfortable enough to safely support personnel at sea for extended periods. Such remote operations necessarily require a reliable and well fitted vessel. Operations in support of scientific research will be the key evaluation criteria within the technical requirements of the Request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an RFP will be issued in July 2010. To receive the full RFP, industry is requested to provide "Letters of Interest" by 11 July 2010 to:</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Network 23 Contracting Office intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source procurement with Receivia Inc. under the authority 6.302-1 using simplified acquisition procedures (FAR Part 13).

Contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, services and to successfully satisfy the requirement.

The VA believes that Receivia Inc. is the only company that can complete this project in the timeframe required (obtain clearance, system access, and complete the project by September 01, 2010). Receivia  Inc., who currently holds General Service Administration contract GS-23F-0229K, and VA Blanket Purchase Agreement VA 101 (049A3)-BP-0161 is currently performing similar related tasks for VISN 23, and therefore already has computer access and meets security requirements, and will be able to complete the project no later than the required deadline.     

NAICS code for the procurement is 561440; Collection Agencies; Size Standard $7M. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than May 29, 2010 at 12:00PM. Supporting evidence must include the company name, address, phone and fax numbers, a point of contact, and be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements for services. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely by the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquires will only be accepted by email at Stuard.eidenschink@va.gov .

<DESC>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.Description of project:  Contractor will furnish all labor, material, supervision and equipment to construct the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) Facility at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified the need to establish modern secure biocontainment facilities and provide technologies, products and capabilities to support DHS in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to terrorist attack and major disasters involving biological threat agents (BTA).  The NBACC facility will be located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) at Fort Detrick and will serve to establish an enduring national capability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from bioterrorist attack.  The NBACC project will establish a facility comprised of biocontainment laboratories at the BSL (biosafety) 2, 3, & 4 levels with the capability to conduct testing of aerosolized high hazard threat agents against animals, bench research on threat agents, and bioforensics analysis.  The proposed 160,000 square foot building, which will be a stand-alone facility in terms of utilities, will provide a full-scale operational bioforensics capability and a smaller, but still significant, capability to perform threat characterization research of biothreat agents.    The Government intends to utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) concept for this procurement.  Under this contract the CMc will function as a collaborative member of the project team and shall be an active participant in pre-construction by providing expertise during the design process (e.g., checking estimates, performing constructability reviews, and design mockups).  The CMc is responsible for all construction, construction supervision, and inspection responsibilities.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers and general contractors.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMC shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors ; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  The CMc shall provide the FLETC with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase, likely at about 70%, a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be negotiated and construction of the project will begin.  The CMc will be contractually bound to pay for costs that exceed the GMP unless the Government changes the scope.  The estimated construction cost is $100 million, to include the CMc’s Preconstruction and Construction Phase Services. This procurement will be negotiated on a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101, based primarily on a trade-off between technical qualifications, present/past performance, and price, with all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, considered significantly more important than price.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.   Offerors will be evaluated on relevant corporate experience, past performance on relevant contracts where the offeror acted as prime contractor or CMc, Key Personnel, to include experience and qualification of proposed staff, and price.  The price proposal will include pricing of the CMc’s cost of Pre-construction Services and a total fee for Construction Phase Services, including profit, General Conditions, and other overhead costs.  Interested firms should, as early as possible, but no later than December 30, 2004, indicate interest in this acquisition by letter (no more than 2 typewritten pages), referencing the solicitation number, with a brief summary of experience in relevant contracts (scope and magnitude) where the offeror acted as a prime contractor or CMc, particularly in the construction of level 2, 3, and 4 laboratories, or similar facilities.  The offeror should describe its performance of the pre-design and construction phase services provided.  The letter should clearly identify the business size, i.e., large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.  Due to the estimated value of this project, the letter must also provide the offerors bonding capacity (single project and aggregate limit).  Letters should be sent to the attention of Bob Driggers, Contracting Officer, at the contracting office address listed above, preferably as an e-mail attachment.  More detailed present/past performance information will be required with proposals.  In response to the solicitation, offerors will be required to demonstrate their ability to perform projects of a similar scope and magnitude, perform quality work, complete projects on schedule, and at a reasonable price.  Award of the resulting contract will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror.  It is the intent of the Government to negotiate and award a contract to a well qualified firm with extensive experience in performing projects of similar scope and magnitude.  The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under this contract.  The solicitation will be available about the end of February, 2005, with proposals due about mid-April, 2005.  The Government’s final procurement strategy will be based on the responses from qualified firms.  If you are interested in this solicitation, please provide the information required above, point of contact, company phone, fax number and e-mail address, to Bob Driggers, Contracting Officer, phone 912-261-3630, fax 912-280-5343, or email: Bob.Driggers@dhs.gov or Paulette Webster, Procurement Technician, phone 912-554-4613, email: Paulette.Webster@dhs.gov no later than December 30, 2004.

<DESC>PLEASE REFER TO THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT FOR ACCESS TO THE LINKS OUTLINED IN THIS NOTICE.
<p>PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) - ST10-1096<br />This Announcement is issued by SAIC-Frederick (SAIC-F) in support of its prime contract awarded by the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-F). For more information regarding this relationship, see www.ncifcrf.gov. This document should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of SAIC-F, or the Government. SAIC-F does not intend to award a subcontract(s) on the basis of responses to this Anouncement, nor pay for the preparation of information provided herein. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>A. PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>The purpose of this Announcement is to provide potential subcontractors with notification of a request for proposal to follow within the next 30 days. This Announcement references a Request for Information RFI - Pharmacodynamic (PD) tests into Phase 0 clinical trials. The Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) at NCI-F will promote the introduction of promising cancer therapeutics through the integration of appropriate pharmacodynamic (PD) tests into Phase 0 clinical trials with the focus on gathering evidence of targeted drug action that enables early Go/NoGo decisions. This Announcement notifies non-profit organizations, academics, clinical centers, and industry on the following topics:</p>
<p><br />1. Technologies and key cancer related pharmacodynamic targets for the next generation of PD assays that are to be developed using readily clinically adoptable state-of-the-art tools. <br />a. Utilization of multiplexed assay platforms that enable multiple PD readouts from small amounts of specimens coupled with robust annotation and data management to include: multi-channel microscopy, ELISAs, Laser Capture, PCR, etc. The goal is to maximize the amount of PD information that can be obtained from a single specimen. Combinatory markers have the greatest potential for providing valid and clinically relevant drug action and patient response information in genetically diverse populations.<br />b. The next generation of PD Assays must query multiple validated cancer specific analytes simultaneously to include the following categories: <br />1) Interrogate multiple targets within a molecular pathway, such as cellular signaling in the PI3K/Akt/PTEN axis, the glycolysis pathways, NOTCH and RAS pathways. DNA repair,and early markers of Apoptosis.<br />2) An assay platform to focus on quantitative multiplex assays in appropriate formats, e.g., tissue slides and cell extracts.<br />3) Development of new technologies and platforms for Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC).<br />4) Quantify multiple molecular events on the same target molecule, for example, activating and suppressing modifications of individual Akt isozymes or multiple phosphorylation sites on the MET receptor.<br />5) Filter target detection and quantitation to allow measurement in specific cellular compartments (e.g.plasma membrane and nucleus). <br />c. Establish an infrastructure to provide access to key reagents (antibodies &amp; probes, calibrators, references, etc), specimens (repositories, storage, processing, etc)), and accessory technologies (software, robotics, etc) that are essential for development of robust, sensitive, reproducible tests. This topic includes quality controlled production of critical reagents, regulatory (FDA/CLIA/CAP) knowledge and compliance, pattern recognition software, data analysis software that gives easily interpretable results, nanotechology for biopsies, and much more.<br />2. Opportunities to respond to, and participate in, future subcontracting events in support of the pharmacodynamic assay initiative.</p>
<p>3. Opportunities to bid upon solutions in the core areas listed above, using their specific expertise.</p>

<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY<br />1. Pharmacodynamics Goal<br />To dramatically increase the throughput of drug candidates evaluated in &lsquo;First In Human' early Phase 0 and Phase I clinical trials, by providing Mechanism of Action data through PD assays that monitor drug effects on the defined target, enabling &lsquo;early' data-driven decisions on the &lsquo;drugability' of candidates. <br />2. Pharmacodynamics Vision<br />The PD Assay initiative is to bring DCTD, academia, clinical centers, non-profits, and diagnostic and pharma industries together to facilitate &lsquo;drug specific' assay development to meet pharmacodynamic needs over the next five years. The strategy is to leverage the knowledge and resources of these entities to create joint endeavors to develop high value PD assays that will have the biggest clinical impact in cancer patient care.<br />This notice is a time-sensitive RFI regarding the feasibility of establishing an integrated pharmacodynamic network of government, industry, non-profits, clinical organizations, and academia with specific PD assay development skills, technology, reagent production, and other expertise to address unmet needs in cancer pharmacodynamics. <br />The response to this RFI will be used to assess the feasibility of assembling a consortium of expertise to participate in development of DCTD's PD Assay program, to support the development of first-in-class, targeted molecular therapeutic agents.</p>
<p>3. Background</p>
<p>The integration of molecular diagnostics as a tool for personalized medicine has been delayed due to economy, regulatory, healthcare insurers, clinical adoption, and other factors. Many of the assays and techniques introduced today may take years to replace the standard of care, especially with healthcare systems' emphasis on cost/benefit analysis for new technology adoption, the market value and thus implementation of newer approaches may be limited. One way that NCI-F can help with the introduction of these tests is to create incentives and provide support for companies, academia, clinical centers, and non-profit organizations to develop and launch PD assays with the required analytical and clinical validation. NCI-F through careful strategic action in the Pharmacodynamic arena can make a big impact in clinical medicine over the next 5 years by supporting the introduction of critical PD assays on clinically adoptable technology platforms.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the NCI-F will work with the organizations and companies in the joint development of robust pharmacodiagnostic assays for immediate clinical needs via collaboration and partnership. An example of this collaboration would be, in addition to funding, the provision of bulk critical reagents, calibrators, and positive and negative controls generated in NCI-F's laboratories and in GMP contracting and manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, NCI-F in association with National Cancer Centers will support the "clinical validation" in part through Phase 0/I drug trials, which can generate FDA-quality data for regulatory submissions. The clinical validation of an assay is critical to capture market share through widespread clinical adoption, as well as to obtain coverage by healthcare insurers. Although the type of partnership/collaboration will be unique for each assay and organization, the NCI-F will be able to assist the entity defray some of the costs and speed up the timeline for generating data required for CLIA laboratory adoption and/or 510K or PMA approval by leveraging NCI-F's resources and partners.</p>
<p>The scientific and clinical expertise and novel technologies assembled within this PD initiative will expedite the development of promising new PD assays that will support cancer drug development and facilitate First-in-Human clinical trials under NCI-F sponsorship. The technology and assays must meet strict clinical value criteria to be advanced into the clinical setting, thus focusing NCI-F's resources on the most promising pharmacodynamic analytes. <br />Strategic partnering of NCI-F with companies and organizations that have clinically adoptable technology and &lsquo;Freedom to Operate' positions for key oncology target molecules will help to insure the success of DCTD's PD and Phase 0 initiatives.<br />The following are links to NCI-F and NIH resources available for reference:</p>

<p>BACK to ProgramSummary</p>
<p>Attachment 4<br />INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP)</p>
<p>Please note that IP will be further addressed in the SAIC-Frederick, Inc. Subcontract Agreement.</p>
<p>The patent rights for inventions first produced in the performance of potential subcontracts will be governed by the Bayh-Dole Act as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) clause 52.227-11 Patent Rights (Dec 2007).</p>
<p>Rights in data first produced in the performance of potential subcontracts will be governed by FAR 52.227-14 Rights in Data (Dec 2007).</p>
<p>Although the management of patent rights for inventions produced under the pharmacodynamic assay initiative will be governed by the Bayh-Dole Act, effective sharing of resources and data are considered to be imperative to the success of the overarching NCI-F program. Furthermore, it is essential that some guarantee of IP management that facilitates and promotes the discovery and development of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates in this regard is provided.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) intends to procure liquid nitrogen vapor phase cryo-storage system.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 332420 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. Delivery to be made within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) is conducting functional analysis of genetic variants that have been found to be associated with increased risk for certain cancers in genome wide association studies (GWAS). The goal of functional studies is to determine the mechanisms of gene function and how they are perturbed in disease. To fully understand the role of these genetic variations in cancer and use this information to improve disease diagnostics and treatment, the next line of research is to explore molecular mechanisms affected by cancer-associated genetic variants. The majority of common susceptibility variants discovered in GWAS to date are non-coding variants that may increase risk of disease through regulatory effects on molecular phenotypes such as mRNA and microRNA expression. Therefore, the ability to correlate risk variants to gene expression is of utmost importance. To do this the NCI will conduct a genome wide expression analysis of tumors and normal tissue to develop a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression in tumors and normal tissue. Expression levels will subsequently be compared to genomic variants to investigate if variants that increase the risk of cancer are accompanied with altered gene expression. The NCI has purchased 588 samples from commercial biorespositories for this project and are beginning to extract DNA and RNA from these tissues. As the collection expands&nbsp;the need for cold storage continues to increase.</p>
<p>The NCI has nearly reached the capacity of current liquid nitrogen vapor phase cryo-storage system. At this time a second system is needed that will provide adequate space for continued growth. The NCI needs an additional liquid nitrogen vapor phase cryo-storage system to accommodate the tissue bank and provide room for future use.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov or fax (301) 402-4513. Interested parties shall include the name of company; complete mailing address; point of contacts, phone, fax numbers, and email address; company DUNS number and business size.</p>
<p>All questions shall be in writing and may be addressed to the aforementioned individual noted above. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).</p>

<DESC>Posted: June 18, 2010<br />Post Expires: July 12, 2010
<p>NOAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office<br />United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Program, Silver Spring, MD, is exploring options for development of a Training Module that will provide NOAA employees with a basic understanding of UAS and their capabilities. This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and is not a Request for Proposal. A Request for Quote (RFQ) may not be issued against this RFI. <br />The RFI is posted in an effort to identify interested parties capable of providing this training module. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals; and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. The government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request. All information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. <br />Background<br />NOAA is interested in using a diverse array of platforms for a broad variety of operations. Over the past several years NOAA has been testing UAS as a potential observation platform to take measurements in areas where manned aircraft flights are not possible due to long flight durations and/or hazardous conditions, or where remote monitoring is not adequate. NOAA is interested in developing the use of UAS technology at NOAA in order to improve its ability to monitor the global environment<br />by filling the critical data gaps in our current measurement systems over remote and dangerous regions. These include the Atlantic and Gulf coast hurricane regions, the Arctic, the open oceans, remote islands and wildfires, atmospheric rivers, marine sanctuaries. The UAS Program was formalized three years ago, and only a small segment of NOAA understands the benefits and capabilities offered by UAS. As the UAS program transitions to operations, education and outreach will become critical to NOAA's understanding of the potential role of UAS as a platform that can expand NOAA's observational capabilities in support of NOAA's mission. The NOAA UAS program has therefore identified the need to develop a training module for internal NOAA employees, which describes the basic benefits of using UAS. <br />Training Module Defined Training Module in this case is defined by a training that will provide employees across all the NOAA programs with a basic understanding of the capabilities that UAS have as observing platforms in support of NOAA's mission. The training module will need to be developed for a diverse audience; the target audience will have a range of skills and level of understanding with respect to science and technology concepts. The Training Module will describe: the benefits of UAS and their applications in support of NOAA's mission; the range of UAS platforms, payloads and mission capabilities; and the operational support provided by NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The Training Module should provide links to additional information about individual UAS platforms and instruments that can be used on UAS, and should provide key program points of contact for ongoing questions and further learning.<br />This RFI seeks input that will guide the NOAA UAS program's solicitation for FY2011 at which time the UAS Program will use the information gathered through this process to facilitate future development of the training module. Responses to this request for information will help the UAS Program Office understand the components that should comprise a Training Module for NOAA employees. <br />Questions to Address in Response to RFI: 1. what are the best training practices available for internal employee training and what is the ideal scope of such a training?<br />2. How would you develop a basic training module that can be repeated as needed to individuals or groups requiring a basic understanding of the developing UAS technology? <br />3. How would the training module demonstrate that UAS are an observing platform that can support NOAA's mission?<br />4. How would the training module address any audience questions?<br />5. How would the training module create an interest in the audience to further inquire about the benefits of UAS for their particular program? <br />6. How would the effectiveness of the training module be measured?</p>
<p>7. What are you approximate costs? (This is for market research purposes only and does not constitute a RFQ). <br />8. What is the general timeframe needed to develop the training module? <br />9. What are the requirements necessary to implement the training module?<br />Response Format: Please limit responses to 5 pages single-spaced, in 12-point font and standard margins on 8.5 by 11 papers. <br />Where to Send Responses, Comments, Questions and Timeframe: All information including comments, questions, and recommendations should be submitted by email at Suzanne.Garrett@NOAA.Gov and Sara.Summers@NOAA.Gov or fax 303-497-7719, and should be received by 12:01 p.m. MST, Thursday, Date July 12 2010. <br />Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Suzanne Romberg-Garrett and Sara Summers through the email addresses: Suzanne.Romberg-Garrett@NOAA.Gov and Sara.Summers@NOAA.Gov</p>

<DESC>Synopsis for COVE 1 Expansion Software Licenses
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) Advanced Marine Center located in Washington, DC under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." This acquisition is for the procurement of Virtual Ship&reg; Version 5.0 Specific Software Licenses to expand the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) 1 Training System from twelve (12) to eighteen (18) training stations, and provide one (1) Master Instructors Operator Station (MIOS). Included in this requirement is an update of the Virtual Ship Unique Install Disk for COVE 1 stations thirteen (13) through eighteen (18) and the MIOS, and all files necessary to configure COVE 1 Stations 13-18 and the MIOS. These software licences are required to provide integrated training with COVE 1 Stations 1-12. The estimated budget for this requirement is $125,000 with installation in November 2010.</p>
<p>The Government does not possess adequate rights to the technical data necessary to competitively award this contract. Furthermore, neither the budget nor schedule for this procurement allow for an alternative software solution, which would require a re-host of the entire COVE 1 environment. To remove the existing barrier to competition as described above, NAWCTSD intends to competitively issue a single award, Indefinite Delivery type contract in Fiscal Year 2010/11, which will allow for competing software solutions. This requirement will be advertised under a separate synopsis.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be submitted by 2 July 2010. Responses must demonstrate the interested party's ability to provide a solution that supports the current COVE 1 software baseline, in the absence of a non-exclusive, non-pass through teaming arrangement with CSC.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed to the point of contact in this posting. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future acquisition.</p>
<p>Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Irene Pollard (irene.pollard@navy.mil or 407-380-8143).</p>

This project will includes all labor, material and equipment, transportation, supervision, and incidental related work required to complete the demolition of building 176 and consolidate into building 45 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard located in Kittery, Maine.  This project will be conducted in two phases.  Phase one will account for miscellaneous renovations at building 45, which includes but is not lim ited to the addition of interior window treatments, the addition of sewer lines and a manhole, the demolition of two story additions on the west side of the building, and the upgrading of the mechanical and electrical systems to building 45.  These renovations will be completed in order to accommodate Radiography "cubes" and the film processing and developing functions with related office, training, and support areas.  Phase two of this project will begin roughly 45 days after the completion and acceptance of the renovations to building 45.  The requirements for phase two are for the demolition of building 176.  Once building 176 is demolished the site will be restored to a primarily grassy area.   The total price magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

Sole Source Synopsis

Radiogardase

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies. BARDA’s mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN), in support of the preparedness mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) articulated in the PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.  The Implementation Plan for CBRN agents is located on the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) website http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/barda/phemc/index.html and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza on the website http://www.pandemicflu.gov.

The Government intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to the Heyltex Corporation for the performance of research and development (R&D) to develop a satisfactory method of administering Radiogardase® (Prussian blue) to pediatric subjects (age 0-2) and acquire FDA approval for language in the Radiogardase® package insert that provides for the safe and effective use of the current formulation administered to members of the pediatric population (age 0-2 years) to reduce or eliminate internalized radioactive cesium (e.g., Cs-137) due to ingestion, inhalation, or other routes of exposure. 

Radiogardase® is an FDA-approved product produced and distributed by the Heyltex Corporation with market exclusivity rights issued under the Orphan Drug Rule.  The HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) has a requirement to treat adults and children, including the 0-2 years of age range, who have internal contamination (ingested, inhaled, or otherwise) with radioactive cesium (e.g., Cs-137).  The US Government currently has a surplus of Prussian blue, the FDA-approved treatment for Cs-137 decorporation in people greater than 2 years of age.  The product in its current capsular form, however, is not FDA-approved for use in the age 0-2 years population.  The work required is to obtain FDA approval for language in the Radiogardase® (Prussian blue) package insert that provides for the safe and effective use of the current formulation of Radiogardase® (FDA-approved for use in subjects of other ages), when administered to members of the pediatric population of age 0-2 years.

Potential offerors who believe they may be capable of offering the requested services and would like to be considered as an alternative source are required to contact the Contracting Specialist by the published response time.  State the Offeror’s name, point of contact and a brief description of the services that may be provided that will accomplish the stated requirement so that the Government may make a determination of the feasibility of allowing open competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a Photovoltaic (PV) and/ or Concentrated Photovoltaic (CPV) Solar Power Plant in Jordan.</p>
<p>Jordan has almost no indigenous energy resources and energy imports account for nearly 10% of GDP. Due to economic growth and increasing population, energy demand is expected to increase by at least 50% over the next 20 years. Therefore, increased access to reasonably priced indigenous energy sources is crucial to successful economic reform and the reduction of Jordan's dependence on foreign sources of energy. The Government of Jordan is committed to increasing the share of indigenous energy resources, including all renewables and oil shale, from their current level of about 0.5% of total electricity generation capacity to around 10% of total installed capacity.</p>
<p>The feasibility study will include a detailed assessment for the implementation of a 100MW PV/ CPV power plant that is expected to go into production by the end of 2012. The Grantee has plans to expand the project to a second stage of 100MW by 2015 for a total of 200MW. The first stage of the project would occupy 2 million square meters, utilize approximately 360,000 to one million PV panels, and would have the potential to produce around 160 GWh per year, preventing around 160,000 tons of CO2 emissions. Upon completion, the first stage of the project would be one of the world's largest PV power plants, putting Jordan on the world's renewable energy map. The project has broad support from the Jordanian government and was announced during the World Economic Forum (WEF 09) at the Dead Sea 2009, in the presence of His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan.</p>
<p>The study will examine the feasibility of a PV/ CPV project and assist in developing a well defined implementation plan, including a technology evaluation as well as a facility and equipment assessment. The study will identify the specific needs of a solar power facility, which could help in increasing the availability of this free and clean source of energy. As evidenced by the Government of Jordan's commitment to clean energy, there is a huge potential for power and energy projects in Jordan and the proposed study creates an opportunity for U.S. providers to enter and strengthen their positions in the Jordanian market.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $617,204 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a Concentrated Solar Power Plant in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Increasing renewable energy sources is a policy priority for the Government of Lebanon, as the country lacks indigenous sources of energy and imports nearly 99 percent of its energy. High costs and insufficient supplies have lead to frequent electricity outages, resulting in significant damage to the economy and the tourism industry. In the electricity sector, the main electricity company, EDL (Electricit&eacute; du Liban), imports around $500 million worth of fuel each year to meet its basic energy needs. Government loans of $200&#8208;500 million are annually passed in an effort to prevent EDL from going bankrupt due to inefficiencies and transmission losses. Despite large government investments in the power sector, demand still exceeds supply, and blackouts are common in peak demand times.</p>
<p>Renewable energy currently plays a minor role in the energy mix in Lebanon. Lebanon experiences over 300 days of sunshine a year, making solar energy one of the better alternatives for a renewable energy source. While solar energy has rarely been used to generate electricity, energy savings from the use of solar thermal collectors are widespread in Lebanon. This feasibility study (FS) would follow the success of the solar thermal industry and develop a plan for effectively implementing Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology in the Byblos region with good potential to replicate this technology in other areas.<br /><br />The FS will assess CSP technology and analyze the construction of a 50 MW CSP power plant in the Byblos area of Lebanon. The lack of sufficient service in this area of Lebanon has prompted many businesses to implement self-generation techniques for electricity usage. Such techniques are costly and continue to fall short of meeting energy needs. Except for some small company concessions to generate electricity, EDL monopolizes the generation and distribution market, and the law prohibits electricity generation for sale to the grid. Therefore, the project will generate electricity to sell it directly to industrial estates in the vicinity of the proposed site. The study will include an analysis determining the best CSP technology to use; a techno-economic assessment; engineering, procurement and construction cost estimates; and a project implementation plan for a 50 MW CSP power plant.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $338,270 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<CONTACT>Vinita N. Chambers, Phone 4057395802, Email vinita.chambers@tinker.af.mil
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information</span></strong><br />The 827ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is requesting information on portable Internal Cargo Lighting for the KC-135 R/T model aircraft. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This RFI is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources. Contractors responding to this RFI shall submit information electronically no later than 2 July 2010, 3:00 p.m. CST.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span></strong><br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry for options of portable internal cargo lighting for the USAF KC-135 R/T aircraft.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong><br />The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic aero medical Evacuation (AE) missions. Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient patient care by AE crewmembers (AECM). Poor illumination, especially for litter patients, makes clinical assessment and treatment very difficult. A portable, non-handheld light source capable of AE patient illumination by AECMs is required to ensure proper patient assessment and safe patient movement. Zone lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other patients is desired. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</span></strong> <br />The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution proposed in response to this RFI. All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement.<br />1. The lighting system should provide visible spectrum light of adequate intensity capable of illuminating the cargo area such that crew are able to fully visualize a litter patient without interfering with patient care. Night vision friendly mode is desirable, but not a requirement. <br />2. The system will require no modification of main aircraft structure. Ancillary structure may be used for hardware attachment.<br />3. Some testing required IAW MIL-STD-810 or DO-160. Specific areas of concern include explosive atmosphere, vibration, temperature and shock.<br />4. Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology is the preferred lighting solution. <br />5. Lighting color should be white with no tint or tinge of other color<br />6. Light intensity is subjective. Light should be of adequate intensity to perform all mission operations. Any quantification or qualification of lighting should include foot candle measurement. References should be included, i.e. OSHA, AMA, etc.<br />7. Lighting should be focused on cargo or pallet interior. Use of reflectors and diffusers should be documented as well as the impact on intensity.<br />8. Lighting solution should consider ease to install and maintain.<br />9. Lighting equipment must not interfere with mission operations, i.e. cargo loading.<br />10. The current aero medical mission utilizes three patient support pallets. A zone lighting concept is preferred. At a minimum, this should involve one zone per pallet and one zone for the boom area for a total of four zones. The entire cargo area should be covered by this area, beginning with the galley/latrine area and ending at the boom area.<br />11. Lighting controls should be easily accessed. Lighting controls should be placed in the galley area and at the forward edge of each patient support pallet. The forward lighting control should be able to control each lighting zone. This control should be able to turn all lights on and off. The lighting controls at each pallet should be able to turn the lights on and off for the corresponding pallet zone. This allows patients at one pallet to rest while care is provided to patients on an adjacent pallet. <br />12. The light solution should provide a dimming feature. This should provide varying degrees of intensity from off to fully illuminated. Dimming may be provided in steps or continuous. Dimming control should be incorporated into lighting control at each pallet.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OPERATING ENVIRONMENT:</span></strong> <br />The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS:</span></strong> <br />Primary power source should be aircraft power. The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28 VDC. Portable lighting solution should include provisions for operating on the ground with no external or generator power available. The KC-135 has two 28 VDC batteries. The dissipated power should be minimized to avoid complete battery discharge. <br />Lighting controls should be easily accessed and operated. <br />Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL APPROACH:</span></strong><br />Provide a brief high-level technical description of the portable lighting system. The technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks. Describe the type of training that will be required to operate the proposed system. Briefly summarize how personnel would operate the system. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COMPATIBILITY</span></strong> <br />Explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING</span></strong><br />State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COST</span></strong><br />Provide the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVAILABILITY</span></strong> <br />Provide system availability information.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC), Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L) Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM CAS) is conducting a Market Research/Sources Sought Notice to locate firms  with the capability to design, develop, integrate, and test a near-precision guidance kit prototype capable of a delivery accuracy of  30 meter Circular Error Probability (CEP) and compatible with current stockpiled US Government (USG) inventory of 105mm artillery projectiles.
The USG may pursue awarding contracts that will assess the maturity of prototypes and the path required to achieve both Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (demonstrated in an operationally relevant environment) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6 (demonstrated in a production relevant environment) in accordance with the Precision Guidance Kit Increment 2 (PGK-2) Draft Capabilities Development Document (DRAFT-CDD) Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Attributes.  It should be noted that these KPPs and Attributes are potential candidates and have not been formally validated through the Army Capabilities Integration Center.  The anticipated period of performance is 8 months and it is anticipated to be executed within Government Fiscal Year (FY12).   
The USG is interested in the respondents feedback in accordance with the PGK-2 DRAFT-CDD KPPs and Attributes and contract period of performance listed above for: 
1.	The ability to demonstrate Critical Technology Elements (CTE) categorized by function as  Guidance and Control, Fuzing and Power in a relevant environment; a.	What are the current Technology Readiness Levels in accordance with the DoD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook, dated July 2009, for each CTE?b.	Are there any emerging technological developments in Guidance and Control CTE that can be applied?2.	The ability to demonstrate CTE within a deep intrusion form factor (per PGK-2 DRAFT-CDD KPPs and Attributes) and delivery of up to 20 prototypes for full Guidance and Control demonstration plus up to 20 mass simulants for unguided flight demonstration delivered to a Government Proving Grounds within 8 months of contract award.  If unable to meet deep intrusion requirement, include a discussion on intentions to utilize 105mm projectile body for power, data collection, overflow of packaging, etc. for the prototypes.  If unable to set the prototype with Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) during the competitive prototyping phase, discuss the external resources required and their function. Note: Performance of the prototype Guidance and Control will be measured by ground instrumentation available at the proving grounds and provided by the Government such as high speed video, radar, copper crusher gauges, muzzle velocity radars, telemetry, and, survey data of projectile impacts.  Either telemetry or On-Board Recorder data is required to demonstrate that the Guidance and Control is performing the proper function to successfully guide the projectile and needs to be provided by the respondent.  3.	Identification of trade-offs (performance versus cost versus schedule) to meet all requirements in the PGK-2 DRAFT-CDD KPPs and Attributes;4.	The ability of the design to meet the accuracy KPP for, at a minimum, threshold requirements for the M1, M760, and M913 under the following conditions (Provide supporting data and limiting factors such as maneuverability, GPS Acquisition time, and calculated CEP; use simulation data where possible): a.	Short flight timeb.	Low launch velocitiesc.	Max ranged.	High QE above 1100 mils5.	The potential for gyroscopic instability and its impact on the accuracy performance (i.e., CEP) of the design based on the following firing scenarios: a.	Low launch velocitiesb.	Longest flight time c.	Cold Atmosphere 6.	The level of production realism, advanced technologies and newer manufacturing capabilities required to achieve a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6 in accordance with the DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level Deskbook, dated 3 January 2010.  Based on historical data, contractors ability to produce prototypes in a production relevant environment prior to Program Milestone (MS) B has been limited.  The competitive prototyping requirements include demonstration of the contractors ability to meet MRL 6 thereby reducing risk during any future development phases and lowering overall system costs.  Discussions should include:a.	The capability to build the critical technology elements to support Guidance and Control, Power and Fuzing (e.g. size, tolerances, quality levels, processes, and testing) in the facility intended to be used during future production.  b.	Increased resources required to address manufacturing processes for integrating these critical technology elements into a full-up system should be presented. 
Interested respondents may obtain the following upon request and coordination with the POC listed below. (Note:  A Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed and on file and a Form DD2345 will be required): -	Precision Guidance Kit Increment 2 (PGK-2) Draft Capabilities Development Document (DRAFT-CDD) Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Attributes-	105MM Data Aero Coefficients -	105MM Weapon/ Projectile Interface -	Physical Properties Interface Matrix of 105MM and 155MM Projectiles

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice (SS). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business, under the applicable NAICS code, should not submit a response to this notice. 
The NAICS code for the project is 334516. 
The small business size standard is 500 employees. 
The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can provide the scientific equipment to provide a transmission electron microscope, that has the capability to enable users to obtain ultrastructural and microanalytical data by record electron micgrographs and x-ray spectra from a wide variety of different biological specimens to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).  The new instrument will replace an old model FEI CM120 electron microscope purchased in 1996; thus, it is critical that the dimensions of the accessories are identical to the Philips CM120.  The new transmission electron microscope (TEM) must include a large number of special features that will enable high performance, while maintaining ease of operation for researchers within the NIH intramural program.

(1) TEM must operate at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.  

(2) TEM must provide a line resolution of 0.2 nm as tested on a gold lattice image.

(3) TEM must provide 2D and 3D imaging of cells, cell organelles and soft materials, both at room and liquid-nitrogen temperature using a cryo-holder.

(4) TEM must have magnification range from as low as 20x to as high as 600,000x. 

(5) TEM must provide a high-level of automation, including automated gun alignments and automated correction of focus and astigmatism variations. 

(6) All TEM components, including the electron gun, the optical elements, the vacuum system and the stage, must be completely digitally controlled. 

(7) TEM must have a task-oriented user interface that allows users to automatically recall all optimized operating conditions, including lens settings, gun parameters, optical alignments, for all the different operation modes of TEM and STEM.

(8) The TEM CCD camera, as well as any future upgrade of STEM detectors and energy-dispersive x-ray detector must be fully computer controlled. 

(9) Data acquisition, with all detectors, must be embedded in the user interface and be capable of automation for acquisition processes, including tomography. 

(10) TEM must be suitable for a multi-user environment.

(11) TEM must be easily connected to a network for exporting data and ready for remote operation capabilities, allowing for operation from adjacent rooms and remote viewing during data acquisition.

(12) TEM column must contain a gun with a Wehnelt assembly suitable for tungsten filaments or LaB6 cathodes.  The column must be comprised of two condenser lenses: an objective lens with a computerized 5-axes eucentric goniometer, a diffraction lens, an intermediate lens and two projector lenses.

(13) TEM must should include a projection chamber with a viewing window, a large (greater than 150 mm diameter) viewing screen, and a small screen for critical focusing with the aid of a high-quality 12x binocular viewer and a beam-stop mechanism.

(14) TEM must be equipped with a 2k x 2k (4 Megapixels) cooled CCD camera.  The camera should provide x1, x2, x3, x4, and x6 binning to allow maximum flexibility for image acquisition.

<DESC>POC: Sharon Walker, Contract Specialist, (816) 426-7470
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), located in Miami, FL intends to acquire services for Doppler Wind Lidar data collection and processing software along with training.</p>
<p>DESC: This is a notice to acquire services Doppler Wind Lidar data collection and processing software along with training</p>
<p>NOAA (AOML) and the Navy (Office of Naval Research) has a need for the installation and operation of a Doppler Wind Lidar (2 micron laser with a side mounted bi-axial scanner) on a NOAA P3 aircraft. It is planned that this system will be deployed for the first time by NOAA some time before July 2010. This Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) system is a "one-of-a-kind" and was flown for the first time on a Navy P3 in 2008. It is a research instrument and is still under development. The data collection and processing proprietary software is of research grade and thus NOAA requires the presence of the software developer during all phases of the 2010 research program. In order to expedite the utility of the DWL data, it is critical that NOAA have the system developer and PI perform the data processing, quality control and distribution functions until such time that NOAA can do so internally. Since NOAA intends to use this, or a similar instrument, in the future, training of NOAA personnel in its operations is also needed. <br />While the Navy (ONR) is providing the instrumentation, NOAA will operate the instrument and thus NOAA's need to acquire the unique services of the system integrator and software developer, Simpson Weather Associates (SWA).</p>
<p>The government knows of only one source Dr. Emmitt and Senior Scientist of Simpson Weather Associates (SWA). There are no other known alternatives to acquiring the services of Dr. Emmitt and Simpson Weather Associates for this first season of Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) investigations by NOAA. The consequences of not having these services would be the cancellation of the DWL operations since the end-to-end knowledge of the system is currently unique to SWA. Dr. Emmitt, President and Senior Scientist of Simpson Weather Associates, has been the Principal Investigator on two NAVY projects to develop and operate an airborne Doppler Wind Lidar on a Twin Otter (2002 - present) and a Navy P3 (2008). To our knowledge, these two Lidar systems are "one-of-a-kind" and are still being developed within Navy research programs. In addition to flying both DWLs in government sponsored research, including typhoon investigations (2008), Dr. Emmitt and SWA staff has, and continue to, develop unique proprietary software for the processing, display, and utility of the various data products derived from the Lidar returns. Dr. Emmitt is the only person known to be using the airborne DWLs to address some critical issues related to the atmospheric boundary layer beneath tropical cyclones. <br />Dr. Emmitt holds a current certification from the Navy survival training required for accompanying the DWL on NOAA P3 missions.<br />Simpson Weather Associates has several individuals who operate the DWL on the NOAA P3 (all have current survival training certificates), which train others in the operations.</p>
<p>To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their education, experience and capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service. Interested parties must respond within five (5) days after publication of this notice. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 816-274-6983 or physically sent Department of Commerce, Attn: Sharon Walker, 601 E. 12th St, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106. Email responses can be sent to Sharon.walker@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process. The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Clinical Pilot Adaptation of the Patient Tools System and QPD Software.  

Background
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Innovation Program is a cooperative effort between the health and Medical Information Office (CHIO/HMIC) of VHA's Office of Health Information (OHI) with VA's Office of Information and Technology to catalyze and support VA's next generation of Health Information.  VHA Innovation Program Goals are to provide tools, resources and processes that:  Encourage innovations to emerge from the field; Allow innovations to evolve based on collaborative constructive review, Provide a safe harbor for innovations to be piloted; and Vet Innovations from business and technical perspective.   

Requirements
The VA requirement is for an automated assessment system that provides a tool for patients to self administer critical clinical questionnaires in the waiting room.  The goal of this project is to improve patient care by having these questionnaires automatically administered, scored and results placed in CPRS notes that will be immediately available for the patient's provider.  This will give providers more time to review assessment results and provide education and treatment. This project will be completed using two contractors. The first contractor will be primarily responsible for the PD system, and they will upload due or selected questionnaires into the portable device, and download data collected and transform it in an HL-7 format. The second contractor will be responsible for developing the launch utility, storing the data collected by the PD system into the VistA/CPRS data files, and creating the CPRS notes for the patient's provider. 

Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of July 2, 2010 




1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work. Included in the statement please identify if your company can independently provide the entire range of services called for in the Statement of Work (SOW)? If your company can not provide all of the services can it provide some of the services? Please provide any recommendation on combining the requirements into one effort or splitting the requirement into two separate efforts. 

2.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
3.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
4.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Responses are requested no later than close of business on July 2, 2010, via email to  samantha.fletcher@va.gov and anne.vasconcelos@va.gov.

Registration deadline July 21, 2010. Hotelreservations should be completed by June 25, 2010.For workshop related questions, email ejsm.workshop@list.jpl.nasa.gov For SBIR related questions, email carol.r.lewis@nasa.gov or kimberly.e.graupner@nasa.govPurpose: The NASA Langley Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) office encouragessmall businesses with capabilities that mitigate high radiation environment risks andtechnologies that support planetary protection to attend the 4th Europa Jupiter SystemMission (EJSM) Instrument Workshop on July 26-29, 2010 in Universal City, California. The EJSM Workshop is an event organized by NASA and ESA to cover programmatic andtechnical aspects related to the EJSM mission for the instrument and business community. The SBIR office will attend the workshop and will be presenting information for smallbusinesses interested in responding to related topic areas within the upcoming NASA SBIRand STTR solicitations that would also be of great interest to the instrument community.The EJSM is a joint NASA/ESA mission to study the Jupiter System and its diverse Galileansatellites, utilizing two flight elements.  NASA is planning to build a robust radiationtolerant spacecraft, Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), to study the Jupiter System and itsmoon Europa.  ESA is planning a similar spacecraft, Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), tostudy the Jupiter System and its moon Ganymede.  The Jovian magnetic field isapproximately twenty (20) times larger than that of Earths.  The radiation environmentfor the JEO baseline mission concept is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID)behind 100 mil thick aluminum.	This level is seven times greater than any previous NASAmission.  The baseline ten (10) year mission requires that all electronic components behardened to a minimum of 100-300 kRad. The radiation challenges and long-duration demandstate of art spacecraft and design capabilities.  In order to assure mission success, thespacecraft must not only be radiation hardened, but also sterilized and remain so forplanetary protection.	The research and development areas that EJSM seeks to reducemission risks are the following:  radiation effects in parts, materials and sensors;spacecraft charging; planetary protection methods; instrument sensors and components;operational complexity; radioisotope power source; and mission lifetime. Two classes will be offered as part of the workshop: a tutorial on the Jovianenvironments, and Planetary Protection considerations for instrument development. Thisworkshop will provide relevant information to potential instrument teams who intend torespond to the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for EJSM instruments that is expected tobe released in 2011. It will also provide information to small businesses interested inresponding to related topic areas within the upcoming NASA SBIR and STTR solicitations.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to modify contract WC133R-07-SE-4904, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Freshwater Benthic Services for supplemental work within the scope of work in identifying Oligochactes and Chironomids from Lake Michigan and Lake Erie to include in its Mussel Watch Program an analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate structure.
<p>In the original statement of work and as part of a long term monitoring effort in Lake Michigan, a study to assess ecological impacts of hypoxia in Lake Erie, benthic organisms were collected over various time and space scales in both lakes. These organisms were counted and separated into various taxonomic groups at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). Two groups, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae need to be further identified to the genus or species level. Personnel at GLERL do not have the time and/or expertise to do the identifications. Mr. Winnell of Freshwater Benthic Services, Inc has been identifying Oligochaeta and Chironomidae for over 30 years and is especially familiar with species present in Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The long term monitoring project in Lake Michigan has been ongoing since 1980 and Mr. Winnell has provided identification of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae since the project was initiated. Both groups contain species that are excellent indicators of environmental change but only if identified to the genus or species level. Consistency in identifications is essential since any change in species composition must be regarded as a response to environmental conditions and not to the person making the identifications. Mr. Winnell has a unique knowledge of the species.</p>
<p>In 2009, the National Ocean Survey expanded its effort in Mussel Watch Program to characterize benthic macroinvertebrate communities in near shore areas of the Great Lakes. Over time, trends in communities will be evaluated relative to trends in legacy contaminants. Communities at the Mussel Watch sites are highly impacted by human activities and therefore dominated by pollution-tolerant forms within the taxonomic groups Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. To accurately assess trends in community structure relative to contaminants, organism within these two groups must be identified to the species level. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the identification of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in near shore areas of the Great Lakes may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (816) 274-6993 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with NUKA RESEARCH AND PLANNING GROUP, LLC, INCORPORATED, 3 JACKALOF BAY RD, SELDOVIA, AK 99663-0175 to provide Geographic Response Strategies for five sites along the Cook Inlet Coast for Lake Clark National Park & Preserve, Port Alsworth, AK 99650. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background:  Lake Clark NP&P needs additional GRSs (Geographic Response Strategies) to protect sensitive coastal resources in the event of an oil discharge event in Cook Inlet.  GRSs are detailed site specific plans to respond to oil impacts following a spill.    1. FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:
Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(B) Nuka Research is the only company with the proven experience in preparing Geographic Response Strategies in this area with the State of Alaska.  Market research was conducted and did not reveal another source to compete for this contract.
2. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:
Our plans will be incorporated with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Cook Inlet Subarea Contingency Plan.  GRSs are oil spill response plans tailored to protect a specific sensitive area from oil impacts following a spill. These response plans are map-based strategies that can save time during the critical first few hours of an oil spill response. They show responders where sensitive areas are located and where to place oil spill protection resources.  These documents can make a critical difference in the impacts of an oil spill event on sensitive park resources.
Prepare Geographic Response Strategies (GRS) for five sites along the Cook Inlet coast of Lake Clark National Park & Preserve (Figure 1).  New sites are mouth of Johnson River, Silver Salmon Creek meadows, and Shelter Cove.  Tuxedni Bay and Chititna Bay have existing GRSs, but need review and augmentation to adequately protect Lake Clark resources. GRSs are in place for the mouths of Polly Creek and Crescent River.  These sites are all in the Central Cook Inlet Subarea Contingency Plan. 
3. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc) :
Nuka Research has 10 years experience preparing GRSs for the south-central Alaska coast, and has developed over 300 GRSs which are incorporated into various State of Alaska Subarea Contingency Plans.  
4. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted. 
A Sources Sought Announcement was posted for 15 days.  Three companies submitted packages.  One company, Nuka Research, was the only company that met the required criteria provided in the Sources Sought

REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #25 is to obligate $32,167.00 for a targeted brownfields assessment (TBA) of the Main Street West End Project located in the town and County of Ellendale, North Dakota. The period of performance will be from the date of award (anticipated to be on 6/21/2010) through 12/30/2010. Requirements for TO #25 include the following: 1) contacting the On-site Coordinator (OSC) for site history, related documents and TBA planning; 2) participating in the kick-off conference call with the OSC, the contact in Ellendale, ND, and START to discuss TBA project goals and data needs; 3) developing a field sampling plan (FSP) for Phase II assessment; 4) conducting Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in compliance with the final "All Appropriate Inquiries Rule". ASTM E1527-05 "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process" may be used to satisfy this requirement; 5) conducting the Phase II assessment; 6) determining the clean-up options and associated cost estimates; 7) completing the property profile form (PPF); and, 8) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA" or "the Act"). The Act contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START are the most appropriate contract vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of ARRA.

Accordingly, the ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the POC listed for this solicitation. When requested the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman, Mr. Marks, may be contacted at (937)255-8642 or (937)656-7193 (FAX).

<DESC>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries. This research is parsed among three Offices: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe &amp; Secure Operations.  This BAA solicits proposals for the Office of Safe and Secure Operations.<br /><br />Information technology has qualitatively changed and continues to transform the intelligence enterprise. BAA 10-07 solicits research to enhance mission performance while assuring the security of information at rest and in motion. Examples include:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Computational methods based on architectures other than digital Turing machines whose attributes are matched to efficient or secure solution of intelligence problems. (e.g. optical, analog, biological, brain-based, quantum, or hybrid computing systems.)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; New approaches to secure transmission of information using optical, electromagnetic, digital packet, chemical, or biological signals. This includes synchronous and asynchronous communications, bandwidth-constrained digital transmission, and triage of large data flows.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Detection, classification, and mitigation of attempts by adversaries to manipulate electronic data or networked infrastructure.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Resiliency: approaches to operating securely with imperfect equipment and a compromised network. <br />
<p>Ideas that substantially enhance the safety or security with which information is collected, stored, analyzed, and disseminated are also encouraged, even if they do not explicitly involve information technology.</p>
<p>This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations.  It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs in the future, so periods of performance will generally not exceed 12 months.</p>
<p>Offerors should demonstrate that their proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements to intelligence capabilities.  Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Proposal (RFP) to CanberraIndustries, Inc., CT. to procure Environmental Continuous Air Monitors (ECAMs) in supportof the Mars Science Lab (MSL) mission as specified below.Fifteen (15) Alpha Beta ECAM units fully compatible with the existing stock of NASA ECAMunits. The ECAMs shall be equipped with Geographic Positioning System (GPS) capabilityand ECAM Alarm option to conform to existing NASA ECAM units, including detailed ECAMoperators manual.Quantity	Canberra Material Number	Description	15	00-6828-1.0	ASY ECAM GEN 3 MCA ALPHA BETA Environmental Continuous AirMonitor      15	00-6829-1.0	ASY ECAM ALARM Option	15	00-6681-1.0	ASY ECAM GPS OPTION				Freight 		Services:Activate Service Agreement for one (1) operating ECAMSet up RADCC Master site  install and initialize RadHawk ECAM software	Last item. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Canberra. It would take a substantialduplication of time and effort for another company to provide comparable ECAMs, and thosecosts are not expected to be recovered through competition.   Presently fifteen (15) of these ECAM systems are in use at NASA KSC. Monitoring unitsmust be able to communicate with the master control site at the Radiological ControlCenter.  The Canberra ECAM RadHawk software enables communication with the monitoringunit and a graphical user interface for querying each of the systems individually anddisplaying overall status of the network.  This software has also been customized toenable communications and data transfer with US Department of Energy monitoring databasewhich would be the primary source of radiological information for health and safetydecision-making in the event of a launch area accident.  Purchase of competing systemswould result in system incompatibility issues when all systems are used as a monitoringnetwork, and create additional work to duplicate the system modifications already madefor RadHawk.    Training, calibration and setup cost would have to be coordinated between 2 differentsuppliers, increasing cost of the service and time spent in coordinating the work.This is a unique radiation detection instrumentation system utilized to detect andmeasure air dispersion of radioactive material, created from a catastrophic event duringthe launch phase of spacecraft with radiation sources on board. Utilizing two differenttechnologies would make it more difficult to manage during a radiological emergencysituation.Choosing another vendor would introduce unacceptable delays in terms of time, and testingto ensure a combination of the two systems would be compatible and ensure missionsuccess.  Additional costs would also be incurred in coordinating performing andevaluating such a compatibility test.  Using another system would introduce unacceptablerisk that may lead to mission failure or undue public safety issues.The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 ofthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquirea commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their quotation or capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00p.m. local time on July  2, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsiblesources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman hasbeen appointed.

(xiii)  Sole Source justification:

Only the brand name specified will meet the Government’s need.  The US Department of   Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Indian Health Service, intends to award a purchase order to NextGate Solutions, Inc., located at 3579 East Foothill Blvd., Suite 587, Pasadena, California  91107.  HHS intends to purchase a software license from NextGate Solutions to assist in the implementation of the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) and to manage the Master Person Index (MPI) with a browser based interface.  These projects will help IHS modernize and extend electronic health information technology to improve access, quality, safety, and overall health status of American Indians and Alaskan Natives.  The NextGate software license will provide the management tools to help IHS achieve compliance with mandated federal requirements, including the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act, the AHIC-Interoperable Nationwide Health Exchange, the Federal Healthcare Architecture, and the HSPD12-HHS Identity associated with evolving criteria for Meaningful Use Electronic Health Record Certification provisions.  

NHIN is a set of standards, services and policies that enable a secure health information exchange over the internet.  NHIN ties together health information exchanges, integrated delivery networks, pharmacies, government, labs, providers, payers, and other stakeholders.  NHIN CONNECT is an open source software package that implements NHIN architecture.  Several federal agencies collaborated to build NHIN CONNECT to tie their health IT systems into NHIN, creating a single solution that can be reused by each agency and that meets federal regulations for health IT interoperability.  NextGate has adapted a functional core component for resell per a provision of NHIN CONNECT regulations.  IHS intends to purchase this product from NextGate because of this core competent modification.  Additional customization will be required with the Data Quality Manager included with the license to work in the IHS environment.  IHS has a unique environment that is particular to its Native American population and special reporting requirements.  NextGate is uniquely qualified for the following reasons:  They are currently developing the schema for IHS’ MPI project and, therefore, have gained valuable knowledge of IHS’ unique requirements and systems, including data fields, reports and protocols specific to the Native American population.  NextGate is currently working with IHS on other NHIN and MPI related projects that include the implementation of the NHIN CONNECT Health Information Exchange (HIE) and the Personal Health Record (PHR).  NextGate has worked with federal, tribal and contractor staff on these applications and have established relationships and communications among these various entities.  NextGate knows the challenges working with IHS, including the different types of healthcare facilities that IHS supports.  Health services are provided by IHS to federal, tribal and urban healthcare sites and range from large hospitals to small outpatient clinics in a complicated organization that are included in the MPI and NHIN implementation.  NextGate has comprehensive knowledge of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), a patient management database system based on the “M” programming language using Intersystems Cache database operating system that IHS uses exclusively at their medical facilities.  NextGate has developed messaging capabilities for IHS specifically interfacing between the NHIN, MPI, RPMS and IHS’ PHR.  NextGate can deliver the software in a timely manner so that IHS can accomplish goals and requirements prior to 9/30/2010.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><strong>Statement of Objectives</strong></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Cambria','serif'; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 14pt">1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-US">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-US">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or the Recovery Act) is an unprecedented effort to jumpstart our economy, save and create millions of jobs, and address <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>challenges so our country can thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ARRA is an extraordinary response to a crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With much at stake, ARRA provides for unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>As specified by the Recovery Act, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) was established to coordinate and conduct oversight of funds distributed under this law in order to prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and/or mismanagement. The RATB includes a Chairman, appointed by the President, and 12 Inspectors General (IG). The Board has a series of functions and powers to assist it in its mission of providing oversight and promoting transparency of the expenditure of funds at all levels of government.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ACCOUNTABILITY SECTION --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>RISK FOCUSED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The Accountability Section of the Recovery Board approaches the oversight function in multiple ways to stay at the forefront of fraud prevention for the American taxpayer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a more traditional mode, we take in tips from "citizen IGs" on our hotline service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since we stood the hotline up on September 28, 2009, we have received over 1,700 total complaints from the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These complaints come to us in many ways, including phone calls, fax, mail, and through our submission form on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.recovery.gov</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of these complaints, over 140 have been referred to the oversight community, the 29 Inspectors General that have responsibility under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The number of complaints is not uncommon for a hotline service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you consider other tip lines like this, you will find that only about 10% or less of the complaints are actually actionable information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The remainder include non-actionable information like threats, vulgarity, political statements, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In a more proactive mode, the Board keeps watch over the spending patterns, and more importantly, who's actually getting the funds at our Recovery Operations Center (ROC) located in Washington, DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have established never-before used methods to identify high-risk recipients of contracts, grants, and loans to help prevent fraud before it occurs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We do this by employing business rules commonly used in the financial industry to look for recipients that may be of concern based on factors like recent bankruptcies, excessive liens, judgments and lawsuits, lack of experience or history in a certain contract specialty, and other risk-relevant information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Special Programs Unit laid the foundation with regard to preventative efforts during our first year in existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This unit generated proactive issues by scouring public information and finding non-compliance issues that, in some cases, revealed more serious problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These issues ranged from simply not being registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (an ARRA requirement) to more complex concerns involving the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, the Special Programs Unit not only looks for non-compliance issues, but also actively searches for broader, more complex deficiencies to preclude non-authorized entities from getting Recovery funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 261.0pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">To explain more about our approach in the ROC, we have created a three-tiered system to address the overwhelming challenge of Recovery spending oversight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first-tier uses screening models (briefly described above) to get through large volumes of data to try and isolate potential high-risk recipients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This screening model makes us aware of publicly available information to help ensure the Federal Government is doing business with authorized entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As an example, the ROC analyzes risk-factors such as fraudulent business addresses, involvement in past criminal behavior, and whether or not the entity has been suspended or debarred from working with the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 261.0pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The second tier uses a link-analysis tool to uncover non-obvious relationships between entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, while it may be that "Company A" presents itself as a low risk recipient, they may have undisclosed ties to known criminal or high-risk entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, we do not want to allow Recovery funds to get into the hands of criminals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is here where we have directed our attention in employing a multi-talented Accountability Section staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have employed people with backgrounds in audit, investigations, procurement, program analysis, math, statistics, sociology, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We found the challenge of ferreting out potential fraud, given this volume of funding, requires an unconventional approach to prevention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having a multi-talented staff with diverse experience and educational backgrounds allows us to look at potential problems in many different ways, and then report those findings to the cognizant Inspector General office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 261.0pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Lastly, we use the results of the first two tiers (preliminary screening and link analysis), along with historical risk factors, and present-day trends to create risk-based resource management tools for the oversight community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, we create maps that depict counties across the U.S. that have been hardest hit by the recession (i.e., high foreclosure and unemployment rates).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We then overlay that information with Recovery.gov information to show where Recovery Act funds are flowing and correlate that data with previously identified high-risk programs (these programs were provided by the Inspectors General).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, we track where our hotline calls are coming from to look for trends in potential fraud and waste allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through this methodology, we aim to focus limited oversight resources where they are needed most across the Nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>In the end, we exist to bring the power of technology and analysis to the existing oversight community and give them a more focused view of Government spending and potential fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The challenge we face is in on a level that our Government has not previously known for a single appropriation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never before have we created, and then charged a single oversight Board with this amount of responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is our opinion that our efforts in fraud prevention and detection, coupled with our transparency initiatives will forever change the public's expectations of their Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Cambria','serif'; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 14pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Requirements</span></strong></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; mso-add-space: auto">The RATB currently uses a comprehensive risk-screening model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The RATB requires the use of a study designed to identify/enhance our efforts by revealing risk indicators available, but not currently being used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The study will show, in the form of a final report, the existence of risk variables that may be used in screening and assessment. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government expects the Offeror to conduct research and analysis on fraud indicators found in fully adjudicated investigations to find consistent fraud indicators that can be applied to the tremendously diverse types of spending with the Recovery Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is expected that a normal rule set will not consist of more than 15-20 rules, but the Offeror is not limited to that model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Offeror will provide a <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">solution that uses mathematical modeling to identify a set of characteristics which, based on mathematical regression analysis, are statistically proven to correlate to fraudulent activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is similar technology currently used within the credit granting industry to automate the process of granting credit, detecting fraudulent transactions and automating risk management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Experience and </span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">expertise working with large databases and employing mathematical algorithms to automate credit risk management for credit grantors is a key factor in providing a risk modeling solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The Feasibility Study (product of this SOO) must indicate how it is possible to automate, with great precision and accuracy, the process of identifying possible fraudulent activities related to Recovery Act contracts, grants, loans, and entitlements.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-US">The Offeror shall provide briefings to the government on the program during the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scope of these briefings shall be the progress and status of the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These presentations shall include presentations of all schedules as needed. </span></p>

<DESC>The Census Bureau serves as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy. We honor privacy, protect confidentiality, share our expertise globally, and conduct our work openly. We are guided on this mission by our strong and capable workforce, our readiness to innovate, and our abiding commitment to our customers.<br />As part of the process for producing quality data, The Census Bureau would like to enhance the value of the housing data produced from current surveys by obtaining foreclosure records for homes experiencing "mortgage distress" and appending this information to already existing surveys to understand better the characteristics of housing unit and the household members (in the case of occupied units). Providing this information would fill an important gap in knowledge that would help guide developing policy toward housing and housing finance.
<p>In Accordance with FAR Part 13(Simplified Acquisitions Procedures)&nbsp; The contractor shall provide a complete dataset of all housing units in Calendar Year 2009 that experienced some form of "mortgage distress". Housing units are considered to experience "mortgage distress" should one or more of the following events occur: <br />1. Receive a notice of default<br />2. Receive a notice of trustee sale, or <br />3. They become real-estate owned (REO - bank owned).<br /><br />If a particular housing unit experienced several different stages of mortgage distress in 2009 (and, thus, appears several times in the file), only the most recent stage reported is requested for the proposed foreclosure dataset. <br />Data Requirements<br />At a minimum, each record shall contain the following information:<br />a. Address of affected property<br />i. Street Address<br />ii. Apartment number (if a condo unit)<br />iii. City<br />iv. State<br />v. Zipcode<br />b. Name of borrower<br />c. Date of last action taken<br />d. Status of last action taken ( notice of default, notice of trustee sale, REO)<br />e. Property type (single family, condo, coop)<br />f. Loan amount<br />g. Date action recorded<br />h. Data action entered<br />i. Auction date - if applicable<br />j. Information about the housing unit<br />i. Number of bedrooms<br />ii. Number of bathrooms<br />iii. Square footage of house<br />iv. Number of stories<br />v. Year built<br /><br /><br />Retention: <br />The Census Bureau will retain ownership of the records.<br /><br />Deliverables and Milestone Schedule</p>
<p>Conduct post award telephone conference Within one week after award<br />Receive revised requirements (if necessary) Within one week after award</p>
<p>Receive foreclosure dataset One month after award</p>
<p>Two soft copies of the deliverable on a medium mutually acceptable to the Offeror and the Census Bureau shall be delivered or available via FTP downloand to the Census Bureau on the indicated date. The deliverables will be forwarded or made available via FTP download to the Assistant Division Chief for Housing Characteristics.</p>
<p>Travel Requirements</p>
<p>There are no travel requirements for this project.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience Required<br />The Offeror shall have detailed knowledge of and experience working with the foreclosure records that will enable the Offeror to provide the Census Bureau with the necessary data fields for each foreclosure record.</p>
<p>6. Performance Measures Will Include</p>
<p>a. Ability to produce as complete a set of unique foreclosure records as possible<br />b. Ability to produce the dataset in the timeframe specified<br />c. Ability to provide all the fields identified the information provided identified under "Data Requirements" in the "Scope of Work" section</p>
<p>&nbsp;Quotations must be submitted to Pamela Miller via email at <a href="mailto:pamela.a.miller@census.gov">pamela.a.miller@census.gov</a>. All questions must also be emailed to this address prior to July 2, 2010. No phone calls will be honored.</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide parts or approved alternates that satisfy all form, fit and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard's HH-65 aircraft. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X </span>52.216-27 Single or Multiple Awards (Oct 1995)<br />The Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or task order contract or to award multiple delivery order contracts or task order contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 12 JULY 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 14 JULY 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200146 in subject line.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 24 JUNE 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 28 JUNE 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200150 in subject line.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide parts that satisfy all form, fit and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard's HH-65 aircraft. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.<br />Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> 52.216-27 Single or Multiple Awards (Oct 1995)<br />The Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or task order contract or to award multiple delivery order contracts or task order contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 8 JULY 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 12 JULY 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200149 in subject line.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200152 is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41. <br /><br />It is anticipated that a sole source Firm-Fixed Price purchase order shall be awarded as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. It is the Government's belief that only Divers Den can obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Business concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. <br /><br />Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure their quote meets all the requirements identified herein. <br /><br />The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The USCG plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order for the following parts utilized on the Coast Guard's H65 Short Range Recovery (SRR) helicopter. This is an unrestricted solicitation. <br /><br />Item 1) NSN: 1680-01-HS1-7050<br />Part # 1B7858-4<br />CHIP DETECTOR, ELECT<br />Quantity: 20 EA<br />Cage: 97484<br />Delivery on or before 06/15/2011<br /><br />Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.&nbsp; Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 09 JULY 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 12 JULY 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200152 in subject line.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES</p>
<p>In accordance with procedures set forth in AFI 31-101_MWSUP 1 Oct 08:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Normal Installation Entry. Entry to MAFB requires possession and verification of approved identification credentials. Personnel without valid identification will be referred to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) located at the 2nd Avenue North Gate entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People who cannot be properly identified or sponsored will be denied entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Contractor Access:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon award of a contract, the contractor awarded the contract will be issued a request for a Contractor Entry Authority List (CEAL) by the contract administrator. Upon receipt, the contractor must compile the information required for the CEAL and submit a completed CEAL to the contract administrator. Until this occurs, no employees will be permitted to enter Malmstrom AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The contracting office approves the list and hand carries it to the Pass and Registration Section (341 SFS/S5B) for review. S5B personnel will compare the approving official's signature against a DD Form 577, <strong>Signature Card</strong>, or an appropriate letter on file at pass and registration. S5B then hand carries the submission to the 911 Dispatch Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A 911 dispatcher certified on the National Criminal Information Center system (NCIC) will run the contractor names through the NCIC for wants and warrants. The 911Dispatch Center will input all listed employees' names and data into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database for a background check in accordance with Air Force directives. Unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation, including, but not limited to, individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories: those having outstanding wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offenders, those who are on probation, and those who are in a pre-release program. The definition of sex offender and violent offender can be found at Montana Code Annotated &sect; 46-23-502. After the dispatcher completes the NCIC check, they will sign the letters and return them to S5B. Unfavorable results will be grounds for denial of entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor personnel requesting a contractor pass will provide a picture ID</p>
<p>to be verified against the Contractor EAL. Those employees, who clear the background check process, will be issued passes by S5B, located in Building 250, for the duration of the contract or one year, whichever period is shorter. For contracts lasting more than one year, including contract options, renewals and extensions, the contractor must repeat the above stated process on an annual basis. In addition, the process must be initiated for all new employees who are added to the CEAL after its initial submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Contractors are required to notify the contracting officer and S5B if an employee on a CEAL terminates his or her employment with the contractor or is involved in an incident that would result in unfavorable results from the background check including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4 above. If a contractor terminates an employee, it is incumbent upon the contractor to ensure that the employee's access badge is returned to the Pass and Registration office. If they are unable to retrieve the pass, they will contact S5B with the employee's information. S5B will then contact the installation entry control points and have them retrieve the pass if the person attempts to re-enter the base. In the case of a missile field contractor the S5B will contact Keys and Codes Control Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are contractor employees must use their contractor's pass when entering Malmstrom AFB for the performance of contract services. Under no circumstance will retired military members or dependents of active duty or retired military members vouch contractor personnel onto the installation utilizing their Armed Forces Identification Card. All DoD contractors who have been issued a Common Access Card will be allowed to sign people onto the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Violations of the stated entry procedures will be considered a breach of contract and the contracting officer will take appropriate action in accordance with the contract. Repeated or flagrant violations of this policy may result in termination of the contract for default.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor/vendor passes are for granting access to the installation for the sole purpose of employment. These passes do not permit access to or usage of government facilities or services (i.e., gym, service station, and dining hall.) However, during contractor/vendor "duty hours," the Burger King, Base Exchange Bowling Alley and Grizzly Bend Club eateries may be utilized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Local delivery companies (e.g., food, furniture, appliances) will submit a letter to the 341 SFS Pass and Registration Section containing the name of the company, the driver's name(s), date of birth, driver's license number and vehicle information. All information will be cross-checked against the installation barment and revocation list and the NCIC via the 911 Dispatch Center prior to approval. A copy of the letter will be maintained in the possession of the driver requesting entry. If the driver does not possess a letter, he/she will be directed to the VCC where an AF IMT 75, <strong>Visitor/Vehicle Pass</strong>, will be issued after verification of the delivery has been made through the on-base residence sponsor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or log, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center on Birth and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD), Division of Human Development and Disability (DHDD), Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program collaborates with federal, national, and state agencies and organizations in assisting states and territories to implement EHDI tracking and surveillance systems; assist states in enhancing EHDI infrastructure to improve their capacity to ensure that all infants are screened for hearing loss and receive appropriate follow-up services, as outlined in Goal 28-11 of Healthy People 2010; and maintain an information clearinghouse on issues related to EHDI that will be available through the CDC EHDI web site and teleconferences. Through these functions, the CDC EHDI program strives to ensure that newborns have the opportunity to communicate from birth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This program is a part of continuing national efforts to promote (1) early detection of hearing loss; (2) tracking of infants/children who are deaf or hard of hearing; and (3) the initiation of effective intervention systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These efforts are essential roles of the CDC EHDI program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Part of the CDC EHDI program mission is to support states in the development of tracking and surveillance systems and collect and maintain a database with aggregate hearing screening and follow-up data. Although this aggregate level data has enabled the generation of national estimates of hearing screening, diagnosis and enrollment in intervention, there are several limitations and questions that cannot be addressed with this data, which is why more detailed, pseudonymized, individual data is needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC><p>The roads at Table Mountain need as much road base as possible. The newer roads have developed some new potholes, and are getting ruts and washboards in them.

There are approximately 10 miles of road at Table Mountain that need basic maintenance and grading.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide as much road base as possible, while grading and shaping the full 10 miles of roads at the Table Mountain site. This includes spreading and compacting the road base, crowning the roads to facilitate drainage, shaping and cleaning out the barrow ditches along the roads, smoothing out washboards, and filling potholes.</p>
<p>The road base shall be applied to those areas of the road where it is most needed. These locations shall be reviewed and approved by the Table Mountain site manager.</p>

<RESPDATE>062510
<CONTACT>Katy Day, Contract Specialist, Phone 661-277-8216, Email kathrin.day@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>1. Industry Day is scheduled for an upcoming BAA titled <strong>"Liquid Rocket Engine Technology Development (LRETD)"</strong> on Wednesday, 30 June 2010. This BAA will include three (3) topics: <br />
<p><br />A. <strong>Green Advanced Spacecraft Propulsion (Green ASP)</strong> - AFRL's object of this program is to develop a thruster that will accommodate increased temperature and oxidation product environments to deliver predictable performance. Associated life and delivered thrust scaling as well as degradation algorithms are sought to support predictability of performance. AFRL is pursuing increased delivered energy density, decreased toxicity spacecraft chemical propulsion to support development and deployment of smaller logistical footprint, more easily deployable and mission capable spacecraft. AFRL has developed increased energy density, decreased toxicity monopropellant formulations relative to the current state of the art; however, the combustion environments are more demanding than state of the art propellants due to the increase in combustion temperature and oxidative product formation. Correspondingly, thruster component temperature and oxidation resistance requirements have increased relative to the state of the art as well. Thruster development to date, specific to AFRL developed advanced monopropellant formulations, has emphasized catalytic ignition. Development work has been focused upon a specific AFRL-developed monopropellant formulation applied to thruster design and support system (tanks, valves, regulators, control components, etc.) primarily for satellite missions. The desired conclusion of this program is a relevant demonstration of flight-like optimized components and of relevant mission duty cycles that support a flight-weight propulsion system design with defined performance and lifetime attributes. To achieve this end, the program design will rely on a phased approach 1) to understand thruster component materials requirements defined by combustion environment, degradation behavior, etc., and initialize algorithms describing these, 2) to map out delivered performance in a basic thruster configuration and derive initial scaling and degradition algorithms there from, 3) to optimize light-weight thruster development, to test performance and to validate developed algorithms, 4) and to demonstrate program performance goals and design for a proto-flight propulsion unit with supporting data analysis.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Health Assessment and Recognition Tools (HART)</strong> - The purpose of this topic is to solicit proposals for the development of innovative technologies in the field of liquid rocket engine health management. More specifically, the purpose of this topic is to develop sensors and sensor data algorithms that will enable oxygen-rich staged-combustion cycle reusable booster engines to achieve the Air Force operability goal for engine turnaround time. Solutions of particular interest include those that reduce or eliminate time-consuming ground inspections and/or maintenance actions. This topic has two (2) areas of interest; Turbopump Assembly (TPA) Application and Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA) Application.</p>
<p><br />C. <strong>Propulsion Unit for Cubesats (PUC)</strong> - Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB is interested in developing a propulsion module for precision maneuvering of very small spacecraft. Spacecraft typified by the emerging "cubesat" standard may provide a new paradigm for responsive spacecraft. Spacecraft with stowed volumes of between 1,000 cm3 and 3,000 cm3 massing approximately 3 kg for a variety of missions are advantageous for a variety of Air Force missions. One significant drawback of present cubesat technology is the lack of capable primary propulsion. Recent analysis performed at AFRL has determined that it is possible to increase total impulse capability dramatically over current state-of-the-art while remaining within a 1,000 cm3 envelope. Technologies of interest include both low and high thrust propulsion technologies.</p>
<p>2. Industry Day will be held in Bldg 8424,&nbsp;the Research Science Center&nbsp;at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Edwards AFB, CA. RSVP is required by COB Friday, 25 June 2010 to Katy Day via e-mail (Kathrin.day@edwards.af.mil). <br /><br />In your RSVP, you must include an approved copy of your company's Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, DD Form 2345. Otherwise, you will not be granted admission to the Industry Day. Additionally, standard visit authorization requests (VARs) must be submitted for each visitor to enable access to AFRL. VARs can be faxed or submitted via JPAS (insert JPAS code info-get from security). If you do not have access to JPAS, please submit the attached request form to James Singleton.&nbsp; <br /><br />JPAS submissions must use the following details:<br /><br />a.&nbsp; JPAS Account EB1MFB5R6<br />b.&nbsp; POC: James Singleton<br />c.&nbsp; Date: 30 June 2010<br /><br />Point of contact (POC) to coordinate VARs/Visit Requests&nbsp;is&nbsp;James Singleton (james.singleton@edwards.af.mil) for all topics. All VARs provided via fax must be signed by your organization's cognizant security officer and include their contact information. <br /><br />Access to AFRL will be granted for <strong>U.S. citizens only</strong>.<br /><br />All visit requests must be received by 25 June 2010, 4:00 pm (PST).</p>
<p>3. Tentative Industry Day Agenda:</p>
<p>0730-0800 Arrival/Security Check through gate<br />0800-0830 Opening Remarks<br />0830-0900 Business Information Briefing<br />0900-1030 Technical Information Briefings<br />1100-1630 Individual Q&amp;A Sessions</p>
<p>4. Individual Q&amp;A Sessions will be limited to 30 minutes per company. Q&amp;A sessions are available and will be reserved on a first-RSVP basis. Only one (1) Q&amp;A session will be allowed per company. If a company cannot attend Industry Day, the Air Force reserves the right to schedule a one-on-one telecom in lieu of an on-site Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>5. A map of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB, CA is provided for reference.</p>
<p>6. A DRAFT BAA will be added to this announcement prior to Industry Day that includes all three topics.</p>
<p>7. If you have any questions, please contact Katy Day, Contract Specialist via e-mail (Kathrin.day@edwards.af.mil) or phone (661-277-8216).</p>

The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 28 - July 1, 2010, at the Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give important information on procurement opportunities such as NextGen, Systems Engineering 2020, Electronic FAA Accelerated and Simplified Tasks (eFAST), Information Technologies Support Services (ITSS), EnRoute Automation Modernization System (ERAM), EnRoute Technical & Administrative Support Services (ETAS), National Airspace System (NAS) Implementation Support Contract (NISC), Mentor-Protg Program, power systems, terminal field operational support, engineering development services, safety and operations support, communications flight service and weather engineering, technology transfer, airport and aircraft safety R&D, quality standards,  research partnerships, operational support, security guard services (Federal Protective Service contracts consolidation), construction, airport modernization,  information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities infrastructure and security services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, architectural and training services etc.
The FAA annually obligates more than $3.5 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2009, the FAA awarded 29% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 9% to 8(a) certified firms, 12% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 2.2% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.

The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding prime contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA.
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops (i.e., SAIC, SRA International, Computer Sciences Corporation, Serco, Northrop Grumman, Deloitte, Apptis Inc., A3 Technology, Harris, ITT, Tremco Inc., Tetra Tech AMT, Lockheed Martin, Parsons, L-3 Communications, Raytheon, B3 Solutions, Veracity Engineering, ISSI, VMD Systems Integrators, Inc., Construction and Service Solutions Corp., CSSI, BancFirst, First National Bank, University of Oklahoma and many more.)

THE OFFICIAL POINT OF RECEIPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING TIMELY DELIVERY IS THE ADDRESSS PROVIDED FOR THE OFFICE OF ACQUISITIONS AS STATED IN ATTACHMENT 1, "PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF THE PROPOSAL." IF YOUR POPOSAL IS NOT RECEIVED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR HIS DESIGNEE AT THE PLACE AND TIME SPECIFIED FOR THE OFFICE OF ACQUISITIONS, THEN IT WILL BE CONSIDERED LATE AND HANDLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HHSAR CLAUSE 352.215-70, ENTITLED, "LATE PROPOSALS, AND REVISIONS" LOCATED IN SECTION L.1. OF THIS SOLICITATION."</p>
<p>(2) Attachment 1, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF THE PROPSAL, Section B. Proposal Submission, is hereby revised to read as follows:<br />In addition to electronic submission, one original and ten (10) copies of the technical proposal and one original and two (2) copies of the business proposal shall be provided to the address below:"<br />(3) Attachment 1, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF THE PROPSAL, Section C. Formatting and Layout, is hereby revised to include:<br />The technical and business proposal shall be submitted separately in two binders.<br />VENDOR QUESTIONS<br />1) We are a privately owned and operate with foreign funding. We have an established office in the U.S. and we are not a registered entity with the small Business Administration (SBA). Are we eligible to submit a proposal for this RFP?</p>
<p>Offerors must consider all requirements, provisions and clauses to determine if they are eligible to apply. Foreign businesses can propose (and they have successfully) on ARRA requirements; however, all appropriate provisions for selection that are related to foreign contracts (i.e., Buy American, Foreign Currency, Trade Agreements, Trade Sanctions, etc...) apply to the solicitation/selection process, and foreign businesses must meet all requirements of the solicitation. In addition to the foreign terms and conditions applying to the contract, the reporting requirements under ARRA must be met by the foreign business in performance of the contract. All offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) located at www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>2) Who will be the evaluators (academic, industry, fields....)?</p>
<p>The Technical Evaluation Group will be comprised of government and non-government experts qualified by training and experience in particular scientific or technical field.</p>
<p>3) What are the formal evaluation criteria and how will each be scored?</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria is listed in the RFP on page 74, Item 4, entitled &lsquo;Technical Evaluation Criteria. Please note, the criteria is listed in order of relative importance along with the assigned weight for each criteria.</p>
<p>4) What is the strategy in selecting projects to fund?</p>
<p>NLM will select projects to fund based upon the outcome of the technical evaluation, negotiations and the rules and regulation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>5) What level and type of justification is needed for fees for physician-consultants?<br />Justification should contain adequate documentation to support reasonableness of salaries proposed. For example: Proof that salary is commensurate with current or previous similar projects.</p>
<p>6) Will there be pre-award budget negotiations?</p>
<p>NLM anticipates that negotiations will be held with all contractors whose proposals are within the competitive range. However, the government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>7) What outcome of the work will qualify the project for follow-on funding or constitute feasibility and/or successful completion of the project resulting in extension or renewal of the contractor with the same contractor?</p>
<p>At this time, the National Library of Medicine does not anticipate any follow-up funding for this requirement. However, if follow-up funding does become available, a new solicitation will be issued.</p>
<p>8) Is it important to have a publishable paper at the end of the project or is a report to the NLM sufficient?</p>
<p>A publishable paper is not a requirement for this effort. At project completion, the deliverable required is a final report with details of achievement and potential for further development.</p>
<p>9) Is NLM trying to review a broad collection of technologies covering a broad set of application areas, or are you trying to assess some specific solutions to some more narrow problems?</p>
<p>NLM is interested in a broad collection of technologies for a broad set of application areas, but understands that specific proposals are likely to apply one or only a few technologies to a narrow domain.</p>
<p>10) Are "Human Subject Disclosures" required for the clinicians?</p>
<p>If tools in development are being tested on clinicians or human subjects, "Human Subject Disclosures" should be obtained. Contractors should check with their Office of Sponsored Research, if applicable, for their own policy as it relates to human subjects. Information on human subjects is also available at NIH's OHRP website. The following websites provide additional information regarding human subjects:</p>
<p>http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/<br />and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/ohrp_fda.htm</p>
<p>11) Does the proposed process or development agenda have to involve live subjects/ cases?</p>
<p>Offerors may propose any project that is within the scope of work. Live subjects are allowed but are not necessary.<br /><br />12) Is there a requirement to use data obtained from human subjects?</p>
<p>There is not a requirement to obtain data from human subjects. However, eventual applicability to <br />humans should be discussed.</p>
<p>13) If existing data is to be used, without involving human subjects, is it sufficient to state in the proposal that no human subject data was used, in order to be exempt from the human subject evaluation criteria?</p>
<p>If human data is not to be used, a statement to that effect is sufficient to justify exemption from human subject use regulations.</p>
<p>14) Is there a minimum number of records or data points required, in terms of establishing a result and achieving a minimum level of statistical significance, or can the project be based on a proof of concept with an initially limited data set?</p>
<p>A proof of concept with a limited data set is acceptable.</p>
<p>15) Is involvement by a MD required for a Principal Investigator on the academic side of the investigation team?</p>
<p>There is no requirement for a MD to be the Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>16) Do all technology pieces of the puzzle need to be sourced, identified and specified in the proposal or can there be a description of technology functionality, with part of the project involving development of that technology functionality as part of the project plan and specification?</p>
<p>There can be a description of technology functionality for which development is proposed. Offeror is responsible for providing sufficient detail to persuade that the approach is feasible.</p>
<p>17) In the proposal, can the focus be on one particular technology or approach? Is a narrow approach just as valid as a broad investigation of computational thinking?</p>
<p>A proposal can focus on a particular approach for a specific domain with no requirement that the approach will generalize to all other fields.</p>
<p>18) What are the exact deliverables for this project? What specifically would qualify as satisfactory completion of the work?<br />As stated in the solicitation, all offerors must submit a final report to the NLM that will be evaluated on the basis of feasibility of the approach, importance of the problem addressed, and potential for further development.</p>
<p>19) Will each funded project need a final demonstration to prove feasibility on a small scale? If so, when?<br />The final report, sent to NLM, should demonstrate feasibility of the project.</p>
<p>20) If we have an intriguing idea for a research project, will NLM help us find a data set that we can work on, or a partner in the biomedical field that we can partner with?<br />NLM is unable to assist offerors with data sets or finding partner organizations.</p>
<p>21) Is the proposed work to be performed onsite or offsite?</p>
<p>The place of performance for this requirement is offsite.</p>
<p>22) Page 1, section 9, says, "This solicitation requires delivery of proposals to two different locations..." I only see a Bethesda location. What is the other one?<br />As stated in Attachment I, all proposals shall be delivered to following address: 6707 Democracy Blvd., Suite 105, Bethesda, MD 20892. Page 1, Section 9, has been revised as follows: "This solicitation requires delivery of proposals to one location."<br /><br />23) On page 41, the RFP states that we have to make an explicit request if we want to retain copyright. Does that go in the Business Proposal? On page 41 it says, "permission [to establish a copyright] is normally granted provided, a paid-up, world-wide, irrevocable, nonexclusive license to the Government is provided. This is to advise offerors that for this project, the Government intends to assert additional copyright permissions under this contract." Can you give us a clue or an example of what such permissions might be?</p>
<p>The scope of the governments' interest in the copyright will be determined during negotiations.</p>
<p>24) On page 44 the RFP states that we need to address Section 508 accessibility concerns, and that "The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement." The only "Statement of Work" specifications that I found started on page 45 and in Attachment 3. These say nothing about Section 508 or accessibility. So, given this lack the question is: if we are proposing a deliverable that is essentially a prototype of a research tool, and therefore has only a very rudimentary user interface, do we need to address Section 508 in our proposal?</p>
<p>Effective June 25, 2001, the Federal Government implemented Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. S 794 (d)). Section 508 requires that the Federal Government only acquire electronic and information technology goods and services that provide access by persons with disabilities. For more information, please visit WWW.Section508.gov.</p>
<p>25) Does the assurance of less than 100% federal FTE commitment mentioned on page 46 need to be in writing, and if so, where -- in the Technical Proposal?</p>
<p>Yes, Offerors shall confirm that proposed personnel are committed less than100% by completing Attachment 6, "Summary of Related Activities".<br />26) Page 33 of the RFP describes the contents of the "first page" of the proposal. Is this the same page as the "COVER PAGE" of the proposal as described on page 39?</p>
<p>No, please refer to pages 33 and 39 for specific details as each page is separate. The cover page should be the cover of the binder and the "fist page" of the proposal is the first page of the technical and/or business proposal.</p>
<p>27) Is the NIH-2043 form supposed to be separate from the Technical and Business proposals, as implied on page 39, or is it an attachment to the Business Proposal as shown in Section J - List of Attachments?</p>
<p>NIH-2043 is a separate attachment that should be included with the Business Proposal as shown in<br />Section J - List of Attachments.</p>
<p>28) Is it OK to have the Certification by IRB review be pending? If a delay review is permissible, how do I indicate this on the Protection of Human Subjects form (OMB 0990-0263) and the Proposal Summary and Data Record form NIH-2043?</p>
<p>IRB approval is not necessary at proposal submission time but is required before contract award.</p>
<p>29) What is a reasonable way to budget for the PI travel to the quarterly meetings if we only know the location of the two meetings?</p>
<p>There will be one travel day allowed for each of 2 meetings in Bethesda. All expenses should not exceed the government per diem rate. Two meetings will take place by way of conference call.</p>
<p>30) Is there an award budget maximum? (We had heard $500K, however could not find any mention of a maximum in the solicitation.<br />NLM anticipates that awards for this requirement should not exceed $400,000.00.<br />31) Is it allowable for a firm to submit multiple proposals in response to the RFQ?</p>
<p>Yes, a firm may submit multiple proposals if each proposal is for different work as represented in a different approach to project administration.</p>
<p>32) In "Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award", subsection 2 and 3 are both titled "Evaluation Data Sharing Plan." What is the significance of these sections existing separately versus together in a single section?</p>
<p>This requirement will not require a Data Sharing Plan.</p>
<p>33) Is the estimate of 6,400 labor hours for a single proposal or the total pool available for all proposals which are awarded?</p>
<p>The estimate of 6,400 labor hours is for a single proposed project.<br />34) What is the expected number of awards the government intends on making?<br />As stated in the RFP, multiple awards are anticipated.<br />35) Was this solicitation released under a specific contract vehicle or rather as a stand-alone solicitation?</p>
<p>This solicitation is for a new requirement.<br />36) Is it possible that contractors continue to have billable hours to NLM if the project is successful? If the contractor successfully completes the project, would NIH consider an extension or renewal of the contract? If NIH intends to put out a subsequent project after this contract, when will it be?<br />NLM does not anticipate any follow on projects, at this time. A new solicitation would be issued for a new requirement.</p>
<p>37) Can an individual consultant work for this task while he or she works for other NLM project as an in-house contractor?<br />Yes, however, no individual may commit to work exceeding 100 % level of effort as described in Attachment 6, "Summary of Related Activities".</p>
<p>38) We are a small company, how do we prove that we are a qualified small business source?<br />It is federally mandated that organizations wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded the contract. If you already have a DUNS number, you can register on-line at http://www.ccr.gov by clicking on "Register in CCR." If you need a DUNS number follow the instructions at http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.aspx. Further information regarding registration is available in the CCR handbook at www.ccr.gov/handbook.aspx. If you experience problems with your registration, please contact the CCR help desk at 888-227-2423. Please note there is no cost to vendors for registering in CCR. One's CCR registration in no way guarantees winning a contract or an increase in business.<br />Also, organizations must complete ORCA certification. The Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) website can be found at: http://www.bpn.gov and clicking on "Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)" on the left side of the screen. The following items are required in order to submit your Reps &amp; Certs: (1) An active record in CCR, (2) An MPIN from that active CCR record. More information about ORCA can be found in the ORCA Handbook at: https://orca.bpn.gov/miscl/ORCA%20Handbook.pdf.</p>
<p>Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.</p>

If you need a DUNS number follow the instructions at http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.aspx. Further information regarding registration is available in the CCR handbook at www.ccr.gov/handbook.aspx. If you experience problems with your registration, please contact the CCR help desk at 888-227-2423. Please note there is no cost to vendors for registering in CCR.

<p>The descriptions in the electrical scope provide enough information (other than manufactures) that our normal vendors may assume they would provide pricing -We were involved in almost all of the original projects for East Grand Forks Levee's - and this equipment was provided by the government on those projects.<br /><br />Is it correct to assume that we are to just "install" the government provided equipment and "provide and install" the conduits and wiring to these controllers and electrical panels - and the government also "provides" final testing and systems check out with SIPAR.<br /><br />The scope for the pumps (2.0) indicates "new government furnished equipment" - that statement is not evident in regards to the pump starters. Other than in the plan sheets. Please advise.</p>
<p><strong>Government Response:<br /></strong>The plan sheets provided for K1 and L8 including drawings 64/1638 and 64/1969 are provided for reference only. These drawings show the as-built condition of the stations at the completion of construction. These drawings do not indicate the requirements for this new contract.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the control panel, motor starters, wiring, floats, and all conduit required for the new third pump installations at K1 and L8. The requirements for these features are stated in the scope of work. These are not Government furnished items.</p>

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5), Special Surveillance Programs Office (SSPO) develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, Electro-Optical, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and persistent surveillance systems. The purpose of these sensors and surveillance systems is to support a variety of OCONUS Contingency Operations (OCO) missions for persistent surveillance. The objective is for rapid turn-around research, development and prototyping to demonstrate advanced sensors/payloads for persistent surveillance. In an effort to advance AIR-4.5's research and development in these fields, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N68335-10-R-0009 (titled Persistent Ground Surveillance System Technologies and Payloads) was issued to address applications for tethered unmanned platforms, as well as unmanned airborne platforms. This BAA includes the sensors, sensor data processing and sensors systems, modeling of the sensor, communication techniques between the sensors and/or platforms, interfaces, the fusion and exploitation of multi-source sensor data, advanced payload platforms and its integration with sensors/payloads and any other technique to develop advanced capabilities and to reduce the cost of transitioning sensor/payload technologies into theater.
<p>The&nbsp;awarded effort is to support AIR-4.5 research and development sensor technologies program by developing Advanced Land Radar Processor (LRP) Sensor payloads that support persistent ground surveillance with mobile systems, aerostats, and remote deployed expendable systems. The system will be capable of providing real-time, networked 360&deg; detection, tracking, and cueing of walking humans and vehicles with land clutter and false alarm rejection. Building upon existing COTS production components and research from previous Government programs, Vista Research, Inc. (VRI) will provide lightweight, compact, modular LRP payloads that can be used on mobile platforms and tethered aerostats. <br /><br />This award is issued off a Braod Agency Announcement (BAA), N68335-10-R-0009, and will be&nbsp;a 37 month Cost Plus Fixed Fee Effort.&nbsp; This is the most appropriate type of contract, since&nbsp; there are uncertainties and risks associated with a research and development contract.&nbsp; CPFF provides the Government control of delivery schedule, ease of redirection of effort, and emphasis on performance objectives.</p>

This opportunity was available only to ResCare, Inc. under contract number DOLJ09UA00026. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $4,000 to the Homestead Job Corps Center, operated by ResCare, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

The operator of the Homestead Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>HHSM-500-2010-00106P
<DESC>Two CMS Program Offices, the Center for Drug and Health Plan Choice (CPC) and the Quality Measurement and Health Assessment Group (QMHAG), use the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) System as an integral part of their risk adjustment methodology for calculating payment for health plans and hospital quality of care measures for public reporting respectively.
<p>Section 4001 of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement a risk adjustment methodology that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status and other demographic factors for payment. In response to this BBA mandate, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) contracted the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to develop the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) System to support the risk adjustment methodology in 2004. The purpose of the HCC algorithm is to group patient diagnosis codes on claims to define patient risk factors for risk adjustment. The CMS HCC algorithm first assigns 15,000+ ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to 804 groupings ("Dx Groups") and then subsequently aggregates them into 189 clinically relevant categories. In 2006, the Center for Drug and Health Plan Choice (CPC) contracted the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to maintain 70 of the 189 HCC elements for use in the payment methodology for the Medicare Advantage plans.</p>
<p>The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 requires hospitals to submit quality measure data to CMS in order to receive full annual payment update (APU) of the services provided. The Act further requires that CMS make the measure data available to the public. Given the MMA authority, CMS established the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) Program that collects, validates and posts the hospital quality measures on Hospital Compare. The MMA requires hospitals to submit data on 10 "core" Process of Care Measures; the DRA of 2005 expands the domains of quality measures to include Structure, Patient Satisfaction and Outcome/Efficiency. In compliance with the DRA requirements, QMHAG developed six Hospital Outcome/Efficiency Measures for the following topics: the 30-Day Mortality and Readmission Measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure (HF) and Pneumonia. These measures use all 189 clinically relevant HCC for the risk adjustment models. To meet the RHQDAPU Program needs, QMHAG is required to update the 189 HCC elements yearly to calculate the Outcome/Efficiency Measures.</p>
<p>This contract will acquire RTI's expertise to build on and expand the maintenance work that RTI conducts under the contract with CPC (for the 70 HCCs) to include all 189 HCCs which are used by QMHAG.</p>

<DESC>Brand Name Justification
Posted after Award in accordance with Section 844 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 - FAR 5.406 and 6.305


1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans Affairs
Austin Information Technology Center (AITC)
1615 Woodward Street
Austin, TX 78772

Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs
Center for Acquisition Innovation-Austin
1701 Directors Blvd., Suite 600
Austin, TX 78744


2.	Nature and/or description of the action:  
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Information Technology Center (AITC), requires increasing memory in 18 existing Sun SPARC T5440 servers.  The servers are currently configured with two (2) CPU modules each (1.4GHz-8C) and a total of 32 GB memory (eight (8) Fully-Buffered, Dual In-line Memory Module (FBDIMM), 4GB, 2Rx8, 667).  The servers are under a five year Platinum Hardware Maintenance Contract (Contract #:  US1070153, over the period: 10/29/2009 - 10/28/2014)

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:

Sun Microsystems 144 each - 8 GB RoHS-6 Memory Expansion Kits (2*4GB) comprised of:
"	Two (2) low-profile FBDIMMs with memory size 4GB
"	FBDIMMs labeled with Sun part number:  SESX2C1Z
"	DDR2-667 Memory Modules (to match current memory modules in the existing systems).

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as further detailed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:

The use of the Sun specific labeled memory is essential to the Government's requirements, and thereby precludes consideration of products manufactured by other companies.  Third-party memory is not supported under the five-year maintenance contract already in place for these systems and would void Sun's responsibility for maintaining the systems on problems where memory is directly or even indirectly related.  Sun feels they put their memory through extreme testing and have their manufactures make changes to the info burned into the memory modules which make it unique for their particular servers.  Only the Sun brand memory will satisfy the Government's requirements and those contract holders who offer this type of support service will satisfy the need.

6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:

This requirement will be solicited on NASA SEWP in accordance with VA policy, allowing many resellers to compete for this requirement.

7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:
The SEWP contracts are FAR Part 12 Commercial Contracts, and additional price analysis was done in accordance with the following: The price design for SEWP is a proposed discount off the offerer's commercial list price. Price analysis was conducted in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1), to ensure that a "fair and reasonable" price is paid by the Government. 

Reasonableness of proposed prices was established in accordance with 15.403-1(c)(1)(i)(B) which provides that a price is based on adequate price competition if two or more responsible offerers, competing independently submit priced offers that satisfy the Government's expressed requirement and there is not any finding that the price of an otherwise successful offer is unreasonable. To verify price reasonableness, offerers were instructed to submit their published price catalog or published schedule of list prices in a form regularly maintained by the manufacturer or offerers, such as a catalog, price list, schedule, or other verifiable and established record. Additionally, each contractor proposed a discount off of product categories (such as input-output device) of IT equipment. 

These discounts remain for the life of the contract. Therefore, when new technology is added or list prices change due to market fluctuations, the SEWP price remains fair and reasonable. 

There are several other price reasonability checkpoints in SEWP: 
"	A SEWP Prime Contract Holder cannot offer prices higher on their SEWP contract than is offered on their GSA contract. This is exclusive of the surcharge. Since the SEWP fee is 0.5% compared to GSA's 0.75% fee, SEWP prices must be lower than GSA for that Contract Holder. 
"	When items are added or prices updated on a SEWP contract, prices are automatically compared to other SEWP contracts and must be within a reasonable price of all other contracts. Further comparisons with GSA, commercial and other contracts may be done to verify any questionable pricing. 
"	All SEWP Delivery Orders are subject to Fair Opportunity. This internal competition provides an incentive for Contract Holders to provide the best possible price in order to be selected for award. 


8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:

This item is widely available on NASA SEWP and GSA Schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov/ and https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advgsa/advantage/main/, it can be shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement.

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:

N/A

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:

N/A

11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:

Solicitations for future requirements may utilize "brand name or equal" language, if it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  The current requirement must be solicited using a brand name description because the Government needs to install supported memory that meets the technical requirements within the servers and meets requirements as defined within the VA's contracted maintenance/support contract.
