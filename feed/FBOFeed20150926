<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to provide for Real Property Planning and Analysis System (RPLANS) in support of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) located in Washington, D.C.  The period of performance is 09 September 2015 through 08 September 2016, with two one -year option periods.  RPLANS provides the Army with an automated planning system that generates facility allowances by location for the current year and six planning years based on units and population assigned using space planning criteria, algorithms and business rules.  RPLANS supports master planning efforts at all levels, including Army Installations, Installation Management Command (IMCOM), Army National Guard (ARNG), United States Army Reserves (USAR), Army Materiel Command (AMC), and Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA).  Users at each level share a common need to correlate real property assets with facility requirements to estimate excesses and deficits at each Army location.  The deficits are used to justify and prioritize new construction projects for the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and excesses are used to support re-purposing and demolition decisions.  The objective of this requirement is to provide maintenance and updates to the RPLANS system and database, RPLANS user training, technical assistance with using the system and submitting edits, preparing and updating system documentation, unique data requests that are not available in standard reports, and conduct technical analysis to develop and update systematic algorithms and conduct quality assurance of data for multiple existing data sources to ensure that data is current and accurate.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to provide the necessary RPLANS support.  <br>  <br> Solicitation W9124J-15-R-0018 will be competed as a HUBZone set-aside.  NAICS 541512 (Size Standard: $25.5M) applies to this procurement.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal.  <br>  <br> The RFP will be posted to ASFI/FedBizOpp on or about 17 July 2015 with proposals due on or about 31 July 2015.  These dates are subject to change.  All amendments to the solicitation will be likewise posted on this website.  Contractors are cautioned to check the website periodically for amendments. Solicitation mailing list will not be compiled and amendments will not be sent out in paper copy.  <br>  <br> All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management database (SAM.gov) to be eligible for award of a contract.   <br>  <br> Faxed offers and amendments will not be accepted.  <br>  <br> A question period will be opened at time of solicitation.  <br>  <br>

Due to the anticipated volume of proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs to those that are not selected for award. Instructions for preparing a presentation will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for an oral presentation does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.   <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the Government's goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $15.0M respectively.  Selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by other than small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at http://www.usace.army.mil/HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness.aspx provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate. <br>  <br> Points of Contact:   <br> Procedural Questions - ESTCP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565. <br> Technical Questions - ESTCP, Dr. Andrea Leeson, 571-372-6565. <br> Contract Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420.  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan - HECSA Small Business Representative, HECSASmallBusinessProgram@usace.army.mil or 703-428-7385.  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at <em>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions</em>. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 8, 2013. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $4.5M respectively. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office website at <em>www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb</em> provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>THIS IS ONLY A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for cable services on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.</p>
<p>The proposed sole source will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed-Price contract to Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC for cable services. The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is FAR 13.501(a)(2)(i) as it is believed that only Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC has been granted the authority under the existing cable service franchise agreement to provide cable services to all residents on the Fort Bragg installation that request service.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited quotes or proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code(s) is: 517110, "Wired Telecommunications Carriers." Size Standard - 1,500 Employees.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Identify any condition(s) or action(s), which may adversely affect unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solutions. Provide a description of the requirement; state that the requirement is a sole source synopsis to Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC; provide the Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center- Fort Bragg point of contact (POC) associated with the requirement; and provide the specific aspects, which unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>2. Provide name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, NAICS code, business size identification (large business or small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status, to include socio-economic status/certifications(s), such as, SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB.</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor. If subcontracting, identify any joint ventures or teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>4. Provide information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, which will facilitate in making a capability determination. Contractor shall clearly demonstrate they have the proper agreements and/or partnerships, training, and ability to provide basic cable services.</p>
<p>5. Provide information to help determine if the requirement (item or service) is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties.</p>
<p>6. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition, including competition among small business concerns.</p>
<p>7. Provide recommendations to improve the Army's approach for acquiring the identified items/services.</p>
<p>Please provide these responses, via email, no later than close of business on 28 September 2015.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Stacey Swader Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4825 Email: stacey.l.swader.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f).

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Is the unit price you are requesting our per visit price?  Or are you looking for a per set-up price?  RCP visits for the initial ventilator set up can be from 14-16 visits in the first month.  If you are looking for a per set-up price I suggest you have a separate line item for ventilator set-up and a separate line item for Tracheostomy set-up.  Ventilator set-ups are much more costly.

Government Response #24:  0025- Includes ALL new setups. The contractor shall follow The Joint Commission standards applicable to Home ventilator equipment setup.

An example of this is the patient's FIO2 must be less than 40%, stable trach and patient. The patient will need caregiver support based on patient need.

Government Response #27:  Medically stable patient with a secure artificial airway, be adequately oxygenated at less than an FIO2 40%, and able to maintain adequate ventilation on standard ventilator settings.

The Government will consider each offeror's demonstrated current (within 4 years) record of performance as a prime contractor in supplying services and products of the contract's requirement. Past performance is rated using an acceptable or unacceptable a noted in the chart below.
Past Performance Evaluation Ratings
Rating	Description

Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's submitted surveys, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.
Question #33:  The Past Performance Evaluation Ratings are very vague and confusing.  It almost appears that someone with no past performance would be considered acceptable.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Trimano Support Arm acts as the surgical team's third hand" by securely and safely holding the patient's arm in the desired positions during arthroscopic and/or open shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position.  This device can attached to any OR table / existing beach chair equipment.  No additional power or air connections are required.  The patient's arm can be moved in multiple directions by pressing the Trimano Support Arm's handle.  Releasing the handle locks it into the desired position.  This system eliminates the need for a support person to hold the patient's arm, thereby reducing inefficiency of OR support staff and technical errors that would adversely impact patient safety.  An associated kit includes a sterile drape for the Support Arm, foam arm holder, and Coban.  


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

This device is compatible to the beach chair equipment and any OR table that is currently used at Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Other manufactures did not offer spring load equipment.  Other devices would need hydraulic gas pressure and foot pedals to operate.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
This device can attached to any OR table including the existing beach chair equipment that is used at CNVAMC.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
