Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>The Government anticipates the extension of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. This acquisition modifies the IBCS development contract W31P4Q-08-C-0418 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NG) to procure hardware/materials under the terms &amp; conditions in the original contract. This Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract bridging modification will include the following: laboratory hardware for four Contractor System Integration Laboratory (CSIL) lines to support SW development for the Limited User Test and cyber compliance; hardware for three Government System Integration Laboratory lines to support System of Systems (SoS) Test and Integration activities; four Engagement Operations Center (EOCs); 61 Enhanced Plug and Fight Processing Unit (ePFPU) hardware, and hardware spares. The estimated period of performance will be 31 January 2018 through 31 March 2019.
<p>The Government anticipates this effort to be awarded on a sole source basis to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, 213 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL 35805-1958, CAGE 9F909. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B); however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and sole developer for the IBCS. The IBCS is still in the EMD phase, as such, NG maintains the knowledge, skilled labor force, and detailed technical data concerning the manufacturing processes, system operations, and detailed software/hardware designs necessary to perform the critical engineering and integration activities associated with the IBCS. A technical data package is not available at this time.</p>

<p>This order for brand name maintenance, to be performed November 01, 2017 through January 31, 2018, will be placed on a sole source basis with McKesson Technologies LLC as the following circumstance in FAR 13.106-1 (b) applies: only one source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized.

<p>Delivery of maintenance service will occur November 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018.</p>

The magnitude of construction for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. This magnitude range is required in accordance with FAR 36.204 and is not the government's estimate.

The overall objective of this early industry involvement is to enable the Government to reduce FFG(X) risk by maturing industry designs to meet the FFG(X) capability. The Government intends to award multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>FFG(X) will provide Combatant and Fleet Commanders a uniquely suitable asset to achieve select sea control objectives and perform maritime security operations while facilitating access in all domains in support of strike group and aggregated fleet operations. In terms of the Navy's Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) Concept, the FFG(X) small surface combatant will expand blue force sensor and weapon influence to provide increased information to the overall fleet tactical picture while challenging adversary Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking (ISR&amp;T) efforts. The purpose of this type of ship is to: (1) fully support Combatant and Fleet Commanders during conflict by supplementing the fleet's undersea and surface warfare capabilities, allow for independent operations in a contested environment, extend the fleet tactical grid, and host and control unmanned systems; and (2) relieve large surface combatants from stressing routine duties during operations other than war.</p>
<p>This platform will employ unmanned systems to penetrate and dwell in contested environments, operating at greater risk to gain sensor and weapons advantages over the adversary. FFG(X) will be capable of establishing a local sensor network using passive onboard sensors, embarked aircraft and elevated/tethered systems and unmanned vehicles to gather information and then act as a gateway to the fleet tactical grid using resilient communications systems and networks.</p>
<p>The competitive solicitation intended for release in November 2017 will provide for Conceptual Design (CD) in accordance with the Government developed FFG(X) System Specification. All technical requirements are defined in the System Specification and other Government Furnished Information (GFI) which will be provided as part of the solicitation. All future FFG(X) ship construction shall be conducted in a U.S. shipyard. In order to be eligible for CD, offerors must have a parent design from which to start. A parent design is defined as a design of a ship that has been through production and demonstrated (full scale) at sea. Offerors will only be allowed to submit one proposal as a prime contractor, and each prime contractor will only be eligible for a single award. However, offerors may be subcontractors under a prime in multiple proposals.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are advised that, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5230.24, certain FFG(X) technical data will be marked Distribution Statement D - Distribution authorized to DoD and U.S. DoD contractors only, and classified up to the SECRET level. Attachments to the solicitation which are marked Distribution Statement D will not be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website but will be made available according to instructions in the Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p>All potential offerors seeking access to the Distribution D and classified attachments to the RFP must completely fill out the "RFP Classified and Distribution Controlled Material Request Form," prior to receipt of said attachments via courier or FedEx.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, the offeror must have a SECRET facility clearance by time of award. Foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. However, the export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis. This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, or a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopsis. The information contained herein is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit inquiries/questions for consideration. Inquiries/questions concerning this announcement may be e-mailed to Lawrence Gordin (lawrence.gordin@navy.mil) and Kelli Bryan (kelli.bryan@navy.mil). The Government does not commit to provide a response to any comment or question resulting from this synopsis.</p>

<span><span>
<p><span>One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />This action will establish a new single-award indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) commercial item contract (pursuant to FAR part 12 <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Acquisition of Commercial Items</span></em> in conjunction with FAR part 15 <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Contracting by Negotiation</span></em><strong> </strong>and section 16.504<em> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Indefinite-quantity contracts</span></em><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">)</span>, for specific emergency escape mask respirators and their respective consumable components, using a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract type, with one base year and four Option years. The total estimated value is $35,000,000.00, which will represent the IDIQ contract maximum value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That value is based on an independent Government estimate using estimated purchase quantities for the base and all option years, (plus reasonably foreseeable amounts for contingencies), and historical as well as commercial list pricing identified through market research.&nbsp;<br /></span>&nbsp;<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented at FAR subsection 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and substantiated by a Justification and Approval, which shall be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days after award as required by FAR subpart 6.305. The anticipated sole source is ILC Dover LP (DUNS 187266259), 1 Moonwalker Road, Frederica, DE, 19946-2080. The basis for limiting competition is as follows:</p>
<p>1. ILC Dover part number 6000-11300-01 - SCape CO/CBRN30 Air Purifying CBRN Escape Respirator with Carbon Monoxide protection, Adult: NIOSH, under authorization of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, provides a testing, approval, and certification program assuring respirators used in the workplace meet the standards of 42 CFR Part 84.  NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the Certified Equipment List here: https://www2a.cdc.gov/drds/cel/cel_form_code.asp. The ILC Dover SCape CBRN30 Air Purifying Escape Respirator is the only NIOSH-certified respirator to hold a 30-minute protection rating and to provide carbon monoxide protection, as required by the Department.  Therefore, no other supplies will satisfy the Department's requirements for the CBRN/CO escape respirators and ILC Dover, as the manufacturer and sole distributor of that product, is the only responsible source.</p>
</span></span>
<p>2. ILC Dover part number 6000-10435-01 - SCape CBRN30 Air Purifying Escape Respirator, Adult: Due to the diversity of the Department worldwide, the Department requires a respirator that will fit the widest array of people possible with the easiest manner of use.  The oversized hood of the ILC Dover SCape CBRN 30 product line accommodates the greatest spectrum of head sizes, hairstyles, facial features, and in some instances cultural norms or any product on the market.  Other commercially available escape respirators require users to draw air through a carbon filter bed, which creates an unnatural resistance/restriction during both inhalation and exhalation.  This additional resistance causes difficulties for people with pulmonary deficiencies, asthma, and other lung compromising health problems.  The SCape CBRN 30 product line causes no increase in breathing resistance due to the overpressure of the hood provided by the automatic blower system.  The SCape CBRN 30 product line is currently also the only available NIOSH escape respirator that uses an automatic electric blower system to overpressure the respirator hood.  The other product that has received a 30 minute certification from NIOSH requires the wearer to inhale and exhale through a nose cup, which is unacceptable for the Department's needs.  That configuration creates an increase in breathing resistance and is not optimal for personnel with facial hair.  For the purpose of the DS/PSP/WMD Escape Respirator program the SCape CBRN 30 product line is required because it provides a positive stream of air into the hood effectively eliminating breathing resistance.  The SCape CBRN 30 product line design yields the lowest level of carbon dioxide build-up when used by people with facial hair or facial deformities. Additionally, the design of the SCape CBRN 30 product line allows the respirator to be used the most effectively in a stressful emergency situation with very limited operator familiarization.  This particular feature is required by the Government because the proper operation of the respirator is the least dependent on operator training, knowledge and skill.  This fact was illuminated during previous market research where it was identified that an untrained user could mistakenly wear the respirator backwards, yet evacuate the facility effectively.  Based on the results of our market research, the SCape CBRN 30 product line is the only product for which the user does not have to adjust fit by means of straps or other user operable/adjustable components.  The simplicity of using the respirator is critical to the continued success of the DS/PSP/WMD Escape Respirator program.  Other escape respirators depend on the user to fit a nose clip and adjust head straps for the escape respirator to be effective.  The SCape CBRN 30 product line simply requires the user to remove it from its package and pull the hood over the head to be protected, which is critical to the effectiveness of the program.&nbsp;The SCape CBRN 30 product line is the only NIOSH-certified respirators that does not require the use of a nose cup (oral/nasal cup) or mouth bit to ensure exhaled carbon dioxide is evacuated out of the hood.  The fact that the mask does not require a nose cup allows the escape respirator to fit the widest array of people, because the nose cup design requires a snug fit on the face to properly function.  The nose cup-based design, used on the other NIOSH approved respirator that has a 30 minute rating, will not fit all personnel equally because of differences in facial features (including facial hair) and head sizes.  This is unacceptable for the Department's needs.  Exhaled air that escapes the nose cup and enters the hood of the respirator can build to levels than could cause extreme discomfort and a feeling of anxiety or suffocation.  The positive air pressure in the SCape CBRN 30 product line forces the exhaled carbon dioxide to exit the respirator through the exhalation valve.  <br />Finally, the SCape CBRN 30 product line is the only NIOSH-certified respirators that presents minimal contact between rubber products and the users' faces, required for personnel who have a sensitivity to rubber products, and also provides the largest viewing area of all NIOSH-certified respirators (greater than 35 sq inches).  The viewing area is essential to safe evacuation during an emergency and the Department requires the largest viewing areas possible.  The viewing area, combined with the clear hood material of the SCape CBRN 30 product line, allows for a full 360 degree view of the person wearing the respirator and most importantly allows for the complete facial recognition by security personnel because there are no obstructions to the wearer's face.  The use of a nose cup and opaque hood material on the other NIOSH-certified 30 minute escape respirator limits the ability of security personnel and coworkers to quickly identify the wearer in an emergency, which is required by the Department for security and health safety reasons.  The SCape CBRN 30 product line is currently the only device that offers an unobstructed view of the wearer for identification or verification in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>3. ILC Dover part number S-5000-04W/ALK - Sentinel XL CBRN Powered Air Purifying Respirator with integral alkaline battery pack in backpack and spare alkaline battery pack: As evidenced on the NIOSH Certified Equipment List, the ILC Dover Sentinel XL CBRN Loose Fitting Hood PAPR is the only CBRN PAPR device certified by NIOSH to the CAP-2 level, as required by the Department.  Therefore, no other supplies will satisfy the Department's requirements for the CAP-2 CBRN PAPR device and ILC Dover, as the manufacturer and sole distributor of that product, is the only responsible source.</p>
<p>4. ILC Dover part number S-2016 - CBRN Filter Cartridges (Pack of 3), for Sentinel XL: Due to the complex scientific nature and proprietary design of the ILC Dover Sentinel XL CBRN Loose Fitting Hood PAPR, only ILC Dover replacement filter cartridges will function properly in the ILC Dover device. Further, ILC Dover filters are the only filters NIOSH-certified for use with the Sentinel XL product.  When NIOSH certifies a respirator, the filters are tested with it and the result is considered a system.  Other filters might fit and possibly function to some extent, but because they were not certified together as a system, they would not meet the requirement for NIOSH certification.</p>
<span><span>
<p>The anticipated award date is on/about&nbsp;September 1, 2017. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. This solicitation synopsized through the GPE will not be made available through the GPE, and may be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer directly, by email at HainesSG@state.gov, prior to the response date in this notice.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><br />Synopsis:
<p><br />The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) encourages the advanced research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, as well as innovative approaches to meet the threat of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. These efforts are in support of the preparedness mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) articulated in the 2016 PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats. The Implementation Plan is located on the ASPR website: https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/phemce/Documents/2016-phemce-sip.pdf</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act Pub. L. No. 109-417, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 241 et seq. (PAHPA: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ417/pdf/PLAW-109publ417.pdf) and The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Reauthorization Act Pub. L. No. 113-5, (PAHPRA: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ5/pdf/PLAW-113publ5.pdf) authorizes BARDA to (i) conduct ongoing searches for, and support calls for, potential qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products; (ii) direct and coordinate the countermeasure and product advanced research and development activities of the Department of Health and Human Services; (iii) establish strategic initiatives to accelerate countermeasure and product advanced research and development (which may include advanced research and development for purposes of fulfilling requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 351 of this Act) and innovation in such areas as the Secretary may identify as priority unmet need areas; and (iv) award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and enter into other transactions, for countermeasure and product advanced research and development.</p>
<p>Areas of Interest:<br /><br />The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following areas of interest as listed here and further described in Part I.</p>
<p>Research and Development Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1. CBRN Vaccines<br />2. Antitoxins and Therapeutic Proteins<br />3. Antibacterials<br />4. Radiological/Nuclear Threat Medical Countermeasures<br />5. Chemical Threat Medical Countermeasures<br />6. Burn Medical Countermeasures<br />7. CBRN Diagnostics<br />8. Influenza and Emerging Diseases (IED) Therapeutics<br />9. Influenza and Emerging Diseases (IED) Vaccines <br />10. Respiratory Protective Devices<br />11. Ventilators<br />12. Influenza and Emerging Diseases (IED) Diagnostics<br />13. MCM Production Platform Systems<br />14. Modeling and Forecasting<br />15. Visual Analytics</p>
<p>BARDA solicits proposals for the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases that threaten the U.S. civilian population. BARDA anticipates that research and development activities awarded under this BAA will serve to advance candidate medical countermeasures towards licensure or approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This BAA will also serve to advance the knowledge and scientific understanding of candidates' platform technologies, modeling and forecasting, and visual analytics.<br />The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this requirement in the form of a BAA. This synopsis is not a BAA; a BAA itself is anticipated to be posted on or about November 3, 2017. The Government expects to make one or more awards, subject to the availability of funds. The open period of the BAA will be specified in the BAA itself.</p>
<p>Pre-proposal Conference:</p>
<p>A BAA Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled during the BARDA Industry Day from November 7-8, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Advance registration is required. For additional information, and to register, please visit:<br />https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/federal-initiatives/public-meetings-and-conferences/barda-industry-day-2017.aspx</p>

<CONTACT>Elizabeth K. Glasgow, Contract Specialist, Phone 9783188671, Email elizabeth.k.glasgow@usace.army.mil
<DESC><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Improvement Dredging of the Broad Sound North Entrance Channel, portions of the Main Ship Channel, President Roads Anchorage and Portions of the Reserve Channel of Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts Federal Navigation Project. This will be an unrestricted competitive solicitation requiring mechanical dredges to perform the work. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $100,000,000 to $250,000,000. Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.
<p>This project consists of dredging approximately 11,700,000 cubic yards (cy) of silt, blue clay, till and weathered rock to improve the following components of the Federal Navigation Project for Boston Harbor: deepening and widening the Broad Sound North Channel to -51 feet Mean Lower, Low Water (MLLW), deepening and widening the Main Ship Channel (MSC) to the Conley Terminal including the turning basin or "MSC Notch" to -47 feet MLLW, deepening the President Roads Anchorage and deepening the lower Reserved Channel to -47 feet MLLW. The improvement depths noted above are required to be an additional two feet deep in areas of hard material like till and weathered rock. The material dredged to create the federal navigation project improvements will be placed at the Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site (MBDS) approximately 20 miles offshore of Boston Harbor with the exception of a small fraction of the material being placed as a cap to the Main Ship Channel Confined Aquatic Disposal cell that will be completed in December 2017, just downstream of the inner confluence of the Chelsea and Mystic Rivers.</p>
<p>Fast rock is defined as rock having a compressional wave velocity greater than 2,700m/s and will not be removed as part of this contract as no blasting will be permitted. The contractor will be required to bring equipment to accomplish all dredging by mechanical means for the material types previously noted with strength characteristics less than fast rock. Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and are expected to take up to 3&frac12; years to complete. There are no "no dredge" windows during this project.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates including definitive responsibility criteria in the solicitation. After bid opening, but prior to award, the apparent low bidder will be required to furnish documentation that the prime contractor or subcontractor responsible for dredging has:<br />&bull; within the last 10 years, dredged by mechanical means a minimum of 350,000 cubic yards in a consecutive 30-day period and <br />&bull; within the last 10 years, dredged hard material to depths of 35' or more using mechanical equipment and<br />&bull; equipment to be used on this project is capable of dredging material- up to but not including the strength of fast rock, noted above- to a depth of 50' or greater.</p>
<p>This is not an invitation for bids at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about November 16, 2017 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Please note this solicitation will be UNRESTRICTED. In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self-register their firm with federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/www.fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.</p>

Project: Replacement of Structural Floor Slab for Building 43 Dining Room Mental Health
Project Number: 695-17-120
Location:   Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, WI


The Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center has a requirement to Replace the Structural Floor Slab for Building 43 Dining Room Mental Health.  The northern section of Building 43 s dining room (B105) sits above a portion of the Bldg 43 steam tunnel.  The floor slab in this approximate 20 x30  area is severely compromised because of significant concrete and steel slab deterioration.

<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested equipment to the primary point of contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates; and the number of employees is not to exceed the NAICS limitation. NAICS Codes to be used for this acquisition is 336411(1,500 employees) and 336413 (1,250 employees). The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to identify any interested sources before soliciting non-competitive acquisition per FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source" for a modification to the IBCS Development Contract for continued Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) efforts leading up to a Milestone C Decision. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement.
<p>The requirement of this acquisition is to add additional period of performance to the current IBCS Development contract, W31P4Q-08-C-0418, for IBCS EMD development efforts through 3rd Qtr FY21. This includes the incorporation of additional IAMD weapon/sensor component interface requirements, as well as, EMD/Limited User Test changes into the IBCS Major End Items (MEIs) in support of Pre Milestone C Developmental Test/Operational (DT/OT) Test and the procurement of additional RDT&amp;E IBCS MEIs.</p>
<p>The IBCS major supplies and services to be acquired under the extension of the existing contract are: additional hardware prototypes of the IBCS MEIs; engineering services for IBCS engineering changes addressing fixes and obsolescence, software development/maintenance, Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert updates and System Integration Laboratory updates and support; field service representatives, supply support, IBCS system integration and check out; and, IAMD integration and test support and Government and Contractor Laboratory IBCS hardware. The IBCS MEI prototypes consist of the IBCS S-280 Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs), EOC Trailers, Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) B-Kits and Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) Relays, and Launcher Interface Network Kit (LINK) boxes.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the IAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching System of Systems capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total-operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The Army IAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the Army IAMD architecture and developing the IBCS that provides EOCs implementing common Mission Command capability, an IFCN capability for fire-control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common P&amp;F B-Kits located on the EOCs and the IFCN Relays that network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with the IBCS.</p>
<p>The Government does not currently have a technical data package reflecting updated engineering changes or software build version 4 for this effort.</p>
<p>The responses shall address:<br />&bull; Army Air Defense Expertise - Skills, knowledge and abilities associated development, manufacture, integration, and fielding of Army Air Defense Systems to include but not limited to Patriot, Sentinel, IFPC, C2BMC, THAAD, and ADAM. <br />&bull; IAMD Expertise - Skills, knowledge and abilities associated specifically to the requirements, design, implementation, integration and testing of the IBCS system/hardware/software.<br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, key Government Furnished Property, driving assumptions and risks associated with the successful assumption and control of the IBCS Product Baseline, and initial deliveries of IBCS hardware supporting pre MS C DT/OT testing in 4Q FY18. <br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, and risks associated with how the contractor would assume, change, and deploy IBCS software to be responsive to DT/OT activities conducted in 1st Qtr FY18.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting command, ATTN: CCAM-SM-A/Nicholas B. Kirby, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email nicholas.b.kirby.civ@mail.mil and courtesy copied to Pamela Russell, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email pamela.r.russell.civ@mail.mil. Your written responses are required by 1500 CST 27 April 2017. All questions and comments must be in writing (electronic email responses are acceptable), and no telephone calls will be accepted. The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

<DESC>Attached is the U.S. Army Sources Sought Questionnaire related to potential new procurement of the Enhanced Robotic Payloads (ERP) Precision-Aimed Multi-Shot Disruption (PAMSD) technologies. The paragraphs below contain additional information regarding the questionnaire and its subject. If you need further communications with the Army concerning this questionnaire, you may contact the Contract Specialist, Kyle Papke at kyle.y.papke.civ@mail.mil. We thank you in advance for your time and participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire.<br /><br />Background: In order to inform the refinement of the draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for ERP, and to inform the parallel development of an acquisition strategy, cost estimate, cost benefit analysis, technical risk assessment, and performance specification, Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV) seeks to characterize the state of the market for ERP; a suite of modular capabilities designed with open architecture to provide and increased level of standoff, situational awareness, disruption capability and dexterity to respond to current and emergent Engineer, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) requirements. These multiple, modular robotic mission payloads will use open architecture to integrate with the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II (MTRS Inc II), Common Robotic System - Heavy (CRS(H)) and other future platforms to form the Army's next generation platform adaptable robotics systems.<br /><br />While a full set of requirements is not yet available (as it is partially dependent on the information obtained in this market survey), the ERP will: 1) Enhance an EOD teams ability to detect, identify, locate, evaluate, render safe, exploit, and dispose of all Explosive Ordnance (EO), to include Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) at sufficient standoff to improve Soldier survivability and increase mission success. 2) Provide Soldiers the ability to increase operational range between the Operator and the hazard as well as provide the ability to detect, identify, and locate the hazard and transmit that data for use by follow-on site entry teams. ERP will enable CBRN Soldiers to perform site initial entry via unmanned operation thereby reducing Soldier exposure to unknown hazards, and enhancing the Combatant Commander's decision making process. 3) Consist of five capabilities that will mount on existing and programmed Host Unmanned Ground Vehicles (HUGVs) in EOD units: (a) Increased lift capacity and dexterity (b) Increased ability to detect hidden or camouflaged EO through multi-spectral imaging, (c) A render safe capability through selectable and accurate disruption of surface laid or suspended EO, (d) Limit Soldier cognitive burden through autonomous Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM), and (e) Provides dynamic networking for Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) operation and 360 degree ISR capability.
<p><br />This market survey will focus on the ERP Precision-Aimed Multi-Shot Disruption (PAMSD) technologies ONLY. Separate market surveys will be conducted to assess the other desired ERP capabilities. <br /><br />I. Objectives</p>
<p>a. This Sources Sought Questionnaire supports Market Research that will be conducted by the U.S. Army to better understand the availability and capabilities of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or other qualified equipment sources to provide ERP capabilities. The information gathered by the Army through this questionnaire, along with other market investigation data, is solely intended for use by the U.S. Army and will not be shared amongst competing companies. For instructions and more information regarding proprietary information, please refer to Section IV of this document. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire by the various contractors is considered low risk to the commercial companies, as responses will be treated per Section IV as Proprietary.</p>
<p>b. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire provides an important opportunity to influence the solicitation provision and contract clauses, budget requests, and a full range of other elements that supports the acquisition strategy for the Army procurement programs. The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent answering this QUESTIONNAIRE and participation is at the discretion of the equipment manufacturer respondent(s).</p>
<p>II. Instructions</p>
<p>a. Read the capability summary for this effort in Section III of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Responses to this survey should be provided within 30 calendar days of posting.</p>
<p>b. Answer all of the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE as concisely as possible. Due to the magnitude of questions being answered, it is imperative that only what is asked in the questions is part of you answer, please see letter (d) below for submission of additional information. If certain U.S. Army capabilities shown in this QUESTIONNAIRE are deemed not available, or not achievable according to the respondent's company knowledge, please include a concise alternate proposal(s) which would be intended to provide the intent of the capability described therein. It is the U.S. Army's desire to avoid "not applicable" (N/A) type answers.</p>
<p>c. Please provide the projected development resources such as cost and timing to support the survey's objectives. This information is essential in understanding the scope of the project and it is understood by the U.S. Army that this information is strictly a rough estimate. The respondent's company is not contractually obligated to this information. Please avoid N/A, not applicable or blank information. The U.S. Army recognizes these are rough estimates and will use the information strictly as a means for gaining general knowledge. Please include development resource cost and timing estimates for all alternate proposals as well as the mainstream proposal.</p>
<p>d. You may provide product brochures or other forms of information relevant to this QUESTIONNAIRE as is deemed appropriate within a separate attachment to your response, please entitle it "Additional Information". Additionally, it is encouraged to provide any additional information that enables the U.S. Army to gain insight into the company, product performance, reliability and warranty performance. <br /><br />III. Summary for the ERP Sources Sought Questionnaire</p>
<p>This questionnaire applies to the U.S. Army's emerging requirement for plans to procure a set of capabilities that meets the operational requirements currently being refined by the TRADOC Capability Manager for EOD (TCM-EOD) and CBRNE Capability Developers (MSCOE / Capability Development Integration Directorate (CDID)/ Requirements Determination Division (RDD)). The Army intends to develop a performance specification reflecting TCM-EOD/CBRNE's operational requirements and informed by the performance, cost, availability, and supportability of systems in the commercial market. In order to ensure the best value to the U.S. Army and taxpayers, we are surveying the market place to determine if ERP capabilities could be procured competitively.</p>
<p>IV. Proprietary</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this QUESTIONNAIRE. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. (To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY.") Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e. g. trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the QUESTIONNAIRE and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with an explanatory text so the U.S. Government is clearly notified of the data needing to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or other appropriate means to indicate the portion of a single page to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data which is already in the public domain or in possession of the U.S. Government or 3rd parties, or is afterward placed into public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once it is in the public domain. Data which is already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text on both the cover of the transmittal email and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. "</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses which contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of the data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>
<p>7. The U.S. Government will not publish the results of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this QUESTIONNAIRE. If and when a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor these sites for the releases of any synopsis or solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for market research and acquisition planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. At this time, the OCC is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The OCC will not pay for any administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if one is issued.
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br />The OCC is seeking a Contractor who has subject-matter expertise in the field of litigation-support services (LSS). The Contractor must have deep knowledge of the LSS market, namely the industry-leading commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LSS vendors and the functional and technical capabilities of their solutions. The Contractor should have experience advising customers on both the most appropriate COTS solution to meet a customer's functional and technical requirements, as well as the most appropriate support model for that solution, specifically a managed service vs. an internally supported LSS solution.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION<br />Interested parties are requested to respond to the following questions only. General marketing information is not requested and will not be reviewed. If proprietary information is included in a response, it should be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>1. Briefly describe your experience conducting market research for LSS solutions.<br /><br />2. Please identify the LSS COTS solutions with which you are most familiar. These solutions should be those for which your level of knowledge would constitute subject-matter expertise. Please indicate the number of years of experience that you have with these solutions and confirm that your experience is recent, i.e. within the past two (2) years.</p>
<p>3. Briefly describe your experience eliciting, documenting, and validating functional and technical requirements for LSS COTS solutions.</p>
<p>4. Briefly describe your experience serving as a subject-matter expert for the source-selection phase of a procurement of an LSS solution.</p>
<p>5. Please identify your socio-economic status (e.g., small business, women-owned business, etc.).</p>
<p>6. Please indicate whether your services can be acquired via a General Services Administration (GSA) schedule or a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES<br />Responses shall be limited to three (3) pages and submitted via email to Ms. Karen Green, Contracting Officer, at karen.green@occ.treas.gov. Submissions are due by 12 Noon ET on Monday, October 23, 2017, and will be acknowledged via return email. All submissions will become Government property and will not be returned. The file format for responses shall be either MS Word 2013 (or compatible version) or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).</p>
<p>Responses should include the following contact information for the respondent: Name, Business Postal Address, Business Email Address, Telephone Number, and Fax Number.</p>

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The National Institutes of Health is doing a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of ALL small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and/or women owned small business to provide services to the NIH Branch of the Office of General Counsel ("NIH-OGC") in its role as the Department's lead provider of intellectual property legal counseling. NIH-OGC provides trademark searching and counseling; filing and prosecution of trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; international trademark procurement and prosecution; brand management and counseling; domestic and international trademark licensing; and pre-litigation counseling and dispute resolution.  Some of this work will be assigned to the Contractor.  After considering the individual requirements, the work will be assigned through the issuance of a Task Order by NIH-OGC.  Trademark search services, including domestic and international trademark searching and clearance and trademark infringement and validity searches, will be required.
<p>The contractor will be required to maintain a current case docket to ensure that actions are taken and fees paid on a timely basis.  Generally, NIH-OGC will be responsible for the payment of all maintenance fees on U.S. and foreign trademarks and applications.  The work will often require very quick turn-around times, sometimes as short as one or two days, and coverage every business day to make sure that Trademark Office deadlines can always be complied with.</p>
<p>A strong and deeply staffed corporate infrastructure will be necessary to make sure that there are sufficient personnel to satisfy the expected episodic need for filing labor intensive oppositions and other administrative dispute remedies.  It is possible that we could have two or three oppositions on-going simultaneously, and we would expect the contractor to be able to handle that volume of work.</p>
<p>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK<br />The following trademark-related services shall be required:<br />1.	Search Services<br />a.	Domestic and international trademark searching and clearance.<br />b.	Trademark infringement and validity searches.</p>
<p>2.	Trademark Prosecution Services<br />The contractor shall perform all necessary and appropriate services in connection with the filing of trademark registration applications.  All foreign trademark matters shall be handled by the contractor, or foreign associates under the direction of the contractor, in accordance with the applicable statues, regulations, and case law of the particular foreign jurisdiction.  The trademark prosecution services to be provided to NIH-OGC are generally to be considered equivalent to those of "In-House Counsel" and are not to be considered merely equivalent to "Overflow Work."<br />All trademark prosecution services will be conducted on a task order basis. The NIH-OGC Task Ordering Official will originate a Task Order Request for Quote that will describe the specific task and scope of work to be performed.  See the "Task Orders" section, below, for additional details relating to the task ordering procedures.  Some specific examples of requirements related to trademark prosecution services or for particular tasks that will not be enumerated on a task order are:<br />a.	Maintain a current case docket to ensure that actions are taken and fees paid on a timely basis.<br />b.	Generally, NIH-OGC will be responsible for the payment of all maintenance fees on U.S. and foreign trademarks and applications.<br />c.	Mailing copies of all papers filed in the U.S. or foreign trademark office (deliverables) to NIH-OGC and other recipients that are identified in the Task Order, or have been otherwise identified in writing by the NIH-OGC Task Ordering Official, within five (5) business days of the filing.<br />d.	When documents are filed with the USPTO or a foreign trademark office, a copy of the document will be forwarded to NIH-OGC.<br />e.	Mailing copies of official papers and attachments from the USPTO, other authorities, and foreign associate counsel (deliverables) within five (5) business days of their receipt to the NIH-OGC and other parties as identified in the "DELIVERY OF MATERIAL" section.  An analysis of such official correspondence is not required.  <br />f.	Preparing drafts of documents for submission to the USPTO and counterpart foreign authorities sufficiently prior to relevant response time for review and to provide substantive comments in advance of such deadlines and before extension fees might need to be paid; a reasonable time is dependent upon the facts of the circumstances of particular cases, however, the Government believes a minimum of ten (10) working days will be required for review and preparation of comments.  <br /> <br />3.	Oppositions and Cancellations<br />The contractor shall, at the direction of NIH-OGC, file oppositions and cancellations with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), and take necessary actions to represent NIH-OGC.  The contractor shall work closely with the attorneys and staff at NIH-OGC throughout opposition and cancellation proceedings.</p>
<p>4.	Domain Name Dispute Resolution Actions<br />The contractor shall, at the direction of NIH-OGC, file UDRP, URS, or other domain name dispute resolution actions with entities offering domain name dispute resolution outside of the federal or state court systems, and take necessary actions to represent NIH-OGC. The contractor shall work closely with the attorneys and staff at NIH-OGC throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p>5.	Licensing<br />The contractor shall, upon request, provide counseling services to NIH-OGC about select licensing domestic and international licensing matters.  The field of use of the license may vary.</p>
<p>6.	Anti-Counterfeiting<br />The contractor shall, upon request, consult with NIH-OGC on U.S. anti-counterfeiting matters, which includes the development of anti-counterfeiting strategies.  The contractor may be asked to assist NIH-OGC with anti-counterfeiting matters before the U.S. Customs Service.

The potential failure of UPS systems at NMVAHCS exposes mammography systems, MRI scanners, CT scanners, nuclear medicine cameras, the PET/CT system, cardiac catheterization lab systems, interventional angiography systems, and medical servers to damage and failure due to changes in the supplied utility power to the systems. NMVAHCS is requesting a four month, 12/1/2017 to 11/30/2017, maintenance and service contract for UPS systems listed in Section 5, Specific Tasks. Required services include unscheduled onsite repairs, scheduled preventative maintenance (PM) services for UPS systems, associated battery cabinets and/or packs, and replacement of batteries.

This notice does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The Government will be restricted to this information to match information to a possible solicitation.  Public Law 109-461 mandates the VA to consider a total set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set aside. However, if response by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms proves inadequate, an alternate set-aside or full and open competition may be determined.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>FORT RANDALL SPILLWAY EXPANSION JOINT &amp; WATERSTOP REPAIR<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, is seeking business sources, both Large and Small business that can repair the extensive concrete damage to the Ft Randall Dam spillway.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY. NO AWARD WILL BE MADE FROM THIS NOTICE. NO SOLICITATION OR ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THEREFORE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The spillway concrete damage raises the dam safety risk, because the damage is located immediately downstream of the gate structure, along the expansion joint between the gate structure and spillway chute. Spillway chutes are designed to fail first at the downstream end of the spillway. The concrete damage shifts the failure location to the upstream end of the spillway, which increases the dam safety risk. Failure of the spillway slab due to known damage of the expansion joint was carried through as a risk driving potential failure mode during the 2017 Periodic Assessment. There is concern that spillway flows could remove the deteriorated concrete and subject the spillway slab to stagnation pressures that exceed the design strength. This could lead to erosion of the underlying frost blanket and chalk foundation of the spillway piers. Continued erosion of the spillway foundation during high flows could compromise the piers, and potentially the adjacent wall and embankment, leading to an uncontrolled release of the reservoir. Implementation of a properly designed and constructed expansion joint would significantly reduce the risk of spillway failure at this location.</p>
<p>Concrete removal (partial depth removal between 12" and 18" deep and full depth removal at 18" deep) on both sides of the expansion joint between the pier extension slab and the spillway chute slab across the 1000 LF width of the spillway at Fort Randall Dam, South Dakota. Construction of the proposed expansion joint will consist of removal of existing concrete, waterstop, expansion and sealant material; and installation of new stainless steel angles, waterstops, steel reinforcement, concrete, expansion material, joint seal, and a stainless steel cover plate with hardware. Concrete removal methodology will be limited to methods that minimize microfracturing of the substrate concrete in order to maximize the bonding potential of the proposed material.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide the information below in response to this synopsis.<br />CAPABILITY/EXPERIENCE: <br />1. Offeror/Contractor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and email address.</p>
<p>2. Provide your firm's business size: Large Business or Small Business (HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), small disadvantaged, or woman-owned) with regards to the NAICS code 237990.</p>
<p>3. Cage Code and DUNS number.</p>
<p>4. Experience:</p>
<p>a. Completing large civil/site work projects involving concrete repair with contract values in excess of $3 million.</p>
<p>b. Provide information on how your company would perform this concrete repair (Means/Methods).</p>
<p>c. Provide information on your company's experience with hydrodemolition and/or other concrete removal techniques used to minimize microfracturing of substrate materials at depths in excess of 10".</p>
<p>d. Provide 3 examples of projects you completed within the last 10 years that were of similar scope and magnitude.</p>
<p>e. Provide 3 examples of projects within the last 10 years where you were required to set up and operate your own on-site concrete batch plant. Provide volume of material batched for each example.</p>
<p>Submit this information to Kitty Ver Straete, Contract Specialist, via email to Katriena.r.verstraete@usace.army.mil. Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM CST on October 23, 2017.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - 36C10G18Q0056
Ventilators   Medtronic BNOE
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION
1. DESCRIPTION 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires the acquisition of Non-Expendable Equipment in support of the Equipment Life Cycle Management Program (ELCM) National Equipment Catalog (hereafter referred to as the  NE Formulary ).  The ELCM Program and NE Formulary is a partnering effort between the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and VA Office of Acquisition Operations, Strategic Acquisition Center. The VHA ELCM Program has identified Ventilators as a candidate for VA-wide (otherwise referred to as  national ) contract award.  A Ventilator is a machine designed to move breathable air into and out of the lungs, to provide breathing for a patient who is physically unable to breathe or breathing insufficiently.
Historically, each individual medical facility and/or VA Integrated Service Network (VISN) procured these commodities independently through the use of purchase orders or orders against the VA Federal Supply Schedule. This acquisition contemplates a national contract for the purchase of ventilators in support of the ELCM Program in order to build and support the NE Formulary; a cornerstone to the success of the ELCM Program.  The intent of this action is to not only streamline the administrative process, but gain savings associated with leveraged quantity purchases as well.  The alternative to doing a national contract is to continue having the individual medical facility or VISN procure these commodities on their own which could result in increased use of resources.  
The proposed acquisition will consist of a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods from the date of award.  The Government retains the discretion as to whether or not to exercise the option periods, upon annual reviews which will be based upon successful performance during the previous performance periods and the continued need for the product. 
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339112 Surgical and medical instrument manufacturing; product service code (PSC) 6515 Medical and Surgical Instruments, equipment and supplies.
Please refer to the attached Salient Characteristics which describe the requirement.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated in responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will NOT be returned.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive contract nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes.
2. PURPOSE.  VHA is seeking potential vendors who can meet the salient characteristics (see attached) of a Ventilator Medtronic
3. RFI VENDOR SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  
All manufacturers are encouraged to respond, if their product(s) have the capability to meet the Salient Characteristics of the Medtronic Ventilator.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC."

COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for brand name commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number VA119-17-Q-0309 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.
Requirement Description:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press.  

As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:

15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016.
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA.
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014.
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA.
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
Vendors will be required to deliver Video Otoscopes to VA Medical facilities throughout the United States, U. S. Territories, Guam and the Philippines.  The Otometrics/Natus Video Otoscopes   currently accounts for 13% of the total VA Video Otoscopes inventory in medical centers across the country and has been in use throughout VA for over ten years. 
A single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications, and schedule of this solicitation herein.  Quotes shall contain the Offeror s best terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand name equipment.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510 and the associated size standard is 1250 employees.  This procurement action is a set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.  
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Otometrics/Natus brand video otoscopes and related equipment and accessories as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  
The ordering period is three years (36 months).  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors   Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards.

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.</p>

<p>COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.</p>
<p>MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS <br />1. U.S. citizen, obtain/maintain Department of State Secret security, Medical and Ethics clearance.<br />2. Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in one of the following areas: law enforcement, criminal justice, project management, public administration, architecture, construction science, construction management, or engineering (preferably structural or civil engineering) and six (6) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.<br />OR<br />A minimum of ten (10) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.</p>

<p>NOTE: FAC-COR Level II certification is a minimum requirement throughout the life of the contract. The ability to obtain/maintain a Federal Acquisition Certification-Contracting Officer's Representative (FAC-COR) Level III Certification is preferred.</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS IN AFGHANISTAN<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites may be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).

Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>

INL will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, applications (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the applicant's writing, presentation, and communication skills.

<p>COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br /><br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command
Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:

Statement of Need
Smith and Nephew Endoscopic Punches are being requested for surgical shoulder surgeries.  These punches are designed specifically for and to be used with certain procedures for frozen shoulder syndrome.

The Smith & Nephew punches are an industry standard due to surgeons  preference on the tactility, performance and specific angle of these punches. The distinct cupped underbite feature is what sets these punches apart from any other on the market.
This facility scheduled shoulder surgery regularly and these punches are needed to accommodate those procedures.

<CONTACT>Jamie E. MacGillis, Email jamie.e.macgillis.civ@mail.mil - Matthew R. Marx, Contracting Officer, Email matthew.r.marx.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This is a request for information. There is no solicitation available at this time. ACC-APG is seeking to identify potential sources who have the capability and experience to provide the help desk support for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T).
<p><br />SMART-T Overview:</p>
<p>The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T), AN/TSC-154A, is the Army's only anti-jam, low probability of intercept, low probability of detection and nuclear electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) survivable worldwide satellite communication capability. It provides range extension to the Army's current and future tactical communications networks. The SMART-T processes data and voice communications at low, medium, and extended data rates. The AEHF SMART-T operates with MILSTAR/AEHF satellite constellation-compatible communications payloads. The terminal is transportable, palletized, and integrated into a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). 391 SMART-Ts are fielded to the Army, USAF, USMC, Special Users, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><br />Key Help Desk Team Member Skills:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide timely solutions for problems and calls for help from SMART-T users and maintainers<br />&bull; Ability to communicate with SMART-T users and maintainers to capture, document, and convey details of reported problems and needs for help to formulate a solution and in turn guide the user/maintainer through the resolution<br />&bull; Capable of applying troubleshooting techniques to formulate solutions to problems not resolvable by users or maintainers in the field, including the ability to interpret system drawings and interface documents to identify problems not isolated by SMART-T Built In Test (BIT) or system alert messages<br />&bull; Self-motivated to execute tasks in between help desk calls<br />&bull; Experience with operations and maintenance of SMART-T or other SATCOM terminals<br />&bull; Understanding of the physical security and handling of cryptographic and COMSEC material<br />&bull; Understanding of cryptographic key management, COMSEC encryption devices, and router based communications</p>
<p><br />SMART-T Maintenance Strategy:</p>
<p>&bull; The Army maintenance concept is consistent with AR 750-1, Army Materiel Maintenance Policy. A two-level maintenance structure is the framework for AEHF SMART-T hardware maintenance. <br />&bull; Operator maintenance is performed by the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 25Q, "Multichannel Transmission Systems Operator-Maintainer" in accordance with (IAW) TM 11-5895-1881-10 and includes the following tasks: <br />&nbsp; o&nbsp;Scheduled maintenance checks and services.<br />&nbsp; o Fault isolation to defective Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) or Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) through the use of Built-in Test (BIT).<br />&nbsp; o Repair of the system occurs by the replacement of defective CCAs, LRUs, and faulty cables that are easy to remove and replace using common tools.<br />&nbsp; o The SMART-T operator maintains the SMART-T unique generator by performing Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS).<br />&bull; Field maintenance is performed by MOS 25Q IAW TM 11-5895-1881-23 and 23P and includes the following tasks: <br />o Use common Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) with approved Army Technical Manuals (TMs) and troubleshooting procedures, perform isolation of faulty component assemblies, wiring harness, chassis, and subassemblies not readily identified by BIT.<br />&nbsp; o Use BIT to isolate faults and then repair through replacement where replacement tasks exceed the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) constraints at the organizational level.<br />&nbsp; o Repair by replacement of major assemblies and sub-assemblies, including installation and replacement of CCAs and LRUs.<br />&nbsp; o The MOS 52D, "Power Generator Equipment Repairer" will perform field maintenance of the SMART-T unique generator IAW TM 11-6115-747-13 and 23P. <br />&bull; Depot Level Maintenance is being established at the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) for designated LRUs and the Key Load Initialization Facility (KLIF).<br />&bull; The Heavy HMMWV is a standard Army inventory vehicle with an established maintenance concept and structure that is already in place.</p>
<p><br />SMART-T Software Support: Raytheon performs software support to include corrective maintenance (i.e., defect correction) under the terms of the SMART-T system warranty coverage. Raytheon also performs software product improvements and other changes (e.g., requested enhancements and adaptations) through the engineering change process implemented by Product Manager (PdM) SATCOM. Raytheon will continue to provide software Configuration Management (CM) and sustainment. The Communications-Electronics Command's (CECOM's) Software Engineering Center will perform software sustainment management for the system under Post Production Software Support.<br />Hardware Supply Support: The AEHF SMART-T supply support concept for spare and repair parts is as follows:<br />&bull; The CECOM National Inventory Control Point is the Primary Inventory Control Activity and is responsible for all cataloging activity using the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS).<br />&bull; Supply support will occur through military channels IAW the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures system.<br />&bull; The CECOM Integrated Logistics Support Center manages unique SMART-T items, while the Defense Logistics Agency manages common consumables.<br />&bull; The SMART-T Provisioning Bills of Material contain the spares, repair parts, and attaching hardware necessary to accomplish all maintenance as defined in the Maintenance Allocation Chart for the SMART-T system and generator.</p>
<p><br />SMART-T Help Desk Staffing:</p>
<p>&bull; Option #1: A manned help desk is required 7 days a week, 0600 to 2200 (EST) consisting of two shifts with a minimum of 5 personnel per shift along with on-call support outside the manned window. Place of performance is Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. <br />&bull; Option #2: A manned help desk is required 7 days per week, 24 hours per day with a minimum of 5 personnel during the 1st and 2nd shifts and 1 person for the 3rd shift. Place of performance is Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</p>
<p>Position Requirements:<br />&bull; Secret Clearance <br />&bull; Permanent, Full-Time Position<br />&bull; Individuals will remain within their current organization if selected<br />&bull; Work as a member of a 24/7 help desk team<br />&bull; Typical 8 hour work shift; however, irregular work hours, shift work, nights<br />and weekends may be required<br />Response Requirements:</p>

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (GCTT) is contemplating a new acquisition to increase and update the Stryker Maintenance Training System (MTS). Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) has identified the need for additional maintenance trainers to support the Stryker Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) R4 and 91S Skill Based Training courses at the Ordnance Schools located on Fort Lee, VA. Currently, the institutional Stryker 91S schools use fielded Stryker MTS such as Diagnostic and Troubleshooting Trainers (DTT), Part Task Trainers (PTT) and Hands on Trainers (HOT). These institutional trainers provide skill level development for system operation, fault diagnosis, troubleshooting, adjustments, removal and replacement and repair tasks.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:</p>
<p>Hands on Trainers (HOT)<br />The Stryker MTS shall include a training enhancement by supplying additional HOTs for particular training small groups on specific aspects of the Stryker vehicle family. The HOT device or devices will be used to train troubleshooting and basic remove and replace tasks. The HOT device(s) can also be used in the verification of repair. The HOT device(s) will provide all the functionality of the given portion of the Stryker family isolated from the total system and allow instructor induced failure to train specific tasks. These HOT maintenance trainers are required at Fort Lee to support and enhance the current training program. All maintenance training is based on the procedures contained in the Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and the simulation database for all Stryker MTS components must continually be upgraded to the latest IETM version. Changes to the IETM are expected every two or three years and with each new version the simulation database must be updated to match the new troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, and the changes incorporated into each of the DTTs, PTTs, and HOTs along with a hardware technical refresh. Along with the Department of Defense (DoD) mandated upgrade to the latest Windows Operating System (OS) - currently Windows 10.</p>
<p>Currently, the Fort (Ft) Lee school house includes one Hands on Trainer (HOT) for the Stryker Remote Weapon System (RWS) and five Hull HOTs. There are no HOTs for the Anti-Tank Guided Missile variant (ATGM), Mortar Carrier variant (MC) or the Mobile Gun System (MGS). Weapon system training for these variants currently utilizes tactical vehicles. Based on course loads for 91S, this requires 5 HOTs trainers each. Also, a major design change (A1) to the Stryker vehicle require changes to the current Hull HOTs (5) and additional training devices. Two of the five fielded Hull HOTs are to be upgraded to the A1 design training requirements and the other three require a technical refresh as many key components are wearing out and need updating. To support development and production of the HOTs, the Government intends to provide Government Furnished Property (GFP).</p>
<p>Below is a list of the particular HOTs to be delivered in this effort:<br /><br />Mobile Gun System (MGS) 5 systems<br />Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) 5 systems<br />Remote Weapon System (RWS) 5 systems<br />Mortar Carrier (MC) 5 systems<br />Stryker A1 Hull 2 systems (reuse 2 of 5 fielded)<br />Stryker Hull Tech Refresh 3 systems (3 remaining of 5)</p>
<p>With an anticipated delivery will be required for the following:<br />HOT MGS - First Article FY19Q4 Remaining 4: FY21<br />HOT ATGM - First Article FY20Q1 Remaining 4: FY20-FY21<br />HOT RWS - First Article FY20Q2 Remaining 4: FY20-FY21<br />HOT MC - First Article FY19Q4 Remaining 4: FY20<br />HOT A1 Stryker - First Article FY21Q2 Remaining 1: FY21</p>
<p>Part Task Trainers (PTT)<br />The MTS shall include a training enhancement by supplying additional PTTs for particular training small groups on specific aspects of the Stryker vehicle family. The PTT device or devices will be used to train troubleshooting and basic remove and replace tasks. The PTT device(s) can also be used in the verification of repair. The PTT device(s) will provide all the functionality of the given subsystem portion of the Stryker family isolated from the total system and allow instructor induced failure to train specific tasks. These PTT maintenance trainers are required at Fort Lee to support and enhance the current training program. All maintenance training is based on the procedures contained in the Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and the simulation database for all Stryker MTS components must continually be upgraded to the latest IETM version. Changes to the IETM are expected every two or three years and with each new version the simulation database must be updated to match the new troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, and the changes incorporated into each of the DTTs, PTTs, and HOTs along with a hardware technical refresh. Along with the Department of Defense (DoD) mandated upgrade to the latest Windows Operating System (OS) - currently Windows 10.</p>
<p>A major design change to the Stryker vehicle require two additional power pack PTTs variants and a PTT Hull C9 engine Replace and Remove. The Stryker redesign to the double-V hull included a new caterpillar C-7 engine, and a newer caterpillar C-9 engine. New PTTs are required for both the new C-7 engine used in the double-V hull design, new C-9 engine and a Hull Replace and Remove (Hull R&amp;R). To support development and production of the PTTs, the Government intends to provide Government Furnished Property (GFP). Below is a list of the particular PTTSs to be delivered in this effort:</p>
<p>C7 Engine 1 systems<br />C9 Engine 1 systems<br />C9 Engine Hull R&amp;R 1 systems</p>
<p>With an anticipated delivery will be required for the following:<br />C7 Engine - First Article FY20Q2 <br />C9 Engine - First Article FY21Q2 <br />C9 Engine Hull R&amp;R - First Article FY20Q4</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to identify any interested sources before soliciting non-competitive acquisition per FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source" for a modification to the IBCS Development Contract for continued Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) efforts leading up to a Milestone C Decision. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement.
<p>The requirement of this acquisition is to add additional period of performance to the current IBCS Development contract, W31P4Q-08-C-0418, for IBCS EMD development efforts through 3rd Qtr FY21. This includes the incorporation of additional IAMD weapon/sensor component interface requirements, as well as, EMD/Limited User Test changes into the IBCS Major End Items (MEIs) in support of Pre Milestone C Developmental Test/Operational (DT/OT) Test and the procurement of additional RDT&amp;E IBCS MEIs.</p>
<p>The IBCS major supplies and services to be acquired under the extension of the existing contract are: additional hardware prototypes of the IBCS MEIs; engineering services for IBCS engineering changes addressing fixes and obsolescence, software development/maintenance, Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert updates and System Integration Laboratory updates and support; field service representatives, supply support, IBCS system integration and check out; and, IAMD integration and test support and Government and Contractor Laboratory IBCS hardware. The IBCS MEI prototypes consist of the IBCS S-280 Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs), EOC Trailers, Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) B-Kits and Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) Relays, and Launcher Interface Network Kit (LINK) boxes.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the IAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching System of Systems capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total-operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The Army IAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the Army IAMD architecture and developing the IBCS that provides EOCs implementing common Mission Command capability, an IFCN capability for fire-control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common P&amp;F B-Kits located on the EOCs and the IFCN Relays that network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with the IBCS.</p>
<p>The Government does not currently have a technical data package reflecting updated engineering changes or software build version 4 for this effort.</p>
<p>The responses shall address:<br />&bull; Army Air Defense Expertise - Skills, knowledge and abilities associated development, manufacture, integration, and fielding of Army Air Defense Systems to include but not limited to Patriot, Sentinel, IFPC, C2BMC, THAAD, and ADAM. <br />&bull; IAMD Expertise - Skills, knowledge and abilities associated specifically to the requirements, design, implementation, integration and testing of the IBCS system/hardware/software.<br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, key Government Furnished Property, driving assumptions and risks associated with the successful assumption and control of the IBCS Product Baseline, and initial deliveries of IBCS hardware supporting pre MS C DT/OT testing in 4Q FY18. <br />&bull; Conceptual approach, estimated lead times, and risks associated with how the contractor would assume, change, and deploy IBCS software to be responsive to DT/OT activities conducted in 1st Qtr FY18.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting command, ATTN: CCAM-SM-A/Nicholas B. Kirby, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email nicholas.b.kirby.civ@mail.mil and courtesy copied to Pamela Russell, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email pamela.r.russell.civ@mail.mil. Your written responses are required by 1500 CST 21 April 2017. All questions and comments must be in writing (electronic email responses are acceptable), and no telephone calls will be accepted. The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

<DESC>ENHANCED ROBOTIC PAYLOADS (ERP) <br />Obstacle Avoidance &amp; Digital Modeling<br />SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>Attached is the U.S. Army Sources Sought Questionnaire related to potential new procurement of the Enhanced Robotic Payloads (ERP) Obstacle Avoidance &amp; Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM) technologies. The paragraphs below contain additional information regarding the questionnaire and its subject. If you need further communications with the Army concerning this questionnaire, you may contact Delores Trotter, Buyer <a href="mailto:delores.v.trotter.civ@mail.mil">delores.v.trotter.civ@mail.mil</a>. We thank you in advance for your time and participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire. <br /><br />Background: In order to inform the refinement of the draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for ERP, and to inform the parallel development of an acquisition strategy, cost estimate, cost benefit analysis, technical risk assessment, and performance specification, Product Manager Unmanned Ground Vehicles (PdM UGV)&nbsp;seeks to characterize the state of the market for ERP; a suite of modular capabilities designed with open architecture to provide and increased level of standoff, situational awareness, disruption capability and dexterity to respond to current and emergent Engineer, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) requirements. These multiple, modular robotic mission payloads will use open architecture to integrate with the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II (MTRS Inc. II), Common Robotic System-Heavy (CRS(H)) and other future platforms to form the Army's next generation platform adaptable robotics systems. <br /><br />While a full set of requirements is not yet available (as it is partially dependent on the information obtained in this market survey), the ERP will: 1) Enhance an EOD Teams ability to detect, identify, locate, evaluate, render safe, exploit, and dispose of all Explosive Ordnance (EO), to include Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) at sufficient standoff to improve Soldier survivability and increase mission success. 2) Provide Soldiers the ability to increase operational range between the Operator and the hazard as well as provide the ability to detect, identify, and locate the hazard and transmit that data for use by follow-on site entry teams. ERP will enable CBRN Soldiers to perform site initial entry via unmanned operation thereby reducing Soldier exposure to unknown hazards, and enhancing the Combatant Commander's decision making process. 3) Consist of five capabilities that will mount on existing and programmed Host Unmanned Ground Vehicles (HUGVs) in EOD units: (a) Increased lift capacity and dexterity (b) Increased ability to detect hidden or camouflaged EO through multi-spectral imaging, (c) A render safe capability through selectable and accurate disruption of surface laid or suspended EO, (d) Limit Soldier cognitive burden through autonomous Obstacle Avoidance and Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM), and (e) Provides dynamic networking for Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) operation and 360 degree ISR capability.<br /><br />This market survey will focus on the ERP Obstacle Avoidance &amp; Digital Modeling (OA&amp;DM) technologies ONLY. Separate market surveys will be conducted to assess the other desired ERP capabilities. <br /><br />I. Objectives<br />a. This Sources Sought Questionnaire supports Market Research that will be conducted by the U.S. Army to better understand the availability and capabilities of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or other qualified equipment sources to provide ERP capabilities. The information gathered by the Army through this questionnaire, along with other market investigation data, is solely intended for use by the U.S. Army and will not be shared amongst competing companies. For instructions and more information regarding proprietary information, please refer to Section IV of this document. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire by the various contractors is considered low risk to the commercial companies, as responses will be treated per Section IV as Proprietary. <br />b. Participation in this Sources Sought Questionnaire provides an important opportunity to influence the solicitation provision and contract clauses, budget requests, and a full range of other elements that supports the acquisition strategy for the Army procurement programs. The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent answering this QUESTIONNAIRE and participation is at the discretion of the equipment manufacturer respondent(s).</p>
<p>II. Instructions<br />a. Read the capability summary for this effort in Section III of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Responses to this survey should be provided within 30 calendar days of posting. <br />b. Answer all of the questions in the QUESTIONNAIRE as concisely as possible. Due to the magnitude of questions being answered, it is imperative that only what is asked in the questions is part of you answer, please see letter (d) below for submission of additional information. If certain U.S. Army capabilities shown in this QUESTIONNAIRE are deemed not available, or not achievable according to the respondent's company knowledge, please include a concise alternate proposal(s) which would be intended to provide the intent of the capability described therein. It is the U.S. Army's desire to avoid "not applicable" (N/A) type answers. <br />c. Please provide the projected development resources such as cost and timing to support the survey's objectives. This information is essential in understanding the scope of the project and it is understood by the U.S. Army that this information is strictly a rough estimate. The respondent's company is not contractually obligated to this information. Please avoid N/A, not applicable or blank information. The U.S. Army recognizes these are rough estimates and will use the information strictly as a means for gaining general knowledge. Please include development resource cost and timing estimates for all alternate proposals as well as the mainstream proposal. <br />d. You may provide product brochures or other forms of information relevant to this QUESTIONNAIRE as is deemed appropriate within a separate attachment to your response, please entitle it "Additional Information". Additionally, it is encouraged to provide any additional information that enables the U.S. Army to gain insight into the company, product performance, reliability and warranty performance. <br /><br />III. Summary for the ERP Sources Sought Questionnaire<br />This questionnaire applies to the U.S. Army's emerging requirement for plans to procure a set of capabilities that meets the operational requirements currently being refined by the TRADOC Capability Manager for EOD (TCM-EOD) and CBRNE Capability Developers (MSCOE / Capability Development Integration Directorate (CDID)/ Requirements Determination Division (RDD)). The Army intends to develop a performance specification reflecting TCM-EOD/CBRNE's operational requirements and informed by the performance, cost, availability, and supportability of systems in the commercial market. In order to ensure the best value to the U.S. Army and taxpayers, we are surveying the market place to determine if ERP capabilities could be procured competitively.<br /><br />IV. Proprietary<br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this QUESTIONNAIRE. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. (To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY.") Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e. g. trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the QUESTIONNAIRE and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with an explanatory text so the U.S. Government is clearly notified of the data needing to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or other appropriate means to indicate the portion of a single page to be protected. <br /><br />3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data which is already in the public domain or in possession of the U.S. Government or 3rd parties, or is afterward placed into public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once it is in the public domain. Data which is already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the government's rights in the data. <br /><br />4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text on both the cover of the transmittal email and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. "<br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br /><br />6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses which contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of the data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br /><br />7. The U.S. Government will not publish the results of this QUESTIONNAIRE. Respondents WILL NOT be notified regarding information obtained related to this QUESTIONNAIRE. If and when a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the respondent's responsibility to monitor these sites for the releases of any synopsis or solicitation.</p>

<p><strong>AF/A2 INDUSTRY SYMPOSIUM: NEXT GENERATION OF ISR DOMINANCE </strong>
<p>(U) ISR is the foundation upon which every joint, interagency and coalition operation achieves success-a core mission since 1947. In the future, ISR will continue to be conducted in, from and through all domains, in all phases of operations and in increasingly complex operating environments ranging from permissive to highly-contested.</p>
<p>(U) ISR focuses on operational outcomes and closing intelligence gaps. To build a comprehensive plan for the Air Force, AF Strategic Planners have identified and prioritized capability and capacity gaps. These gaps characterize risk across the ISR enterprise and inform mitigating proposals from ISR planners and industry partners. The AF/A2 ISR Industry Symposium will present an opportunity to discuss future capability gaps, near-peer adversary threats to ISR and current Air Force and private sector efforts to bridge anticipated gaps. Department of Defense leadership continues to encourage more effective communication between warfighters and industry and our ISR Industry Symposium will offer unique opportunities for classified presentations and discussions.</p>

<p><strong>MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By and Between</p>
<p>USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AF/A2)</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>(Non-Government Co-Sponsor - TBD)<em>For the AF/A2 Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Industry Symposium 2018</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>1. <strong>Nature and Purpose</strong>.&nbsp;The purpose of this Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is to establish a formal agreement between the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AF/A2) and the ___[Non-Federal Entity (NFE)]___ which sets forth the guidelines and responsibilities for the coordination and accomplishment of actions directed towards conducting the AF/A2 ISR Industry Symposium (hereafter referred to as "symposium") scheduled for 2 February 2018 at the J.D. Hill Conference Center. The subject matter of the symposium will consist of speakers, discussion and other interaction, which relate to the Air Force ISR mission. Specifically, the symposium will focus on a theme of The Next Generation of ISR Dominance. This co-sponsorship arrangement provides the best avenue to facilitate the effective discussion of and/or stimulate wider interest in the issues relevant to both parties to this agreement.<br /><br />This MOA is entered into pursuant to the Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), DoD 5500.7-R, Section 3-206b. This MOA addresses functions and responsibilities that are necessary for the AF/A2 and ___[NFE]__ to organize and execute the symposium.</em></p>
<p><em>2. <strong>Objectives and Considerations</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>2018 A2 ISR Industry Symposium theme: The Next Generation of ISR Dominance</em></p>
<p><em>"Data is a weapon and the electromagnetic spectrum is its domain." -Lt Gen Dash Jamieson</em></p>
<p><em>The symposium this year will begin with a section on threats to ISR capabilities of the future. We will then have a series of briefings sharing the current AF/A2 strategic vision, and tools for achieving fusion warfare. Achieving fusion warfare means having control of the EM spectrum to ensure data can be transported from the ISR sensing grid to decision-makers at the operational and tactical edge without interference from our adversaries. Algorithmic warfare, artificial intelligence, and machine learning will be our tools of the future in that effort.</em></p>
<p><em>The afternoon will focus on capabilities development in the open architecture. Open architecture systems will allow us to 'upgrade' faster to ensure new data sources are also 2 ingested for further analysis. It is critical we apply open architecture systems to our ISR collection and ISR Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED) efforts moving forward.</em></p>
<p><em>Presentations will be up to the TS/SCI level of classification. The symposium will provide an environment for participating attendees from the Air Force and commercial sectors to interact on the themed issues and the feedback generated from this symposium will be used by both the Air Force and Air Force contractors to plan for future requirements.</em></p>
<p><em>3. <strong>Primary Roles and Responsibilities</strong>: To foster the purposes of this MOA, the following delineates the responsibilities of the respective parties:</em><em><strong>The Air Force will:</strong></em></p>
<p>(1) Set the theme for the symposium.</p>
<p>(2) Provide the Sensitive Compartmented Information threat briefing.</p>
<p>(3) Appoint personnel to act as liaisons to support ___[NFE]___ in developing the symposium's technical program. Such support may include proposing topics, speakers, and presentation formats, as well as developing a schedule for symposium planning tasks/milestones.</p>
<p>(4) Arrange for government speakers/presenters and coordinate their participation and support.</p>
<p>(5) In conjunction with the National Reconnaissance Office, J.D. Hill Conference Center security personnel, be the on-site security manager. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, access control and verification of registrants.</p>
<p>(6) Establish an initial schedule for the symposium and coordinate with the NFE on the final schedule for the symposium.<br /><br /><strong><em>The NFE will:<br /></em><br /></strong>(1) Help to develop the symposium's technical program, which will include proposed topics, speakers, and presentation forms.</p>
<p>(2) Will obtain and coordinate participation of industry speakers.</p>
<p>(3) With the Air Force liaison develop a schedule for symposium planning tasks/milestones.</p>
<p>(4) Develop a master mailing list for the symposium invitees and attendees.<br /><br />(5) Manage registration for the symposium. Establish, maintain and protect a list of symposium attendees that includes names, addresses (United States Postal Service and e-mail), phone numbers, and registration information.</p>
<p>(6) Contract with vendors and entities for symposium meeting space and services as required (e.g., food, printing, graphics, and audio/visual support, technological infrastructure, etc.) and ensuring no prohibited expenses are incurred (e.g. musicians, entertainers, extraneous promotional items, decorations, or other goods and services unrelated to the purpose of the symposium).</p>
<p>(7) Function as the on-site point of contact to handle all coordination activities and ensure that supporting personnel are available.</p>
<p>(8) Establish and administer a registration fee structure (government, NFEs) to help offset anticipated expenses in coordination with the Air Force.

<p>The contract ordering period is estimated to be five years. The place of performance is the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has been tasked by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to convert 14 C-27J Cargo Aircraft (currently configured for cargo, transports, and airdrops) into HC-27J Maritime Patrol Aircraft. This will be accomplished by installing the aircraft with approximately 19 separate systems/subsystems, thereby providing the vehicle with missionization capabilities to perform enhanced medium range maritime surveillance and logistical missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This procurement requirement is to order up to nineteen (19) Multi-Mode RADAR (MMR) Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, engineering technical services (i.e. integration, installation &amp; fielding), and logistics support (i.e. reliability &amp; maintainability data, user &amp; maintenance manuals, publication source data) for use within the USCG HC-27J fleet will be included. Two of the primary requirements for this procurement require that the radar system must be such that it is currently in the USCG inventory and that the radar system is currently integrated with the US Coast Guard Minotaur Mission System Software. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally the USCG requires that all items be state of the market non-developmental items (NDI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Government Furnished Property will NOT be provided and the USCG requires new procurement equipment only. Responses to RFI- N68335-15-R-0163 verified that there were only two vendors who manufacture the MMR System that meet these requirements.</p>
<p>A limited sources acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>The HF antennas are an integral part of the man portable radio communications package.&nbsp; Due to the physical configuration of the RIS 3.0 systems, the antennas, masts, and T-bar adapters are required to have a small form factor while meeting or exceeding the required functionality.&nbsp; The requested C&amp;S Antennas, Inc. equipment has been previously procured and integrated into the 3.0 system and meets all the required functionality.&nbsp; The small size and weight of the antenna allows for simplified storage for transport in ancillary transit cases, as well as simplified operation when utilized with the system.</p>
<p>The C&amp;S Antennas, Inc. brand HF Antennas, 10M Masts, and T-Bar Adapters are the only devices found to meet the RIS 3.0 Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, these devices allow for communication through Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS), Omnidirectional, and Directional that cover short (0-150 km), medium (150-800 km), and long range (800+ km) anywhere in the world, meeting MIL-STD 810G.&nbsp; The HF Antenna is also required to have the ability to be erected by two (2) people within thirty (30) minutes.&nbsp; The 10M Mast is required to withstand hurricane force winds, extreme cold or heat, and dry or tropical conditions.&nbsp; The T-Bar Adapter is required to mount to the requested HF antenna.</p>
<p>Delivery is required within thirty (30) days of contract award<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to issue a sole source contract to C&amp;S Antennas Inc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.&nbsp; All inquiries and concerns must be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Jason Ucci at jason.ucci@navy.mil. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 7 September 2017 10 AM EST.&nbsp; A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future competition.</p>

Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 05   Page 1 of 1
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA261-17-AP-15412
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 

XXXXXXXXX
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Emergency requirement for the drug Vistogard to rapidly treat chemotherapy overdose.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  
Only the drug Vistogard would meet the patient s needs. While there are multiple distributors, Vistogard was sought directly from Cardinal Health in an urgent effort to save the patient s life. The drug has been ordered, delivered, and administered to the patient.



4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 
Market research consisted of searches of Google, VA NAC catalog search tool, and FPDS. Vistogard was approved by the FDA in 2015 to treat emergency acute chemotherapy overdose. Nationwide, VA has purchased the drug from Cardinal Health 3 times since.
