WSPA has the needed expertise to conduct the work and has also first hand knowledge of the work that the USGS Information Technology Security Management Unit is conducting.  WSPA is the only known source capable of performing the required work.  WSPA has been spearheading an effort to improve USGS IT security program activities under an existing contract 06ERCN0011.  Prior to that Mr. Pfancuff worked with DOI's IT Security Office.  The period of performance began in December 2003 and is ongoing.  His background includes previous experience as the former Deputy Chief Information Officer for DOI.  He is thoroughly familiar with USGS systems and policies, both through his current duties as a contractor for the GIO as well as his previous federal and ongoing contract work in the DOI OCIO office and with USGS.   Working with DOI, Mr. Pfancuff gained a unique understanding the USGS organizational structure, mission, culture, and IT security environment which cannot be duplicated.  He has played an integral role in the IT Security Steering Committee, contributing to the initial charter and leading efforts to ensure that the committee functions effectively. Due to his expertise on both the Departmental as well as the Bureau level, Mr. Pfancuff's services are uniquely suited to best fulfill the requirements of the contract.  There is no written solicitiation for this requirement. This award will be made on or about February 9, 2007. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING SPECIALIST 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Oregon Water Science Center is currently negotiating a long-term cooperative agreement with Portland State University for collaborative research and physical collocation.  It is anticipated that the USGS will begin occupying space at PSU's 5th Avenue Business Center in July 2007; minor renovation is required prior to USGS occupancy. As a condition of occupancy, the USGS must seek approval from PSU before contracting for any non-emergency building maintenance or repair.  PSU has required that these immediate renovations be completed by PSU work crews.  Thus, in order to obtain the necessary renovations, the USGS must contract directly with PSU.   Based on the above, the USGS intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with PSU of Portland, Oregon IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Other interested concerns having the ability to complete this construction shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer not later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  As required by FAR 5.102(a)(1), the forthcoming solicitation (07WRSS0010) will also be made available through the GPE, whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified. As required by FAR 36.204, "Disclosure of the Magnitude of Construction Projects," please note that the estimated price of this project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>USAID announces its intention to solicit for a four year activity named Tijara - Provincial Economic Growth (PEG). (In the Arabic language, Tijara means Trade.)  The purpose of this activity is to provide business development and financial services to Iraqi beneficiaries in strategic locations across the country to promote economic diversification and employment, with an emphasis on the growth of the manufacturing and service sectors in provinces throughout Iraq.  There will be two components in the resultant contract.  In Component One, the contractor shall provide business development services with a focus on sector competitiveness by training businesses in selected industries, supporting effective business associations, promoting association advocacy, creating an enabling environment which reduces current constraints to business operations, developing market information systems, and establishing public-private partnerships.  In Component Two, the Contractor shall focus on expansion of commercial lending through microfinance institutions and banks by providing training and technical assistance; disseminating information, education, knowledge management and research; and operating a grant facility.  This program will also support the International Compact with Iraq in areas related to Private Sector Development and Investment Promotion as well as Financial Sector Restructuring.  The Contractor shall work in coordination with the Government of Iraq, the US Government-managed Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) as well as appropriate US Government agencies and offices in Washington and Baghdad.  Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are joint civil-military initiatives that assist provincial governments to develop a transparent and sustained capability to govern, promote security and the rule of law, promote political and economic development, and provide the requisite provincial administration to meet the basic needs of the population.  It is USG policy to utilize the PRT mechanism in provincial and local government support programs to coordinate assistance at the provincial level.  In addition to the PRTs, the Contractor must recognize that the US Government is concentrating reconstruction efforts on strategic cities in Iraq.  These cities are currently Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Baquba, North Babil, Fallujah, Kirkuk, Ramadi, and Samarra.  The focus under Tijara - PEG will be on the non-agricultural sectors since another USAID-funded activity, the Inma Agribusiness Program, will focus on agriculture issues.  Posting of the solicitation is expected before the end of February 2007.     Please do not contact the Mission with queries before this time.

<DESC>This is a Synopsis in support of market research being conducted by the US Air Force to determine interest and capabilities of industry.  50th Contracting Sq, Schriever AFB, Colorado is contemplating a sole source award of a contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements for follow-on sustainment and enhancement of TALON NAMATH.  The initial TALON NAMATH project was awarded to NAVSYS Corp under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982.  TALON NAMATH developed data products for Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy enhancement and a distribution system for these products.  NAMATH provides timely navigation data to the warfighter to satisfy weapon accuracy requirements.  The project utilizes the GPS Master Control Station, the GPS Operations Center (GPSOC) and its GPS Information System (GPSIS), the DoD IT infrastructure, existing tactical data links, Combined Air Operations Centers (CAOC,) weapon platforms, and weapons.  Currently, the Government requires an initial sustainment package to provide maintenance and help line support of the NAMATH Tactical Control Station (TCS) software and systems located at Vandenberg AFB and Schriever AFB.  The basic contract period of performance is one year from contract award and is expected to commence 1 March 2007.  The Government shall have the option of extending this contract for up to two additional six-month periods. Additionally, it provides for a technical services option to be used primarily for software enhancements should that become necessary.  Several critical aspects of the TALON NAMATH architecture, software, and interfaces are provided to the Government with Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Data Rights and/or Restricted Data Rights.  This is a primary reason for contemplating the award of a sole source contract to NAVSYS Corp for the follow-on sustainment effort.  Interested parties should be prepared to discuss, in detail, a plan to sustain and enhance the Talon Namath system that is provided to the Government with SBIR and Restricted Data Rights.  The government will not reimburse the costs of preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary. Any questions should be submitted to Capt Jens Norgaard via e-mail.  Interested parties should submit a Statement of Capability via e-mail NLT COB 15 February 2007.  The Statement of Capability should be a maximum of 10 pages, single sided, and use a typeface no smaller than 10 points. The Statement of Capability should outline the following: Technical approach and capability, Plan to successfully sustain and enhance a system provided to the Government with SBIR and Restricted Data Rights, Schedule, Estimated costs, Experience with GPS accuracy enhancement and distribution systems, and Proven capabilities in development, test and sustainment.  All respondents must supply the following: Company name, address, CAGE code, point of contact (POC) for information, size of business, US or foreign owned.  Small Business companies are encouraged to respond.  The NAICS code is 541511 and the size standard is $23M. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, HQ AFSPC/A7K, (719) 692-5250 phone, (719) 692-5299 fax. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

These items are used on the F/A-18A/B/C/D, P-3 and E2C aircraft in operation by the Navy and Marine Corps. TLS is a process whereby the awardee provisions, stocks, repairs, and/or replaces, stores, and ships serviceable ready-for-issue equipment directly to the end user within guaranteed delivery timeframes. TLS also requires the awardee to provide an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the awardee assumes responsibility for many management and support functions previously performed by the Government, including 1) modification and upgrade, 2)engineering and logistics support, 3)configuration management, 4)material management, including furnishing consumable piece parts, 5)maintenance of source data packages to acc!  ount for technical changes. The contract will incentivize the awardee to provide commercial technology insertion through a requirement to improve reliability of these components. TLS of said components is premised on a teaming relationship between the awardee, Caterpillar Logistics Services, and Naval Avaition Depots Cherry Point, NC and Jacksonville, FL. The resultant Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract will be a Requirements contract consisting of one 5 year base, with one 5 year option. Due to the unique nature of the TLS process for above mentioned items, only Honeywell International, Inc. which is providing TLS of APU systems on P-3, S-3, C-2, F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F and Navy C-130 aircraft under an existing PBL contract with the Navy, (N00383-00-D-007J) will be solicited., See Note 22, See Note 22*****

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The laboratory of the Director of the National Cancer Institute was founded in spring 2006. The major focus of the Laboratory is to identify, characterize, grow, and dissect the mechanisms of tissue and tumor stem cell maintenance and propagation. When putative stem cells are isolated from fresh tissue they should be evaluated for the presence of multiple stem cell markers by using fluorescent microscope capable of simultaneous analysis of at least three different fluorochromes. To conduct this type of research the laboratory is critically dependent on a good quality fluorescent microscope. The total amount of hours the laboratory is spending with the microscope is between five (5) to six (6) hours a day.  An alternative source for a microscope for this extensive period of time, has not been identified. 

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b) and 13.501-(a)(1)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:  
NCI requires an Olympus microscope (BX61) with a motorized fluorescence system and a Photometrics camera (Cool Snap cf). The microscope needs to be equipped with 5 objectives (ULSAPO 10x, 20x, 40x, 60x, 100x) and 4 filter sets (DAPI, FITC, Texas Red, Bright field/phase contrast/DIC).  The laboratory has utilized and collected data from this imaging workstation which is located in a separate building.  Researchers would like to continue to maintain consistency in data collection and user familiarity, in the building the laboratory is currently utilizing.  Two collaborating laboratories in the area also use instruments that are compatible with this instrument resulting in greater flexibility in research needs.

The BX61 imaging workstation is designed for the acquisition and overlay of multiple wavelength fluorochromes in an automated mode. The need for the increased sensitivity for fluorescence in addition to standard H&E (hematoxylin and eosion) imaging requires the use of the included fast firewire 1394 digital camera with cooling down to minus 30 degrees C and a liquid crystal color filter for H&E imaging. All components of the workstation will be automatically controlled through the included software.

This procurement will also include no neighbor 2D deconvolution for increased signal to noise fluorescence with the ability to upgrade to high-speed constrained iterative 3-D deconvolution.                                                       

The following salient characteristics apply:

Microscope:
	Motorized focus drive of 0.01 micron step size
	6-position filter turret with 0.1 sec shutter speed
	Planfluorite 60x/1.25-0.60 NA with built in iris
	Planfluorite 100x/1.3-0.55 NA with built in iris
	All lenses Planfluorite versions with Phase Contrast
	100Wat mercury source with Apochromatically corrected collector lens for multi-wavelength imaging

Imaging workstation
	Retiga Monochrome FireWire 1394 digital camera
	12 Bit, 4096 gray level discrimination
	Peltier cooling to minus 30 degrees Celsius
	RGB Liquid Crystal filter (Maximum optical input 500mW/cm2
	Upgrade hardware drivers included
	2D deconvolution with upgradability to high-speed constrained iterative 3D deconvolution.
	Time lapse   

Olympus America is the only known source to the NCI that manufacturers this instrument and that provides the salient characteristics required by the NCI research community.

The required capacity for two-way secure LOS data communications is 25 IPs, with storage for up to 25 pre-formatted interrogation statements, and up to 200 received or transmitted messages. 	The interrogator shall be highly reliable and include a Built-in-Test (BIT) capability to quickly ascertain proper operation.   	The interrogator will incorporate the appropriate security schema applicable to the  PRC-112G (Commercial Encryption) and to the CSEL System (NSA approved encryption). 	For airborne operations, the contractor shall propose a means to secure the interrogator to the pilot's leg for both in-flight use and during ejection.  The interrogator design will allow for operations with the various UHF/Inter-communication systems (ICS) that exist on Service aircraft that support the Personnel Recovery On-Scene Commander (PR OSC) and rescue vehicle function.  The interrogator must allow the normally used headset to simultaneously connect to the same communications port (connector) and share the selected radio for LOS audio voice or interrogator LOS data communications.  The interrogator must be capable of being connected quickly to the aircrew ICS communication cords and must not injure or hinder the aircrew, or hinder the operation of the ejection seat during normal or emergency operation; the design needs to meet current standards for certification as safe to fly.   	The interrogator size and volume should not exceed 32 oz and 38 cubic inches with its self-contained power source, not including its cable assembly.  The objective length is under 7.5in, max width of 3.6in at the display, and max thickness of 2.5in at the display.  	For daylight operation, the interrogator shall be viewable in sunlight.   	For night operations the interrogator shall be viewable with and without Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  	The interrogator will not draw power from the aircraft electrical system, and as such, a battery life of 8 hours is needed. 	The environmental requirements include interior cockpit operations, and exterior blowing rain, salt water immersion, snow, ice, dust and mud.   	The interrogator must incorporate a serial interface for upload and download of mission data, cryptographic key material and be capable of upgrading software. 	The interrogator must have a two action zeroize capability that clears all mission data and cryptographic material stored in the interrogator.  The interrogator will notify the user of zeroization at first action and upon confirmation (second action), display 'zeroized' after all data and keys are purged. 	The interrogator will protect classified IP data received from a non-approved COMSEC device to the extent practical.  Rescue force to rescue force two-way exchange of mission or IP data must be accomplished using the secure cryptographic architecture approved by NSA.  	The interrogator must be electromagnetically compatible within itself and with other systems in the operational environment.  It shall not be operationally degraded or fail due to exposure to electromagnetic environmental effects. The period of performance for this development effort is anticipated to be twelve (12) months after contract award.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of the Director (OD), Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) plans to procure on a sole source basis with John Wiley & Sons Inc. 111 River St., Suite 2000, Hoboken, NJ 07030 to publish an approximately 175 page, 24 article special supplement issue to the journal CANCER entitled:  National Cancer Institute Special Populations Networks: Achievements and Lessons, 2000-2005.  The purpose of this project is to provide the NCI-funded scientific community with a scientifically peer-reviewed report of the successes and lessons learned from the NCI-funded first five-year community-based participatory research program, The Special Populations Network in Cancer Awareness and Training.   The Special Populations Network Research Program constitutes the first five-year community-based participatory research program supported by the NCI to address the inequities in cancer mortality among specific populations with an excess burden of cancer.  This research program proved to be a successful first step in reaching and engaging disadvantaged communities to address the cancer disparities in these populations.  The lessons learned and research conducted in this program have tremendous significance for the other NCI-funded research programs and the cancer research community since it is the first time that these populations have experienced positive results from government funded research, and the first time since the Tuskegee Experiment was conducted in the 1950s the research community has been able to gain access to these populations.  CANCER (CA) shall publish a special issue detailing the achievements and outlining strategies and activities developed by the SPN program during its 5 years of innovative work.  NCI funded 18 SPNs during that period and the results from their efforts, reported in this Supplement, are substantial, unique, and impressive.  The accomplishments of the 18 SPNs have helped to resolve some of the trust issues that existed between minority communities and the scientific community, and provided momentum for the development of new approaches in community-based participatory research.  John Wiley & Sons Inc.,     shall provide NCI with:   1) production and distribution of the special issue to subscribers of the CANCER; and 2) 150 additional copies of the special supplement shall be provided to the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities for future distribution.  CANCER is a peer-reviewed journal with an extensive professional national and international readership.   John Wiley & Sons, Inc publication CANCER is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort as it is the only known major nationally recognized cancer research journal that has a large readership that reaches the specialized and specific audience in the research and medical community that this supplement is targeted to reach.  CANCER is subscribed to by the majority of the cancer research community and by all medical school and university libraries, as well as all minority-serving institutions.  CANCER is a peer-reviewed journal with an extensive professional national and international readership.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI end-user to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 2PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 9, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government?s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters? Agreement. 

The authority to authorize TECRO and its members for tax-relief privileges is an obligation of AIT in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.      

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.  Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host countr

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):  Non-personal Contract Service to Train and Equip a Company-size Foreign Military Unit in Africa Purpose/General Information: The United States Government, as part of market research, is requesting information from the industry on commercial sources for nonpersonal contracted services to train and equip a company-size, host nation military unit in central Africa.  The end state is to assist a host nation in Africa to establish a company-size military unit that is trained and equipped to perform information collection, analysis, synthesis, production, and dissemination.  To support this end state, the Government is interested in s urveying potential commercial sources for integrated capability to provide related training and commercial off the shelf (COTS) information technology hardware and application software, communication equipment, European-standard non-tactical vehicles, incl uding sustainment parts, and miscellaneous office equipment.  This effort would require the Government to acquire and transfer the specified property to the Host Nation. Contractor personnel will be required to have current US SECRET security clearance.  Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT A SOLICATION.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been r eceived for this proposal. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect c osts or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission or responses to this RFI or the Governments use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractors input resulting for t his RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available. Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements  of future projects and systems but will be safeguarded as marked. Submissions may be viewed by non-U.S. Government personnel.  RFI Questions: 1.	What are the major cost drivers for a train and equip project? 2.	What performance metrics should be used to in sourcing these two requirements? 3.	Considering cost factors, what is a reasonable on-time delivery rate for the times specified above? 4.	As opposed to an on-time delivery date, we consider a 100% fill rate of items before training begins; is this feasible? 5.	Retraining is an integral part of military operations. What is the best-fit model for re-training or re-equipping such a host nation organization? 6.	What are the cost advantages/disadvantages if separate contracts were utilized to support either the equip or train component of this project in lieu of an integrator? What if contracts were separated by region (CONUS/OCONUS)? 7.	Operations in Foreign Countries: This project will require the transfer of accountable property. Do you have any experience with such transfers (to include sensitive items) regarding transfer issues and have you had specific problems or requirements reg arding importation duties? 8..	What type[s] of contract[s] do you think would be best suited for this project? 9.	What type of contract incentives would you suggest to motivate contract performance? Classification: UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

The equipment listed above is required to provide encryption access to the OpenNet Plus Frame-Relay network by providing application level access to IT resources on OpenNet Plus. The SafeNet devices are essential to the State Departments requirements for maximum protection and utilization of the network security infrastructure over WAN connections.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments Open Net Plus Frame-Relay networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to award, on a sole-source basis to Hanan and Lerner, 9123 Hampton Overlook, Capitol Heights, MD 20743 the following requirement:



C1.	Background

Presently, FACS is responsible for maintaining and managing the buildings on the LOC Capitol Hill Campus which is comprised of The James Madison Memorial Building (1,900,000 SF), The John Adams Building (760,000 SF), and The Thomas Jefferson Building (660,000 SF), as well as The Landover Center Annex, (246,100SF), The Taylor Street Annex (88,630SF), St Cecelia?s Special Facility (39,662SF), FT. Meade Book Storage Modules (335,000SF) and NAVCC in Culpeper VA (420,000SF).  Facility Design and Construction (FD&C), as a unit of FACS performs the space planning, interior design and furnishing of all Library facilities.  Additionally, construction management is executed in conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol (AOC).   Projects managed by FD&C range in scope from the design of a secured collections storage facility to the refurbishing of a reading room to the renovation of a training center. Given the breadth of scope of work managed by FD&C, contract services must be delivered in a manner that speaks to the dynamic and comprehensive nature of FD&C?s service requirements.
C2.	Scope

	The intent of this solicitation is to obtain furniture repair, reupholstery and refinishing services for the LOC facilities located on Capitol Hill.  Services will be requested as required. 

C3.	Requirements
	
	The selected contractor will provide furniture installation and repair services.  FD&C will issue a Request for Quote for each task.  Submitted quotes will require a Request for Service and approval by the COTR.  These services are to include repair of systems furniture, wood furniture, antiques, as well as various furniture that is part of the LOC standard  and non-standard inventory.

A.	Kick Off Meeting:  The contractor will meet with the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR), and designated LOC contacts to review the program objectives, roles and responsibilities

B.	Review Meetings:  The contractor will meet regularly and on request with the COTR, to review and confirm the status of the services.  The contractor will maintain project documentation, including critical path alerts, action items, briefings and meeting minutes.

Personnel provided under this contract shall not be pending charges, shall not have been convicted of any felony within the last 10 years or any misdemeanor within the last five years (excepting minor motor vehicle infractions for which the individual paid a fine or posted collateral in the amount of $300 or less) which would indicate violent or disruptive conduct, dishonest conduct, untrustworthiness or unreliability which could reasonably affect performance on the contract or pose a security concern with respect to access to Library buildings or grounds, property or collections.  Note that the term ?convicted? would include a disposition of ?probation? or ?probation before judgment.?  Should any person employed by the contractor to perform work under this contract be convicted of any of the aforesaid offenses, the contractor agrees to remove the individual from the contract performance and return all Library building and stack passes issued to the individual.  The contractor also agrees to remove from the contract performance, any individual under pending charges for any felony or misdemeanor with exceptions noted above until such time as the final disposition is known.  Upon request of the Library, the contractor will identify personnel to be assigned to work under the contract and submit a FD-258 (contractor fingerprint chart) and any other necessary administrative forms provided by the Library so that a background check may be conducted.  The parties agree that the Library has final authority to determine the suitability of contractor personnel who perform work under this contract.  Nevertheless, the fact that the Library may conduct background checks on assigned contractor personnel does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide qualified, reliable personnel of sound character and conduct.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:

TRANSFORMATION OF FORTE COMPUTER CODE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.

Background

This is the third Request for Information (RFI) that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has issued regarding transformation of a software application written for the Sun Unified Development Server (UDS) environment, formerly known as Forte Transactional Object-Oriented Language (TOOL).  

DSCA is seeking to identify information technology vendors capable of transforming DSCA's source code into another programming language and is attempting to determine the target environments that are obtainable in the marketplace.

The first request was issued on Jan 30, 2004, on DSCA's behalf, by the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Technology Service and focused on cost and technical capabilities.  

The second request was issued by DSCA on June 2, 2006 and focused on the degree of vendor automation, particularly regarding screen transformation capability and prior volume of code transformed, and on corporation and employee nationality.  

This RFI seeks more explicit descriptions of the target architecture and environment and vendor preferences regarding certain terms and conditions of a potential future acquisition. Vendors can participate in this RFI regardless of whether they responded to the previous ones.  

Any future procurement will most likely be initiated in the Spring of 2007 with the objective of commencing work in or after October 2007.  (Failure to respond to this RFI will not result in down-selection or otherwise prohibit a vendor from future competition.)

DSCA's Challenge

DSCA has a large software application, called the Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS).  This application supports several business areas associated with the U.S. Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program such as preparation of the contracts between the U.S. and foreign governments and the planning, tracking, and financial management associated with bringing tens of thousands of foreign military personnel to Department of Defense (DoD) schools in the U.S.

DSAMS has roughly 900,000 lines of UDS-based TOOL executable source code that compile into 1 client executable and 3 server executables. Other elements of the application include an Oracle 9i database management system (soon to be upgraded to Oracle 10g), custom reports developed using the Cognos Impromptu report generator, and interfaces programmed in Perl.  

The current production hardware system architecture consists of 
(a)  a central HP RX7620 Integrity server (with Intel Itanium processors that provide hardware-based emulation to run RISC-based executables) running the HP-UX operating system, Oracle 9i RDBMS, UDS Runtime environment, most UDS-based DSAMS business logic (to include batch and on-line services), all Perl logic and 
(b)  an Intel-based Windows server farm running the UDS Runtime environment, UDS-based DSAMS presentation and business logic, Impromptu, and Citrix Metaframe to deliver fat client services to end users Wintel desktops via Citrix ICA client connections.

DSCA owns three versions of the DSAMS system.  The Production version is run in a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) data center in Oklahoma City, OK.  Also at that site is a Test and Training system used to formally test pending releases.  Finally, at DSCA's software development center, the Defense Security Assistance Development Center (DSADC) in Mechanicsburg, PA, DSCA operates a Development server.  Hardware and commercial software for DSAMS must thus be acquired in triplicate. 

DSCA wishes to migrate the UDS-based client and server portions of DSAMS to another language and runtime environment, while retaining the Oracle, Perl, and Impromptu elements of the system and the user experience of rich screens.  The central application server and operating system for the transformed application code need not remain HP and Unix.  The objective is to transform the UDS elements of the system at minimum cost and risk to a new, easily maintained environment that provides equal or improved performance and equivalent functionality.  DSCA is prepared to consider vendors offering both highly manual and highly automated transformation approaches.  However, our expectation is that a highly automated approach to code transformation will lead to minimum cost and defects and offer schedule advantages 

DSCA's Questions

Distributed throughout the following narrative are 25 questions, prefaced by a question number of the form (Qnn).  Vendors are requested to respond specifically to those 25 questions, by number.

DSAMS Program Phasing

DSAMS has been developed in three major phases:

The first two phases, known as the Case Development and Case Implementation Modules, were completed in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and have been in production ever since.  They are stable and their maintenance and enhancement levels are now low.

The third phase, known as the Training Module, was deployed to the Army and Navy in October 2006.  It is now in a post-deployment defect reduction phase. Current plans call for major enhancements to be developed in 2007 and 2008 that will allow deployment to the Air Force in October 2008.  In between these dates, and subsequent to October 2008, DSCA expects to be making a large number of software changes as problems are discovered in production, known residual defects are removed, and users define new features that would be helpful.

As designed, these three major modules, when compiled, result in one monolithic UDS application rather than two or more separately releasable pieces.  In the future, DSCA would prefer a more granular application structure.  This might require better configuration management tools than DSADC currently uses to manage the many pieces.

DSCA would like to complete the transformation from UDS as soon as possible after October 2008.  However, the ongoing construction of elements of the Training Module, necessary for Air Force deployment, creates a moving target for the transformation vendor.  Presumably, the application must be frozen for some period to allow the vendor time to transform it and the government time to test and accept it.  But that freeze must be much shorter than one year to allow DSCA to continue with necessary repairs and enhancements.  

Consequently, a highly automated approach to transformation is also desirable to minimize downtime for cut-over.  One possible sequence of events might be the following:  During late 2007 and all of 2008, the vendor can be perfecting the tools used for transformation, testing those tools on an interim version of the application, receiving interim feedback from DSCA on correctness of functionality, and ultimately completing a 100% transformation of that legacy code.  This would be called the "Pilot" transformation.  Then, around mid-2009, the legacy production application could be frozen, finally transformed, and tested, perhaps in a period of only a few months.  This would be called the "Final" transformation.  During the Final transformation and testing period, DSCA might be developing new enhancements or repairs to the application in the target environment, but not deploying them until after the final transformation has been accepted and placed in production.  

The above scenario is only one possible way to approach the problem of scheduling the transformation of a dynamic application.  
(Q01) Please recommend alternative scenarios that reflect the schedules and timelines that your tools and skills are capable of achieving.  Specifically address the time required for a Pilot transformation on a UDS application of 900,000 lines.  Specifically address the time required for a Final transformation, once a successful Pilot transformation has been achieved.

DSCA is concerned about the need to handle the simultaneous demands of improving the Training Module while also supporting and managing the UDS conversion vendor and conducting the acceptance testing of transformed code.
(Q02) Please describe the nature and amount of support that your firm will need from DSCA during the transformation process.  This should include the degree of functional expertise, on-site presence, and incremental testing activities that you require.  Also indicate whether your firm would need access to a dedicated version of the legacy system to which your firm could autonomously compare the transformed application for equivalency of function and performance.

Target Language and Development Environment      

DSCA is not completely neutral on the preferred target environment, but assumes that the logical choices are either Java/J2EE or Microsoft .Net (in C#.Net, Visual Basic.Net, or a combination).  In any event, DSCA would want to maintain the transformed code in a well-integrated and comprehensive Integrated Development Environment.  What matters to DSCA is that the transformed code and the Integrated Development Environment allow for highly productive development and maintenance in an easily learned language and that the transformation itself be of low cost and low risk.  DSCA believes that the .Net environment is likely to allow more subsequent productivity.  But DSCA also values low transformation cost, vendor transformation experience, and high degrees of automation; so other target environments may reduce cost and risk. 
 
Consequently, DSCA does not want to mandate a target language and environment at this juncture.  Rather it wants to determine what target languages, middleware, and development environments are available, what experience has been had with the .Net target, and the costs associated with adopting a specific target environment.  At this point, DSCA is unsure whether it will specify a target language and environment in any subsequent acquisition or whether it will leave these elements to be part of a "best value" decision based more on cost, degree of automation, ease of maintenance, and vendor experience.

Risk Management

DSCA wants to minimize the risks associated with this transformation.  Consequently respondents should comment on each of the following risk areas:

DSCA wants to minimize the government?s cost, schedule, and technical risk associated with this transformation.  DSCA's preference would be to have the job bid as a firm-fixed-price fixed-schedule award, payable after satisfactory acceptance testing of the Final transformation.  
(Q03) Please comment on whether your firm would be willing to accept a 100% payment only upon successful completion of the Final transformation acceptance test.  
(Q04) Please indicate whether your firm would accept a 50% payment at the successful completion of a Pilot transformation (where success is determined by DSCA acceptance testing) and 50% at the successful completion of the Final transformation.

DSCA would also like to minimize technical risk by employing a vendor that has an actual track record of prior accomplishment with the target language being promised.  However, it may be that the target language that DSCA ultimately deems most favorable requires a vendor with no prior experience.  So DSCA would like to learn the degree to which target languages have actually been achieved.  
(Q05) Please describe the target languages that your firm can deliver and the degree of experience, in both application count and legacy code volume (lines of code), that your firm has with such languages as targets for a UDS transformation.  

DSCA would also like to reduce integration risk by having the vendor acquire some or all of the necessary hardware, commercial software (including middleware and development environments), and installing them on a turn-key basis in the DSADC Development environment or at least in their own development environment.
(Q06) Please describe the degree to which your firm would serve as integrating contractor, delivering a turn-key solution to DSADC, rather than just performing a language conversion function.
(Q07) Does your firm have, or would your firm supply, the full development target environment needed at your site for the transformation job, to include hardware and commercial software for the client, application server, and database server and database management system?

DSCA would like to minimize risk that the transformed application performs noticeably worse than the legacy UDS application as regards on-line response time and batch cycle time.  Consequently, DSCA intends to establish some performance benchmarks on the legacy that the vendor would be expected to match or exceed as an element of acceptance testing.  
(Q08) Please describe your methods for controlling performance risk and your willingness to demonstrate that the transformed code will perform as well as the legacy application.
(Q09) How will the vendor determine what size application server should be provided to deliver this performance?

Maintainability    
 
Maintainability of the application after transformation is an important issue for DSCA.  DSCA expects to enhance the application continually over many years.  To minimize costs and maximize corporate knowledge, DSCA uses an in-house maintenance team, augmented as necessary by outsourced support.  DSCA expects to provide between 25% and 75% of maintenance in-house, depending on other DSADC missions and the demands for changes to DSAMS.  

To facilitate early assumption of maintenance duties by the current DSAMS maintenance staff, it would be easiest if attribute names, method names, class names, and embedded comments were preserved.  
(Q10) Please describe the degree to which this could occur.  
(Q11) Please indicate if the vendor anticipates employing extensive code refactoring in a manner that would change the object class organization (perhaps in return for improved performance or markedly lower code line count).
(Q12) Please indicate if refactoring is an option DSCA can choose to accept or reject.  
(Q13) Please indicate if tools and/or documents could be furnished to assist the maintenance work force in navigating from the legacy program object class structure to the new one.  Describe those tools or documents.

DSCA wants to understand the costs of ownership of the development and run-time environment associated with the transformed software.
(Q14) Please indicate the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and run-time environment in which the transformed application would be maintained and operated.  Or what commercially available IDEs would be suitable for maintaining the transformed system?
(Q15) Please provide an itemized list of the estimated initial and recurring costs of any licenses for middleware, application server software, and development suites associated with the target environments you can deliver.  Also recommend and provide estimated costs for any appropriate automated regression testing software and configuration management software.

Architectural Issues

Vendors may have tools that could migrate the UDS code to Java, .Net, or both. While presumably any target environment and any solution to infrastructure issues is possible with a sufficient expenditure of labor, DSCA seeks to learn about the specifics of the automated tools that might be used as regards the target environment.  Consequently we request that the vendor respond to the following questions:

(Q16) If your tool can convert the UDS code to Java, please indicate if you can convert specifically to a J2EE-compliant version of Java.  What version of J2EE?  Does this capability already exist in your tool or is some adaptation of your tool required?


(Q17) If your tool can convert UDS to a .Net environment, would it be C#.Net, Visual Basic.Net, either, or some other language?  Do these capabilities already exist in your tool or is some adaptation of your tool required?

(Q18) Please indicate whether the application resulting from the use of your tool would be web-based in the sense that a user would employ a browser to access the application.  Or would the resulting application employ a "fat client" that the users might access via Citrix as with the legacy version? If web-based, would you expect that the application could be moved from client/server to web architecture without additional design work and manual coding?

(Q19) If a "fat client" design is to be used, please specify whether it would employ SWING and Abstract Windows Toolkit, JFace and the Standard Widget Toolkit, AJAX, third party widgets, or specific J2EE or .Net libraries not included in the base environment?  If a "fat client" design is to be used, please describe what underlying technologies would be used to handle communications between client-side and server-side objects.

(Q20) Certain DSAMS infrastructure services (e.g., highlighter, Data Manager) have been custom developed in UDS TOOL code for the legacy application.  Some of these might have counterparts in the libraries available with the target environment.  Please indicate whether the vendor would automatically transform the custom legacy infrastructure services or would replace them with the analogous library services.

(Q21) Please indicate what protocols and standards would be employed in the transformed system?  Would a Service Oriented Architecture be used?  If so, would it comply with XML, SOAP, and WSDL standards?  Would the middleware services (e.g., object brokers, messaging middleware) be provided by some underlying commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) runtime environment, perhaps provided by a specific COTS application server?

(Q22) Please indicate if a specific operating system would be needed to run the transformed software or the development environment.

DSAMS currently uses a custom Data Manager (one of the infrastructure elements cited in Q20 above) to provide mapping between objects and relational data entities.  
(Q23) Please indicate specifically how would you move data from the relational database management system to the object-oriented structure and back? How would data integrity be assured in the multi-user environment.  What persistence mechanisms would be employed if a web-based presentation is used?

Security

As currently designed, DSAMS handles user authentication and role-based permission management using custom UDS code and Oracle tables.  
(Q24) Please indicate how user-related security services would be handled, to include password encryption.  Would some or all of this be replaced by library routines?

(Q25) As regards the user screens resulting from the transformation, please describe how defenses against data entry attacks such as buffer overflow or SQL injection would  be handled.  Would the vendor add protections via custom code or existing libraries?  Or would the level of editing in the legacy application simply be preserved?

retardant tank shall be a minimum of 2500 gallons. The work includes design, analysis, installation and testing of the aircraft for conversion to wildland firefighting using a retardant tank. The resultant airtanker conversion shall meet the performance requirements of the Interagency Airtanker Board. Conversion of the aircraft shall occur at the contractor?s facility.

Requirements: The retardant delivery system shall be of new manufacture, externally mounted and a gravity flow design. The retardant delivery system performance shall meet the Interagency Airtanker Board tank system criteria which can be viewed at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/airtankers/iab_procedures/iab_procedures_sec_vii_tank_system.pdf.

The installation of the
tank/retardant delivery system shall not alter the speed restrictions of an OEM, as delivered, non modified aircraft by more than ten (10) percent.

Tank Capacity:The capacity of the retardant delivery system shall remain within the Manufacturer or FAA approved normal weight limitations and center of gravity configuration for the aircraft. The approximate volume of the retardant tank should be 2500 to 3000 gallons based on a retardant weight of 9 lbs. per gallon. The

<SUBJECT>J -- D-OMB Circular A-76: Department of Defense Public-Private Competition of Air Operations Services at Navy Installations throughout the Continental United States
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  The Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), United States Navy is conducting market research as part of the preliminary planning phase of OMB Circular A-76 and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  The purpose of this preliminary planning market research is to seek industry assistance in determining the appropriate grouping of commercial functions into business units, determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for those functions, and confirm whether sources would be available to satisfy agency requirements should there be a standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract will NOT result from this market research but one or more separate solicitations MAY be issued in the future.
Research Method: The method for conducting market research for this requirement will be principally through this Request For Information (RFI) and the attached questionnaire (Attachment A).  As required, telephone interviews and discussions with potential commercial sources and industry experts may be conducted.  The attached questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of this research.  This RFI is NOT a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

Information on Scope of Services:  This RFI concerns the provision of ground electronics maintenance at 28 locations, flight planning services at 20 locations and the operation of Type II Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Air Traffic Control Facilities (ATCF) at 9 locations in seven Navy Regions throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), as described below.  Specific locations are listed in the table at Attachment 1.  The initial work breakdown structure (WBS) grouping of activities is included with this RFI as Attachment 2.
  Explanation of Services ? Ground Electronics Maintenance:  Ground electronics maintenance (GEM) performs preventive and corrective maintenance to ensure that airfield, air traffic control, communications and all other designated electronics equipment operate at designed performance standards.  GEM ensures that test equipment is calibrated in accordance with applicable Navy and OEM manufacturer directives. 
The specific electronics equipment may vary at each installation.  A detailed list of the specific electronics equipment at each location will be provided in any solicitation which may be issued as a result of preliminary planning.  In general, electronics equipment will include, but may not be limited to, Naval air traffic control, air navigation aids and landing systems (NAALS) equipment (such as but not limited to radar and video systems, communications and data systems, NAVAIDS and facility systems, improved and original Fresnel lens optical landing systems, mobile visual landing aids systems and precision approach path indicator systems), FM mobile communications systems, weather systems and test equipment.  Electronics equipment may also include alarm systems, public safety FM radio support and other systems designated at specific locations.  Electronics equipment shall be maintained in accordance with applicable Navy and OEM manufacturer directives.
  Operation of Type II / VFR Air Traffic Control Towers:  Provide VFR ATC services including air traffic sequencing to aircraft airborne within the airport traffic area, authorization for aircraft to land or take off from runways or heliports, and control of aircraft and vehicles on the surface within the movement area to ensure safe, orderly, and expeditious movement of landing and departing aircraft during hours specified at each location.  Unless modified by letter of agreement, ATC clearance authority vested in the Class II Tower is limited to VFR operations, although Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Special VFR clearances originated by other facilities having such authority, may be relayed.  Flight Planning or flight assistance services shall also be provided where specified.
Flight Planning Services:  The flight planning branch of an ATCF is responsible for processing flight plans and aircraft movement messages, maintaining records of arriving and departing aircraft, stocking navigational publications, providing Notices to Airman (NOTAM) information, and assisting aviators with filing flight plans.  Flight planning is usually the only part of an ATCF to have personal contact with the pilots who receive ATC service.

Market Research: The Government requests that interested sources complete and submit the attached questionnaire to the Government Contracting Officer, Ms. Laurie Cordell, at laurie.cordell@navy.mil not later than 4:00 PM (EST), 23 February 2007. Responses received after this date and time may not be reviewed.

<DESC>D - DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION, TESTING, IMPLEMENTATION, DEPLOYMENT, TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE NEXT GENERATION IDENTIFICATION (NGI)- NOTIFICATION OF POSTING OF DOCUMENTS

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been preparing for the Next Generation Identification (NGI) Program via a full and open competitive acquisition.  On October 26, 2006, the FBI posted Request for Information (RFI) Number 0147930 to provide interested vendors with information regarding the upcoming NGI Program and to obtain vendor feedback.  Based on feedback from the vendor community, the FBI is making every effort to provide additional information and communication with the government throughout the acquisition process.  On January 17-18, 2007, the FBI held an Industry Day Conference to provide additional information to the vendor community regarding the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division and its information technology environment as well as the NGI Program.  During the Industry Day Conference, the FBI indicated it would post the Industry Day presentation materials as well as other documents associated with the NGI Program on FEDTEDS.GOV.  The FBI also indicated a videotape of the Industry Day presentations would be made available at the Vendor Library located at the CJIS Division Visitor Center.  This videotape is now available.  Vendors must make an appointment to view the videotape.  Appointments must be made through the Contract Administration Office (CAO) at (304) 625-3880.  The list of attendees and the questions and answers from Industry Day will be posted at a later date.  The FBI will be posting materials associated with the program in stages over the next few months.  Notification of additional materials being posted on FEDTEDS.GOV and/or available at the CJIS Division Vendor Library will always be made via the Fedbizopps website.  Materials posted on FEDTEDS.GOV will utilize the reference number NGI0147930.

This is formal notification that documents have been posted associated with the NGI Program.  This posting includes the Industry Day presentations.  Please be advised that modifications to the presentations may have been made for security reasons.  In order to access documents posted on FEDTEDS.GOV under link NGI0147930, vendors must request to be added as an interested party by notifying the following designated government Points of Contact:

Ellen Oliveto
Phone:  (304) 625-4289
eoliveto@leo.gov

Greg Robe
Phone:  (304) 625-4912
grobe1@leo.gov

At the time of the request, each vendor will be required to provide the DUNS #/Cage Code under which they have registered on FEDTEDS and verify they have completed the appropriate Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) form.  The NDA form shall be signed by a corporate executive and an Attachment A shall be completed for each individual within the company who is requesting access to the documents.  NOTE:  Those who have completed the NDA for Industry Day do not have to sign another NDA.  Copies of the NDAs countersigned by the FBI will be provided at a later date.

Vendors who have registered previously for the RFI must request to be added as an interested party for the new FEDTEDS link, NGI0147930.  There will be no automatic roll-over.  Public domain links will be available on FEDTEDS for vendors to access documents via the internet.

Reminder:  Each individual requesting access to the documents must first successfully register on FEDTEDS.  Help links are available on the FEDTEDS.GOV homepage.

The sole point of contact for the NGI Program is Susan J. Smith, Contracting Officer, at (304) 625-2441 or susmith@leo.gov.  For all matters relating to FEDTEDS, contact Ellen Oliveto or Greg Robe.

<DESC>DHS S&T will consider a broad range of technologies but this HSARPA BAA focuses on the high risk/high payoff development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than advances in basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components. Instead, they may be new or existing technologies integrated into existing systems and/or subsystems in unique and innovative ways. Offerors should demonstrate that their efforts are aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 2-5 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to homeland security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that developments in these areas must work towards the goal of producing an operational demonstration during which the SAFECON products will interact seamlessly with existing commercial systems and processes.  An initial capability demonstration is desirable within the first six months after contract award.

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation procurement and a total small business set aside.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) number HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913 is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to obtain Strategic Management Support Services for the Transportation Security Administration.


****************************************************************


This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA ? Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority. 


****************************************************************


All interested vendors must contact TSA's Office of Acquisition (OA) for a copy of the RFP, which contains the instructions, Statement of Work, Past Performance Survey, and Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The RFP contains all Evaluation Factors that will be used by TSA in considering the technical merit of each response. The RFP also contains instructions on the format of responses, including page length.  All interested offerors are hereby made aware that in order to be considered, they must submit a technical and price proposal that covers all aspects of the SOW, not selected parts of the SOW.  However, TSA is willing to consider the merit of any proposed subcontracting or teaming arrangements meeting the Limitations in Subcontracting requirements.  

TSA's primary point of contact is Ms. Quyen Diep, who can be reached at 571-227-2997 or e-mail at Quyen.Diep@dhs.gov.  If Ms. Diep is not available, please contact Mr. Marvin Grubbs at 571-227-1581 or e-mail at Marvin.Grubbs@dhs.gov.    Please contact Ms. Diep NO LATER THAN February 9, 2007 to receive a copy of the RFP via e-mail only. Any questions about this synopsis/solicitation shall be directed in writing to Ms. Diep.  The deadline to submit a technical and price proposal is indicated in the RFP letter and will not be extended unless the Contracting Officer determines that an extension is necessary to maintain the competitive nature of the procurement.


****************************************************************


AMENDMENT TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to questions submitted between January 26 and January 30, 2007.

***Question 1: Please clarify whether the proposal page count restriction includes pages such as the title/ cover page, Table of Contents, and other pages usually used to delineate or organize a document?  

Answer 1: The page count restriction includes pages such as title/cover page, table of contents and those used to delineate or organize the proposal document.

***Question 2: Does the TSA/DHS secure services from GSA schedules?  We hold GSA contracts encompassing strategic management support.  

Answer 2: This is not a GSA schedule procurement.  

***Question 3: Specifically, the issue addresses the Government's intent of the Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) requirement, Page 8, Attachment A; which states:  "This procurement contains a potential OCI.  The awardee and all subcontractors/team partners will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within the SOW. An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered."  Can we interpret the following statement to be equivalent?  "This procurement contains a potential OCI.  The awardee and all subcontractors/team partners will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to tasks which they are awarded under this BPA.  An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered."  We understand the requirement for restrictions on any follow-on (or otherwise competitively sought) work that could be influenced by work conducted under a specific task order under this procurement.  As this procurement (HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913) is expected to generate multiple tasks and procurement actions, we would like to confirm the OCI restrictions would apply only to those organizations who specifically undertook work under any specific task, and not restrict others who happen to be members of the Prime Contractors team.  

Answer 3: The OCI restriction applies to the prime contractor as well as their subcontractor/team partners who have been awarded tasks under the resultant BPA.

***Question 4: Are you taking any meetings with vendors?  

Answer 4: No.

***Question 5: Is there an incumbent on this?  

Answer 5: No, TSA-wide strategic management is a new endeavor.

***Question 6: With the new release on FBO, is the RFP exactly the same as it was when it was sent to the small businesses previously.  
Answer 6: The only difference in the RFP released on January 17, 2007 and the RFP posted on Fed Biz Opps on January 26, 2007 is in the anticipated milestone schedule for the procurement (see the ?ACQ913 RFP letter.doc? file).

***Question 7: Regarding ACQ913 Attach 2, "Past Performance Survey", page 3, Customer Satisfaction, Item 4, I interpret this form is to be used with past or current contracts performed for Federal Agencies.  Is this correct?  In our case we have no prior federal government contract experience or references.  What should we use?  Our work with private sector companies is covered under non-disclosure agreements that precludes any reference.  In the event we could get a waiver and a client would agree to disclosure, would this be the form we would use?  

Answer 7: The Past Performance Survey can be used for past and current work with the Federal Government as well as the private sector.

***Question 8: Was there a sources sought released prior to this solicitation that assisted the TSA in the making the decision to release this Solicitation as a small business set-aside?  If so, could you advise how many small businesses responded?  

Answer 8: A sources sought was not released prior to the solicitation.

***Question 9: Must the small business prime accomplish at least 51% of the work?  If the answer is yes, can this requirement be satisfied by the small business prime and other small business subcontractors collectively accomplishing 51% of the work?  

Answer 9: At least 50% of the cost of contract performance must be expended by the small business prime contractor.  This applies per task order awarded.

***Question 10: Must the proposing small business have the related experience/past performance or can the small business rely on large and/or small business subcontractors past performance to qualify?  

Answer 10: As 51% of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor and the RFP letter states that the most important evaluation factor is ?demonstrated specialized experience? in the areas listed, it is expected the small business prime contractor have the required experience.  You may submit past performance from your subcontractors that augments the overall past performance for the teaming arrangement but the small business prime contractor must possess the required experience.

***Question 11: Is there any possibility that this Requirement will be released (1) under either another NAICS Code or (2) as ?Full and Open??  

Answer 11: Depending on the responses received, TSA may consider a different NAICS code for the procurement.

***Question 12: We have read the RFP and conclude that the available pool of respondents as a Small Business set-aside under 541611 will be relatively shallow. Most entities will need to team with much larger firms to meet the requirements as stated within.  

***Answer 12: The RFP states that offerors may elect to enter into a teaming arrangement to fulfill the requirements. 

***Question 13: Would MOBIS schedule holders be a more representative pool [to solicit]?  

Answer 13: This is not a GSA schedule procurement.

***Question 14: Does the BPA that results from this solicitation need to be attached to a GSA schedule, and if so which schedule?  

Answer 14: This is not a GSA schedule procurement.

<CONTACT>Joann Walker, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-707-0467, Fax 202-707-8611, Email jwalker@loc.gov
<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to negotiate non competitively with BAE Systems Inc., 2525 Network Place, Herdon, Virginia 20171.  The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) of the Library of Congress administers a free library service to eligible residents of the United States and citzens living abroad who cannot hold, handle, or read traditional print media because of visual or physical handicaps.  NLS is now in the process of transitioning from an analog system to a digital system for distributing audio books and magazines to its libraries.  Plans for this transition are in Current Strategic Business Plan for the Implementation of Digital System, December 2003. The core of this new system is the Digital Talking Book (DTB). In 2009, NLS anticipates the creation of "duplicate on demand" centers which would be tow or more special off site facilities that can take requests for a particular title from a remote library, download it from web site, and then "duplicate" a number of these titles on to flash memory cartridges for the library that requested it.  NLS presently makes use of an in-house design, legacy, computer system called the Production Information Control System (PICS). This computer system has been in use since 1992, and was developed specifically to facilitate the management of information associatd with the production f all book and magazine materials produced by NLS for it patrons.  This system is essential to the proper and efficient operation of NLS production, and presently is configured for the present analog production environment.  In order to support the new totally digital environment, NLS anticipates it will need to modify its PICS software to acommodate the purely digital production of DTB's and to work in a totally digital production environment.  NLS engaged in an analysis and design of the modifications to the PICS system in order for the PICS system to work in this enviroment. This analysis was performed at the end of the 2006 by BAE Systems Inc. under contract LCNLS060129.  The procurement deals with the work necesary to take this high level design and implement these modifications, with the sole exception of the new copy allotment process, which will be implemented as a separate task. 

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; HOWEVER, ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT IS EITHER LEGALLY INCORPORATED AS U.S. BUSINESS ENTITY, OR IS CAPABLE OF DEMONSTRATING THROUGH ITS BUSINESS PLAN ITS INTENTION TO FULLY INCORPORATE AS A U.S. BUSINESS; AND BELIVES IT CAN MEET THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SPECIFICATIONS NOTED, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE LIBRARY?S SYSTEM, AND WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AN COST TO THE GOVERNMENT, IS INVITED TO APPLY TO THE LIBRARY FOR CONSIDERATION.

<DESC>Continuation/completion of the Statement of Work

7. When a drug testing event must be rescheduled, the DPC and the contractor will determine a new collection date.  

8. The collector(s) shall arrive at the Government testing site not later than 15 minutes before the collections are scheduled.  In the event the contractor does not arrive for the scheduled collection in a timely manner and is not ready to begin collections at the scheduled time, the contractor will be liable for liquidated damages for one drug test (of the type of test scheduled) for every 15 minutes the collector is not ready, up to a maximum liability of two drug tests/collections.  If the collector does not appear at the Government collection site, the contractor will be liable for the cost of two drug tests (of the type scheduled for collection).

9. In the event the contractor arrives at the Government collection site on schedule but no donor is present, ready, and available for a collection, the USUHS shall pay the contractor the contract price for one drug test (of the type of test scheduled) for the first complete 30 minutes that no donor is present, ready, and available for collection.  The USUHS liability is limited to the price of one test.  After one hour of delay, the contractor, at its option, may leave the site.

10. Random, Volunteer, and Follow-up Collections - For these types of collections, the DPC will provide the contractor with the number of employees scheduled and the specific start time at least five (5) calendar days prior to the drug testing event.  The DPC may request that the collector personnel be a specific gender, if deemed necessary.  The contractor shall adhere strictly to the schedule established and given by the DPC and shall be prepared to begin collections at the requested times.  The date, time and number of collections should not be disclosed to any other personnel not directly involved with the collection.  Upon arrival at the collection site, the DPC will give the collector the donor name and time of collection for each collection.  This information shall remain confidential.

11. Pre-employment Collections - drug testing is required of all individuals tentatively selected for a Testing Designated Position (TDP).  Pre-employment collections may be conducted at a Government or a contractor site as determined by the DPC.  The contractor will provide the DPC with a list of non-government drug testing facilities within the Washington, DC metropolitan area that can conduct drug testing for USUHS/AFRRI employees and/or applicants.  If the applicant is outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the DPC will notify the contractor as early as possible but in any case at least 24 hours in advance of a pre-employment drug test.  In exceptional cases, the contractor may be asked to conduct a test in less than 24 hours after notification by the DPC when possible.  The DPC shall notify the contractor of the name, social security number, gender, earliest date for testing, and city and state of applicant to be tested.  If the collection is to take place at a contractor site, the contractor shall furnish the DPC with a local point-of-contact's name and telephone number for the pre-employment test.  The contractor will coordinate with the DPC to schedule a specific time and place.  Applicants do not have the authority to change the drug test date, time, or location.  If the applicant requests a change, the contractor is to direct the applicant to the DPC.  If the applicant does not appear for testing within one (1) hour of the scheduled time, the DPC must be notified immediately.

12. Reasonable Suspicion and Accident or Unsafe Practice Collections - these types of collections may be conducted at a contractor site or another location as determined by the DPC.  Reasonable suspicion is authorized when management has a reasonable suspicion that any employee in a TDP is using drugs illegally.  Employees in a non-TDP may onlntract in accordance with HHS Guidelines.  Appropriate follow-on training for specific collectors is required on all collections not tested due to a fatal flaw or correctable flaw collection and when DPCs deem collector performance or behavior is inappropriate.  The training shall include formal instruction, mock/practice collections, observation of an experience collector at a random testing collection event and instruction on security of information and documents.  The contractor shall document training and retain records of all training for collector personnel which may be reviewed by the USUHS DPC or other appropriate USUHS or Department of Defense (DoD) Officials.

4. The contractor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all licenses required in the accomplishment of the work specified.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to work with the DPC to obtain passes for the collectors.

5. Problem Resolution. The contractor and the USUHS DPC will meet on a semi-annual basis to discuss contract performance issues.  Meetings shall be in person or by conference call and shall be determined by the DPC.  Serious contract performance issues may require additional meeting with the contractor, DPC, and USUHS Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  Problems with collection personnel will be handled through consultation, memos, and/or electronic messages to the contractor.

6. The contractor representative will be available for contact on a daily basis on normal work days which is defined as Monday through Friday (except federal holidays), between the hours of 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. and because of emergency collection activity and the location of USUHS DPC, the contractor representative will also need to be available at other times.  The contractor representative must be able to be reached by DPCs seven (7) days a week, 24 hours per day for reasonable suspicion or accident/unsafe practice testing.

7. The contractor representative will monitor collection activities as required for quality assurance and shall evaluate the work of the collectors.

8. The contractor representative will interface with the urinalysis laboratory.  This interaction will involve exchange of procedural and technical information, tracking of specimens, and completion of certificates of correction.  This communication shall be conducted and conveyed to the USUHS DPC.  The contractor must use laboratories certified by HHS to perform drug testing for Federal agencies. 

9. Collection personnel.  The contractor shall ensure that personnel assigned to perform urine specimen collections are aware of the sensitivity of the testing program and deal with the donors in a professional and cooperative manner, similar to expectations in a routine medical care setting, e.g., a physician's office.  Collection personnel must be able to answer routine questions about collection procedures.  Any questions concerning receipt of a drug test results must be directed to the DPC.  Collection personnel must pass any training provided by the prime contractor.  In the event that HHS mandates a training program, all collection personnel must pass this program.

C. Collections

1. The contractor shall provide for collection of urine specimens from USUHS/AFRRI civilian employees and applicants located throughout the world.  USUHS conducts six types of tests: random, voluntary, reasonable suspicion, accident or unsafe practice, and follow-up.

2. The contractor shall have the laboratory to test urine specimens for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).  In the case of reasonable suspicion or accident or unsafe practice testing, urine specimens shall be tested for any drugs listed in Schedules I and II of 21 U.S.C S202, 802(6), and 812 (attachment 1).  The laboratory must be certified by HHS.   

3. Single specimen collection is the normal collection method in USUHS and the Department of Defense (DoD).  Split specimen collection is only performed with DPC approval.

D. Collection Site

1. Designation - collection sites shall be designated by the USUHS DPC.

2. Specifications - the Government or the contractor collection site is the location for specified employees or applicants to present themselves for the purpose of providing their urine specimens under controlled conditions.  The collection site must have rest room facilities, which are clean, well lighted, and sufficiently secure to prevent compromise during the collection of urine specimens. The contractor is to notify the DPC immediately if a site fails to meet the above requirements so that immediate correction can be made (e.g. light burnt out in rest room).

3. The contractor shall be responsible for preparing the rest rooms for collection activities.  This may include taping all water sources.  

4. The contractor shall assure the portion of the facility being used for collection is secured during drug collection operations.  No unauthorized personnel shall be permitted in any part of the collection site where urine specimens are collected or stored.

5. If there is a disagreement as to whether the collection site meets the contract requirements, the DPC determination shall be final.

6. Government Collection Sites - generally, the collection site will be at one of the USUHS/AFRRI duty locations.  Random, voluntary, and follow-up collection will be conducted at a USUHS or AFRRI site or at a government site, unless otherwise authorized by the DPC.  

7. Contractor Collection Site - In unusual circumstances when a government facility does not meet the established collection site specifications, the DPC will arrange with the contractor for an outside collection site.  The contractor may be asked to recommend a location that is reasonably accessible 
to employees and applicants and meets the above collection site specifications.  In these cases, USUHS retains final approval authority.  

8. Pre-employment testing - the DPC may ask the contractor to recommend a location that is reasonably accessible to the applicant.  Reasonable accessible is defined as within one hour's driving time of the applicant or at a site in a major metropolitan city.  For purposes of this contract, major metropolitan area is defined as a metropolitan statistical area with a population greater than 150,000.  The contractor will provide a list of non-government drug testing facilities within the Washington, DC metropolitan area that can conduct drug testing for USUHS/AFRRI employees and/or applicants.

9. Reasonable suspicion and post-accident or unsafe practice testing may be conducted at a contractor collection site or another location (e.g. hospital) as specified by the DPC.  The DPC coordinating with site personnel will have final approval of the collection site.

E. Scheduling Collections

1. Collections may take place any time during a 24 hour day and any day of the week.  This means that collections will not be restricted to normal working hours, i.e., 6:00 a.m. to 5:00p.m., Monday through Friday.  However, normally collections will be conducted during the normal workday.

2. The DPC is responsible for managing the actual scheduling, rescheduling of the dates and times and sites for collections and individual collections with the contractor.  The DPC will notify the contractor of drug testing dates and times via telephone, fax, e-mail, or other method agreed upon.

3. The contractor will notify the DPC within 24 hours after the receipt of a request for drug testing to resolve scheduling conflicts and confirm the collection time and date.  The DPC will perform all donor notifications.  The contractor shall not unilaterally cancel or reschedule a collection.

4. In scheduling collection times, the contractor must recognize that if a donor(s) is unable to provide a specimen when first requested, the contractor will notify the DPC immediately.  The donor is required to remain at the collection site until ready to provide a specimen.  When a donor is unable to provide a specimen, the following procedures shall apply:

	a. When other collections are scheduled at the same location to be performed by the same collector, the contractor shall perform these collections while waiting for the unsuccessful donor to provide a specimen.

	b. The contractor need not wait more than four (4) hours beyond the last collection for a donor to provide a specimen at a Government collection site.  The contractor may impose a fee to USUHS for additional wait time.  The fee will equal one test (of the type being collected) per 30 minutes of wait time.  The wait time will start 30 minutes after the last scheduled collection.  The USUHS liability shall not exceed the price of eight collections (four hours).  If the donor provides a specimen within 30 minutes of the last scheduled collection, the fee will not be imposed.

c. The DPC may, at his/her option, order the contractor to cancel the collection at any time.  The above wait time fees will be imposed.

5. During drug testing at a USUHS/AFRRI collection site, the DPC will normally be present to answer any donor questions during the collection process or in the event of a shy bladder situation.  If the DPC can not be present, a telephone or other means of contacting the DPC must be made available to the collector(s).  Any problems occurring during a collection will be documented and forwarded to the DPC.

6. Although every effort is made to complete collections on the date and time scheduled, there are a variety of circumstances requiring postponement and rescheduling of collections.  If the DPC must cancel an on-site collection after it has been scheduled and confirmed with the collector, the DPC shall do so as early as practicable, but in any case at least 24 hours before the scheduled collection event.  Collections scheduled at the contractor's site that must be canceled should be done as soon as practicable.  Collections must be canceled by telephone either confirming verbally with the prime contractor or by leaving a voice and an e-mail message.  If the cancellation is after normal working hours Eastern Standard Time (normal working hours is defined in section E.1), the DPC shall contact the contractor by pager or cell phone.  Fees may be imposed on USUHS for Government site collections cancelled in less than 24 hours.  The fee will be the cost of one drug test (of the type scheduled).  There will be no fees assessed for cancelled contractor site collections.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK: 

A. General Description

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the President's Executive Order (E.O.) 12564 address the goals of establishing a drug-free workplace for the public and private sector. The E.O. 12564 directed agencies to establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions.  

The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires a contractor to perform drug testing for USUHS and Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI) employees in accordance with:  a) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs ( 53 Federal Register-FR 1979, 59 FR 29908, 63 FR, No. 219, and FR volume 69, No. 71); b) HHS Medical Review Officer Manual for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs; c) HHS Urine Specimen Collection Handbook for the New Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (OMB Number 0930?0158, Exp Date: June 30, 2003); the Statement of Work herein; and e) USUHS Drug-Free Workplace Program Instruction 1412 (May 27, 2004).

The Secretary of HHS or his/her designee may routinely update the HHS Guidelines for the purpose of providing additional guidance.  The contractor shall be required to obtain and comply with updates of the HHS Guidelines as they are issued.

USUHS conducts urinalysis testing to detect and deter illegal drug use by its civilian employees.  USUHS is required to conduct random, reasonable suspicion, accident or unsafe practice, pre-employment, volunteer, and follow-up drug testing.  This contract will provide for collection of urine specimens from USUHS/AFRRI civilians and applicants for USUHS Testing Designated Positions (TDP).  There are approximately 110 civilian employees in the USUHS/AFRRI drug testing pool.  The testing rate for random testing of TDPs is 100% of the TDP pool per year. 

B. Program Management
	
1. The following are key positions which are important to the functioning of the Drug-Free Workplace Program (DFWP):

Drug Program Coordinator (DPC) is responsible for overall management and guidance for the civilian DFWP.  Serve as the principal contact with the contractor and contract collection personnel, ensuring the effective operations of the collection process of the program.  Alternate DPCs may act in the place of the DPC.   

Medical Review Officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse disorders. MRO responsibilities include: 1) receipt, review, and interpretation of all negative, positive and non-negative test results confirmed by the laboratory; and 2) examination of alternative medical explanations for a positive, adulterated, substituted or invalid test result.

Laboratory is responsible for urinalysis of the specimen.

Contractor Program Manager is responsible for the overall administration of this contract.  He/she
shall identify levels of authority that will be the contractor's authorized representative for technical and administrative performance of all services required in the contract.  He/she will provide the USUHS DPC or responsible official with a regular and toll free telephone number for contacting the contractor representative during business hours and/or a pager or cell telephone number.  A regular and/or toll free fax number and an e-mail address will also be provided.

Contractor Representative is responsible for the day-to?day operations of this contract.

Collectors are responsible for collecting urine specimens for drug testing.

2. On a semi-annual basis the contractor and USUHS DPC will discuss contract performance issues.  The contractor shall provide information and written reports to the DPC concerning the work being performed under this contract, as requested. 

3. Contractor Training - The contractor shall establish a formal training program for contractor personnel involved in urine collection and urine transportation under this coy be tested when management has a reasonable suspicion that the employee is using drugs illegally on-duty or performing work while drug-impaired.  Accident or Unsafe Practice may also be called post?-accident testing.  Employees may be subject to testing when, based upon the circumstances of the on-the-job accident or unsafe, on-duty, job-related activity, their actions are reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed to an accident or unsafe practice.

	a. Reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing have often been termed emergency testing due to the short time frame available for scheduling the collection.  Such requests may occur at any time or day of the week and at any location.  The contractor shall respond as expeditiously as possible after notification from the DPC or other authorized USUHS official.  The DPC will notify the contractor by telephone, pager, or cell phone to schedule a collection.  Official requesting documentation via fax (or electronic e?mail) will follow this conversation.  The contractor shall notify the DPC of the collection time within one (1) hour of receiving the request for collection.  A collection team may be used and a same gender collector is required in the event an observed collection is necessary.

	b. Whenever practicable, a post-accident or unsafe practice collection shall be completed within two (2) hours of the accident/incident.  Two (2) hours from the accident/incident is the desired time frame; however, this is dependent on the timing of the notification that a collection is required.  Five (5) hours from notification is the maximum time frame.

	c. Whenever practicable, a reasonable suspicion collection shall be completed within two (2) hours of the request for collection, but not later five (5) hours. 

F. Collection Procedures

1. All collection procedures shall be adhered to whether at the Government collection site or the contractor collection site and will follow the HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.2 Specimen Collection Procedures.

2. The collector(s) shall arrive at the Government collection site not later than 15 minutes before collections are scheduled to begin in order to prepare the site.  The contractor is responsible for being ready to perform collections at the scheduled time.  The collector(s) shall provide identification to the DPC.  The DPC will provide the collectors with a list of donors and their arrival time.  Failure of a donor to report for testing and the inability to adhere to the schedule shall be reported immediately to the DPC.

3. Upon the donor's arrival at the Government or the contractor collection site, the collector shall identify themselves to the donor and request the donor to present some type of photo identification. If the donor does not have proper identification, the collector shall determine if the DPC can positively identify the donor.

4. If the donor fails to appear at the assigned time, the collector shall contact the DPC for guidance. Pre-employment donors must arrive within one (1) hour of the collection time.  Collectors must notify the DPC immediately when a donor fails to arrive on time.

5. Upon receiving the specimen container from the donor, the collector shall determine whether it contains at least 30 milliliters of urine and preferably 45 milliliters of urine.  If there is not sufficient urine, the DPC shall be notified immediately that a second specimen is required.  The DPC or collector will instruct the donor to drink fluids and tell him/her where to wait until ready to provide another specimen.  The donor will stay in sight of the DPC or collector.  When a second specimen is collected, the collector will note on the custody and control form the time that the insufficient specimen was discarded (e.g. insufficient specimen @ 1315) in the remarks section of the Chain of Custody Form (CCF).

6.  If the donor is not able to provide a specimen, the DPC or collector will instruct the donor to drink fluids and tell him/her where to wait until ready to provide a specimen.  It will be the responsibility of agency management to direct an employee to remain at the collection site for any additional time period.  

7. Immediately after collection, the collector shall, in the presence of the donor, measure the temperature of the specimen and conduct an inspection to determine the specimen's color and odor to identify signs of contaminants.  Any unusual findings resulting from the inspection shall be included on the custody and control form.  If the temperature of the specimen is outside the range of 32-38 C/90-100 F, this gives rise to reasonable suspicion of adulteration or substitution.  After consultation with and approval by the DPC, another specimen shall be collected under direct observation.  If the temperature of the specimen is outside the range and the collector is not the same gender, the DPC may select a same gender observer.  Both specimens must be forwarded to the laboratory for testing.  Any specimen suspected to be adulterated should always be forwarded for testing per HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.2, (f) (15).

8. Both the donor and the collector should keep the specimen in view at all times prior to it being sealed and labeled.  The collector shall direct the donor to initial and date the identification label on the specimen bottle.  If the donor does not follow these directions, the collector will write a memorandum for the record (MFR) stating that the donor was directed to write his/her initials on the label but declined to do so. This MFR will be enclosed with the CCF copy and sent to the laboratory.

9. Collection under direct observation shall never be made except with authorization from the DPC. Direct observation will be authorized only when the activity has reason to believe that the donor may or has altered or substituted the specimen.  The collector must be the same gender as the donor.  If the donor and collector are not the same gender, the DPC will select an observer of the same gender.

10. Split Specimen Collections - these procedures may only be used with prior approval of the USUHS DPC.  Split specimens will only be collected for random, follow-up, volunteer, reasonable suspicion or post-accident testing.  All HHS Guidelines will be followed when using split specimen procedures.

G. Identification and Recording of Urine Specimens

1. USUHS will be using the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF), OMB No. 0930-0158 or succeeding forms.  The identification labels on specimen bottles shall contain the date, the donor's initials, and a specimen ID number and a bar code (specimen ID number).  
The kit box/bag seal shall contain the collector's signature and date.

2. If the donor refuses to provide a social security number (SSN), the DPC shall provide the contractor with a number consisting of the activity UIC and a number identifying the individual.

3. The CCF copy will distributed as follows: Copy 1 will be sent with the specimen to the laboratory via overnight delivery; Copy 2 will be faxed to the MRO (legible copy) and the original will be sent by U.S. Mail to the MRO; Copy 3 will be retained by the collector; Copy 4 will be given to the DPC.  In cases where the collection was not done on the DPC's site, the copy will be sent by U.S. Mail to the DPC; and Copy 5 will be given to the donor at the time of the collection.

4. In the event that errors in the completion of the CCF are made by collection personnel and these errors can not be corrected by affidavit and results in the rejection of the specimen for testing by the laboratory, the contractor will be responsible for the cost of the rejected specimen(s).  USUHS will not be charged for these rejected specimen(s).  If errors made can be corrected by affidavit, the contractor will provide the affidavit correcting the error to the laboratory or MRO.

H. Transportation of Specimens

1. Specimens must be shipped overnight delivery to the laboratory at the conclusion of a drug testing event.  Should the time between collection and shipment exceed 24 hours, the USUHS DPC must be notified in writing of the circumstances.

3. Collection supplies to collectors for time sensitive collections (pre-employments, reasonable suspicion, and post-accident) may be sent by overnight delivery.

4. All transportation fees are paid by the contractor.

5. The contractor shall retain written evidence of shipping.  Written evidence may consist of a certified mail receipt, registered mail receipt, bill of lading, overnight air bill, etc.  The number of specimens per shipment shall be noted.  The contractor must maintain a copy for tracking purposes.

6. The contractor is responsible for placing traces on lost shipments and will report all such cases as well as the results of the contractor's inquiry to the DPC.

7. The risk of loss or damage to specimens that occurs while in shipment or that were improperly prepared by the collector (e.g. no accompanying custody and control form) shall remain with the contractor.  At the DPC?s direction, the contractor shall recollect all specimens not received, damaged, or improperly prepared for testing by the laboratory at no cost to the Government.  In addition, as liquidated damages, the contractor will pay the cost equal to the number of specimens lost, damaged, or improperly prepared for the type of tests collected.

8. The Custody and Control Form copies shall be distributed in accordance with the HHS Guidelines.

I. Supplies

1. The contractor shall provide all necessary supplies for the collection of the urine specimens to include, but not limited to: catch containers (individually wrapped); specimen bottles with temperature strip; bluing agent; tape; pens; thermometer; gloves; plastic pouch with absorbent pad; mailing boxes; Federal Custody & Control Forms (OMB #0930-0158); collection kits.

2. The custody and control forms (OMB #0930-0158) provided by the contractor must be bar coded (specimen ID number) on the form and the seals.  The identification number must be unique.  Any changes to the basic CCF as provided by the regulations must be approved by the USUHS DPC in advance.

J. Quality Control/Blind Sample Specimens

1. The contractor shall provide and submit quality control/blind samples to the laboratory at the minimum rate of 3% of the total number of specimens submitted per quarter as specified in HHS Guidelines, Subpart B, Section 2.5, (k).   

2. The contractor must develop and carry out a procedure for packaging the blind samples and distributing them from the designated testing location to the laboratory.  This shall be done in a manner such that the laboratory will not be able to identify the origination of the samples as control samples.  The procedures for processing and submitting blind samples will be in accordance with HHS Guidelines.

K. Specimen Security and Record Keeping

1. In order to assure that each urine specimen is properly identified and not accidentally confused with any other specimen, strict chain of custody procedures shall always be used by the collector when collecting and transferring the sample.  While performing any part of the chain of custody procedures, the contractor shall assure the urine specimen and custody documents are always under the total control of the collector.  If the collector must leave his/her workstation, the specimens and custody forms shall be taken with him/her or must be secured.  Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling the specimens in order to maximize the overall security of the specimens.

2. The Federal Custody and Control Form (CCF), shall be utilized for the purpose of maintaining control and accountability from initial collection to final disposition of all specimens.  The form will adhere to HHS specifications.  The form will identify the specimen through use of information, which matches label items, a unique number assigned to each urine specimen obtained, and bar coding.

3. The contractor shall establish and maintain the records required in a secure filing system. The records shall be maintained for a minimum of five (5) years.  The contractor will notify USUHS of any actual or attempted breach of security either with the hard copy or electronic files.

M. Quality Assurance Plan

1. The contractor shall maintain an internal quality assurance program which encompasses all aspects of the collection and transportation of urine specimens including: site/collection scheduling; collection procedures; chain of custody; security; overall professional and appropriate conduct; and procedures for resolving problems.  The contractor shall provide USUHS with the contractor's 
Quality Assurance Plan within two (2) months of the effective date of the contract.  USUHS has final approval of the Quality Assurance Plan.

2. The contractor is responsible for updating the Quality Assurance Plan with any procedural changes that may occur.

N. Testimony

1. The contractor shall make personnel and documentation available, whenever requested in writing by the USUHS DPC or appropriate agency official.

These clauses may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Additional required clauses other than those above may be included as Addenda on the award document.  
The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-6339-3021.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EST on February 20, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.

Testing can be scheduled after com line has been installed.  This will need to be coordinated between the contractor and the government.

8. Is a site visit required?  A ? This is up to the discretion of the contractor.

Contractor No. 3:
1. Unable to locate these items with RS232C control capability.  Do you have model numbers to reference?  A ? SOW has been revised to delete reference to RS-232; the only requirement is that the DVD-R can be operated by the control system.

2. Identify all sources for input to Video Scaler.  A ? SOW has been revised to remove requirement for Scaler and to identify all sources for inputs.

3. If we are to furnish and install a new rear project screen, who will remove the old one and rebuild the wall for the new screen.  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

4 a. Requested VSX 5000 will not allow multi point access.
   b. Will unit be rolled in front of projection screen when in use?
   c. What are the displays to be used for Videoconferencing?
   A ? (a) SOW has been revised to remove requirement for VSX 5000.  Choice of make and model is up to the contractor.  (b) SOW has been revised to state that system can be either set-top or semi-permanently mounted.  (c)  We do not understand the question.


5. a. Identify all functions of Control System.
    b. Will existing lectern be used?  If so will the top be modified to accommodate 	   	     new touch panel?
    c. Restate Touch panel sizes and locations

4. Is plenum wire required?  A ? No, unless it is required for the new system.	


Contractor No. 4:
1.	Government Responsibility did not mention the Mitsubishi XL5900LU Projector they are presently using. Are they going to use that projector to project on the rear projection screen? If the answer is yes are you going to buy a new lens for it? Or are you going to buy a mirror assembly to project on. The Projector in question will only project a 5?6? wide image on the projector screen from 10?6? throw distance.  A ? SOW has been revised to state that the Mitsubishi projector will be used/integrated with the new system.  Current screen size has been sufficient to date, there is no current need to increase screen size, but the government is open to contractor recommendations. 

2.	There was no mention for the ability to do teleconferencing from the room I looked at. Are they wanting to teleconference from this room? If so it would be easier to set this up at the same time we are updating the room. I could use the same microphones for both audio conferencing and videoconferencing if we do them at the same time.  A ? The current need does not require the ability to teleconference from this room.

3.	In 3.a. the switch does not apply since the screen is a rear projector screen is stationary and is made of a ridged material.  A ? This is a statement, not a question, no answer required.

4.	They are asking for an Integrated Power Amp with a Ceiling Microphone array and 4 ceiling speakers. What type of microphone array are they asking for. I have used some ceiling boundry microphones that work well in this type of application. I believe they would work better. They already have 8 ceiling tile speakers in the room. Are you planning on replacing these with the 4 speakers mentioned or are they adding 4 additional speakers?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.


Contractor No. 5:
1.	Who is responsible for taking non-operational equipment from existing rack to make room for new?  Vendor or DDOO?  A ? The government will be responsible for this.

2.	Is existing projector being used or should new be quoted?  A ? SOW has been revised to state that the Mitsubishi projector will be used/integrated with the new system.

3.	Switch/Scaler: what are inputs in addition to DVD/VHS Dual Deck?  A ? SOW has been revised to remove requirement for Scaler and to identify all sources for inputs.

4.	Screen: Synopsis requests installation of new screen.  There is existing framed glass screen.  Should vendor quote new and customer responsible for remodel of wall or utilize existing?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

5.	Video Conferencing: synopsis states multi-point capabilities.  Is DDOO host or receiving?  If host, state number of conferees required at one time (this determines codec model required).  A ? DDOO is receiving.

6.	Synopsis states VTC to be installed in adjoining room with remote access on table in conference room.  This suggests codec in adjoining room, camera(s) in conference room.  Is this correct?  If no, please explain.  A ? SOW has been revised to address this; otherwise this would depend on what equipment the contractor recommends.

7.	VTC Camera(s): should be located in conference room for viewing of far-end recipients of conference room attendees.  Should vendor quote single or multiple cameras?  If single VTC Camera, focus should be on lectern or conference table?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

8.	Ceiling Mic array: what areas in conference room should be considered ? lectern, conference table, rear room seating?  A ? SOW has been revised to state that microphones must provide sufficient coverage for the entire conference room.
