<DESC>CONUS C-130B-H/L-100/L-382 Aircrew &amp; Maintenance Simulator Training
<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA), 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS)/PKB, JBSA-Randolph TX intends to negotiate a sole source non-commercial, 5 year (CY18-CY 22) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with CAE USA, address: 4908 Tampa West Blvd Tampa FL, 33634; the only provider able to provide simulators with six degrees of freedom (Yaw, Pitch, Heave, Thrust, Roll and Sway) that are not Department of Defense or Foreign owned. This proposed contract action is pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Pursuant to FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p><br />The proposed procurement is for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement to provide Continental United States (CONUS) C-130/L-100/L-382 Aircrew &amp; Maintenance Simulator Training in support of multiple foreign countries. (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive.)</p>
<p>Services to be performed are CONUS training services at Contractor-provided training locations, consisting of commercial off the shelf (COTS) classroom and hands-on training to provide the necessary skills to independently operate and maintain C-130B-H and commercial variant (L-100/L-382) systems, subsystems, and related support equipment. Training shall provide students a thorough understanding of their specialty requirement so they can perform all tasks identified in applicable technical data with minimal supervision. Aircrew training objectives are to train aircrew members transitioning to the C-130B-H and commercial variant (L-100/L-382) aircraft, provide initial/refresher/upgrade training to experienced aircrews, and to provide initial training to cadets. Maintenance training objectives are to train technicians transitioning to the C-130B-H and commercial variant (L-100/L-382) aircraft, provide initial/refresher training to maintenance personnel qualified in system sub-specialties. This includes ground school, flight simulator instruction and teaching students the capabilities to instruct others in this ground school and flight simulator. Contractor must have the capability to support multiple training requirements simultaneously.</p>
<p>Academic training may consist of lecture/discussion sessions and laboratory exercises. Testing procedures must be in place and documentation will be required to verify the student has gained knowledge and skills taught. Structured On-The-Job Training (SOJT) shall be conducted in the appropriate laboratory, shop or flight line environment and shall include demonstration and application of academic studies.</p>
<p>The contractor's unique qualification or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited for the following reasons:</p>
<p>All other C-130 training is provided on simulators owned by the Department of Defense and operated by Lockheed Martin for the US Air Force and Marine Corp active duty training and research. These simulators are not available to support International Military Students (IMS).</p>
<p>All remaining simulators, which would fulfill this requirement, are owned by foreign countries and would not meet or be suitable for FMS customers.</p>
<p>The simulators owned and operated by CAE are the only level "D" simulators available in the United States that are available to support this requirement.</p>
<p>CAE has developed the training courses, manuals, handouts and cockpit mock-up panels that are individually tailored for Foreign Military Sales customers. Another contractor would incur significant costs to redevelop courses and training materials and would not be able to provide simulator capability necessary for this training effort.</p>
<p>Contact with Government personnel, other than those specified in this RFI, by potential offerors or their employees' regarding this requirement is not permitted. This is not a RFP. It is not to be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and will be provided at no cost to the Government. For purposes of this RFI, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611512 (Flight training Schools), with a size standard of $27.5M<br />Current System for Award Management (SAM) registration is mandatory (www.sam.gov).</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) National Wildlife Research Center intends to issue a Request for Proposal for development and supply of a placebo gummy containing rhodamine B.<br /><br />The gummy-type insert is required to deliver a biomarker (rhodamine B) using an existing bait delivery system. (See&nbsp;photographs attached.)&nbsp;The gummy must not be too sticky. Marshmellow cream has been used previously. The Government found that the thermal expansion and contraction of marshmallow with daily temperature fluctuations resulted in marshmallow leaking from around the wax seals, binding the bait within the pipe magazine. The gummy must fit into the existing fishmeal polymeric bait block and preferably have the capacity to be sealed within the bait block with paraffin wax. Gummy must be highly palatable so that a raccoon that began consuming the fishmeal block would likely continue consuming the gummy center carrying the rhodamine B biomarker. The dimensions are 15 g, 33 mm &times; 32 mm &times; 21 mm. The Government will provide the fishmeal blocks that the gummy must fit into. The bait must contain 150 mg of rhodamine B. The assembled baits must work in an existing bait delivery tube used for ORV raccoon control. Verification of the suitability of the bait for the delivery tube will be made by NWRC before the final baits are accepted. A minimum of 50 test baits are required for preliminary evaluation within 30 days following contract award. Test baits will be evaluated by the Government within two business days of receipt of the test baits. If the preliminary baits meet all requirements, a total of 2,500 baits are required within 60 days following contract award.<br /><br />This procurement is unrestricted. The appropriate NAICS code for this requirement is 325412 with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government contemplates award of a noncommercial firm-fixed-price contract.<br /><br />The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities website on or around February 24.

The Vendor shall be required to ensure performance occurs on a regular basis as outlined.  

NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD:  The NAICS code for this project is 562111 with a small business size standard of $38.5 million.
COMPETITION:  Solicitation R17PS00427is anticipated to be conducted as unrestricted competition.  The Government reserves the right to award with or without discussions. The project specifications will be defined in the solicitation document.  It is anticipated that any award made from the anticipated solicitation would be a base plus 4 year option award.

Interested parties are encouraged to monitor this announcement for updates and the release of the solicitation documents and should register at www.FedConnect.net to receive information and updates as well.

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to support DLA's Strategic Sourcing and Captains of Industry (COI) initiatives. This RFP is for a long-term strategic / sole source contract, which will include multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems / operational platforms. A total of 7 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that 7 will be priced for the contract award. OEM Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) is the approved source of supply for these items; therefore, the proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to the OEM.
<p><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLA Procurement Note 04, Government Surplus Property Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply long-term requirements. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Monday, February 27, 2017. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 7 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Tuesday, February 28, 2017. The anticipated closing date is Thursday, March 30, 2017.</p>

<RESPDATE>022417
<CONTACT>Theresa Boutchyard, Phone 4438614532, Email theresa.boutchyard@dla.mil
<DESC>The intent of this Synopsis, in accordance with FAR 5.201,&nbsp;is to add Air Defense Interrogators (ADI) variants: (AN/TPX-57(V)1, AN/TPX-57(V)2, AN/TPX-58(V)1, AN/TPX-59, and MANPAD) and associated spare parts, sustainment services, engineering support services, technical repair support, training, and technical manuals onto the already established contract with Raytheon Company, SPRBL1-15-D-0017. Our market research suggests that Raytheon is the sole approved source capable of providing these parts and services. The ADI is an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system used to make the initial classification of all targets and to perform re-classification of targets when their identities must be reconfirmed as a result of positional changes or flight path cross-overs.
<p>SPRBL1-15-D-0017 is a nine (9) year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract providing for the support of Depot Level Repairable (DLR) and consumable spare parts as well as repair and engineering services provided by Raytheon that are associated with sole-source Raytheon manufactured system components. The contract was awarded on 28 September 2015. The period of performance includes a six (6) year base period followed by one (1), three (3) year re-determinable option period. The contract maximum ceiling is $495.6M. The ADI parts will be priced for the remainder of the base period and may be priced via redetermination for the option period, if it is deemed to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>This synopsis details the intent of the Government to release a sole-source solicitation for these NSNs to Raytheon Company (CAGE Code 06845). Only the source previously approved by the government for supply of these items will be solicited. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Raytheon is the original developer and the only known source that produces the AN/TPX-57(V)1 &amp; 2 ADI, which are Non-Developmental Items (NDI), and possesses the level III technical data package for the ADI. The Government does not possess level III technical data package (TDP) for the ADI.</p>
<p>The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, please review the following steps that identify the technical data needed to demonstrate that a prospective contractor can competently manufacture an NSN to the same level of quality or better than the Approved Source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For an Alternate Product Please Submit in Accordance with the Following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;An Alternate Offeror shall respond to the Contracting Officer, Jacquelyn Dunne: <a href="mailto:Jacquelyn.dunne@dla.mil"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: windowtext; text-underline: none">Jacquelyn.dunne@dla.mil</span></a>, 443-861-4533 on whether they intend to offer the Government an alternative product and submit support documentation.</p>
<p>The review process for alternate offerors can take over 180 days from the date the alternate offeror package is received. Once a decision is made, you will receive a notification advising you of the results.</p>
<p>Alternate products may include a previously reverse-engineered product or a previously-approved product; and shall furnish the data required. Any product offered must be either the product cited from the Item Description listing above or be physically, mechanically, electrically, and functionally interchangeable with the product cited:</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror must indicate that an alternate product is being offered if the Offeror is any one of the following:</p>
<p>(i) An Offeror who (A) manufactures the item for an approved source currently cited; and (B) does not have authorization from that approved source to manufacture the item, identify it as the approved source part number, and sell the item directly to the Government;<br />(ii) A dealer/distributor offering the product of a manufacturer that meets the description in subparagraph (i) above;<br />(iii) An Offeror of a previously reverse-engineered product that is not currently cited; or<br />(iv) Any other Offeror who does not meet the criteria in subparagraphs (b)(1), (d), or (e) of this provision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(2) If an alternate product is offered, the Offeror shall furnish legible copies of all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to clearly describe the characteristics and features of the alternate product being offered. Data submitted shall cover design, materials, performance, function, interchangeability, inspection and/or testing criteria, and other characteristics of the offered product. If the offered product is to be manufactured in accordance with data the Offeror has obtained from elsewhere within the Government, the Offeror shall either furnish the detailed data specified in this paragraph, or supply a description of the data package in its possession; i.e., basic data document and revision, the date the data was obtained and from whom (Government agency/activity). If the Offeror does not furnish the detailed data with its offer, the Contracting Officer will be unable to begin evaluation of the offered product until such time as the detailed data can be obtained from the Government agency/activity possessing the data. If the alternate product is a previously reverse engineered product, the Offeror shall provide: traceability documentation to establish that the offered item represents the item specified (i.e., invoice from an approved source or submission of samples having markings of an approved source); number of samples that were examined; the process/logic used; raw data (measurements, lab reports, test results) used to prepare drawings or specifications for the offered item; any additional evidence that indicates the reverse-engineered item will function properly in the end item; and any evidence that life cycle/reliability considerations have been analyzed.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, the Offeror may be required to furnish data describing the exact product cited. The data required from the Offeror depends on the level of technical data describing the exact product, if any, available to the Government. The possible levels of technical data the Government may have and the corresponding data submission requirements for Offerors are identified in subparagraphs (a)-(d) below. For the item(s) being acquired under this solicitation, the level of data in the Governments possession and the corresponding requirements for data submission are identified; or, if not specified, are as follows: [buyer insert (a), (b), (c), or (d), as applicable]. (If the level of data in the Governments possession and Offeror requirements for data submission are not identified in either the POT or PID or in this subparagraph (c)(3), then subparagraph (i) below applies.)</p>
<p>(i) No data: This Agency has no data available for evaluating the acceptability of alternate products offered. In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish drawings and other data covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited, sufficient to establish that the Offeror's product is equal to the product cited.</p>
<p>(ii) Adequate proprietary (i.e., limited rights) data: This Agency possesses adequate drawings and/or specifications for the exact product as cited, but such data are proprietary (i.e., limited rights) and shall be used only for evaluation purposes. The Offeror must furnish the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, but is not required to submit data on the exact product.</p>
<p>(iii) Inadequate data: This Agency does not have adequate data available for evaluating the acceptability of alternate products offered. In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish drawings and other data covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited, sufficient to establish that the Offeror's product is equal to the product cited.</p>
<p>(iv) Adequate catalog data: This is a commercial off the shelf item. Adequate catalog data are available at the contracting office to evaluate alternate offers. In addition to the data required in subparagraph (c)(2) of this provision, the Offeror must furnish with its offer a commercially-acceptable cross reference list; or legible copies of all drawings, specifications or other data necessary to clearly describe the characteristics and features of the alternate product being offered, sufficient to establish that the Offerors product is equal to the product cited. The Offeror is not required to submit data on the exact product.</p>
<p>(4) The Contracting Officer will not evaluate offers of alternate product (which includes offers of previously reverse-engineered product) for the current procurement. Instead, the Offeror shall submit a request to the appropriate location for evaluation of the alternate products technical acceptability for future procurements of the same item. The request for evaluation shall cite the national stock number (NSN) of the exact product and, as identified in this synopsis, include the applicable level of technical data on the alternate and exact products. The level of technical data that the Government has available for use to evaluate the acceptability of an alternate product offered, and the corresponding level of technical data that must be furnished with an offer of alternate product, will be identified either or in paragraph (c)(2) of the provision at 52.217-9002. If the level of data and submission requirements are not identified in either of these locations in the solicitation, then 52.217-9002(c)(3)(i) applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be considered for the existing requirement, approved sources responding to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of synopsis. Please note, if evaluation of an approved alternate offeror cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirement preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirement, award of the subject requirement will proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Note: This notice is not a Request for Proposal. This notice is provided for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.</p>

<DESC>Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Design-Build (D-B) solicitation of the Rehabilitation of Arlington Memorial Bridge and Bascule Span Shoring, Project No. GWMP 11(4),11(7), located at District of Columbia (Washington, DC), as Solicitation Number: DTFH71-17-R-00006. The Arlington Memorial Bridge is a historic structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its significant architectural and engineering design as well as its symbolism and place within the monumental setting of Washington, DC. The bridge, opened to traffic in 1932, was constructed as a memorial to American patriotism and those who have died in military service to the country, as well as a symbolic representation of the reconciliation between the Union and Confederacy following the Civil War by connecting the Lincoln Memorial with Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial. The bridge was designed by the famed architectural firm, McKim, Mead &amp; White, and the innovative bascule span was developed by the Strauss Engineering Corporation to fit a working draw span into the monumental design. The bascule span was last opened more than 50 years ago. The mechanical equipment and original electrical system is not operational. Modern electrical lines have been installed and are operational. It is not anticipated to reopen the bascule span in the future.
<p>The Arlington Memorial Bridge (Structure No. 3300-016P) is 2,162 feet long and 94 feet wide. The bridge consists of ten reinforced concrete arch approach spans and a double leaf bascule span at the bridge's center. Eight of the 10 approach spans convey the Potomac River under the bridge. Two smaller concrete arches span the George Washington Memorial Parkway (GWMP) and Ohio Drive SW, at each end of the bridge. The bridge has sidewalks on each side measuring 13'-9" each, and the roadway measures 60 feet from curb to curb, providing six 10-foot-wide vehicle travel lanes.</p>
<p>The double-leaf bascule span consists of riveted steel trusses, supported on riveted steel trunnion posts with the counterweights below the deck. The bascule trusses support a floorbeam/stringer floor system and concrete filled grid deck. The main trunnions are spaced 216' on center (refer to the record contract plans for more details).</p>
<p>There are four cast-in-place deck arch spans, on each side, leading up to the bascule span. These spans range in length from 166'-0" to 180'-0" from springline to springline. At the east end, the structure crosses Ohio Drive and at the west end crosses the northbound lanes of GWMP. Each of these spans is constructed as a deck arch with a 50'-0" span length from springline to springline followed by the concrete approach frames. The exterior of the longitudinal walls, abutments, and piers are clad with granite ashlar. This project at this time is "Subject to the Availability of Funding". The design and construction cost for this base project plus options is estimated to be more than $100,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 104-106 (41 U.S.C. 253m), the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration is conducting a "two phased" Design-Build (D-B) selection process for the National Park Service.

<SOLNBR>AG-0343-S-17-0017
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Project Description: This project is being performed on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests in collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribe Watershed program. Newsome Creek Reach 2 has been diverted out of its historic channel as a result of past mining operations, negatively impacting the existing floodplain and riparian environment. The purpose of this project is to improve channel morphology and stream function utilizing as much of the restored valley bottom and floodplain as feasible and to increase fish habitat primarily through the use of stream habitat features (pools, riffles, glides, etc.) and large woody debris.
<p>In general, the project consists of the following components: access management; earthwork operations for construction of channel diversion structures, constructed channel segments, off-channel habitat, and floodplain swales; sod harvest, replant, and storage; construction of habitat structures; addition of floodplain roughness, logs, and slash; and coordination with the Forest Service Contracting Officer (Government) or their representative for dewatering and fish salvage, re-vegetation, and adherence to various site controls.</p>
<p>Specifically, this project requires construction activities to improve habitat on 1.1 miles of channel. Approximately 4310 feet of the previously straightened channel shall be rebuilt. Contractor shall construct 3 channel diversion structures, add off-channel habitat, install 16 key wood structures and a connecting system of wood, protect stream banks through the construction of 850 linear feet of brush fascines and add roughness (logs and brush) to 7.8 acres of floodplain. Contractor shall perform this work and all other incidental items necessary to complete the project in accordance with the plans and specifications. In-stream equipment operation window: July 15 - Sept 30. Project completion deadline: October 30, 2017.</p>
<p>This project is located on Newsome Creek in Idaho County, Idaho upstream of the Newsome Town Site, approximately 10 miles northwest of Elk City, Idaho. Access to the site is from Idaho State Highway 14 to Newsome Creek Road 1858 which passes through Newsome Townsite. Beyond Newsome Townsite, past MP 7 of Road 1858, a 0.9-mile long, gated, primitive access route takes of sharply uphill and to the right providing access to the project. Motorized access is prohibited. The project site is located approximately 0.9 miles from the gate.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the solicitation package will be available in March and should be downloaded from this website at that time. No formal pre-bid tour is planned; however, site photos have been provided and detailed drawings and specifications will be included with the solicitation. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. <br /><br />The estimated price range for the project is $250,000-$500,000. Bid&nbsp;guarantees are required; 20% of the offer value. This procurement is being set-aside 100% for small business. Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, supplies (other than those listed as Government-furnished items) and supervision necessary to complete the work according to the contract.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters has released a solicitation, titled Early Career Faculty (ECF), as an appendix to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2017 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2017), on February 9, 2017. The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ , selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Early Career Faculty (ECF)." <br />STMD, and the Space Technology Research Grants (STRG) Program in particular, seek proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of faculty members early in their careers as they conduct space technology research of high priority to NASA's Mission Directorates and STMD. NASA is seeking proposals that plan to pursue innovative, early-stage space technology research in the topic areas specifically enumerated in the solicitation.<br /> <br />Our Nation's universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly-found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industrial, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. academic institutions promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country's scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. These investments also create, fortify, and nurture the talent base of highly skilled engineers, scientists, and technologists to improve America's technological and economic competitiveness.<br /><br />The following topics are anticipated for the final appendix: Integrated Photonic Sensors and Science Instrument Subsystems; Meso- and Micro-scale Fluidic Sample Acquisition and Handling for Human Exploration and Space Science Missions; Cognitive Communications for NASA Science and Exploration; and Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Solutions for NASA Data Challenges.<br /><br />Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The proposed research must be led by a single, eligible Principal Investigator (PI). The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency. The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort; Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators (other than NASA civil servants/JPL) are permitted. See the solicitation for complete requirements regarding eligibility and for definitions and restrictions regarding collaborators.<br /> <br />A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this appendix.<br /><br />NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all U.S. universities and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities to apply.<br /> <br />The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in October 2017. NASA plans to make approximately 6-8 awards as a result of this ECF solicitation, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals. The actual number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received; NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this solicitation.<br /> <br />All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent are strongly encouraged by March 3, 2017. Proposals are due on or before March 31, 2017. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the solicitation. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline.<br /> <br />Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Procurement questions may be addressed by e-mail to the acquisition point of contact on this solicitation, Kimberly Cone, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) documents located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved. <br />

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Global Data Publications Inc., 441 Lexington Ave, New York, NY, 10017-3910 to provide a one-year base subscription to the Pharma eTrack Database to NHLBI's Office of Technology Transfer and Development (OTTAD) in accordance with the following information:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>OTTAD's primary mission is to enable researchers within the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research to interact more effectively with their counterparts in the private sector and in academia to establish collaborative relationships that further develop existing technologies, facilitate the sharing of technologies with outside laboratories, and create innovative technologies in collaboration with others, with the ultimate goal of benefitting the public health in a variety of basic, translational, and clinical areas, including imaging, diagnostics, regenerative medicine, genetics/genomics, developmental biology, cellular and gene therapy, and cell and molecular biology relating to heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders and diseases. To this end, OTTAD negotiates Cooperative Research Development Agreements (CRADA), Research Collaboration Agreements (RCA), Clinical Trial Agreements (CTA), Material Transfer Agreements (MTA), Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDA), and other Technology Transfer transactional agreements on behalf of NHLBI that facilitate collaboration while protecting NHLBI's intellectual property interests.</p>
<p>OTTAD also acts as the contact point within NHLBI for all new inventions made by NHLBI intramural researchers. The office advises the Scientific Director, intramural investigators and NHLBI leadership on issues relating to patenting and intellectual property. In addition, OTTAD manages NHLBI's large and diverse portfolio of technologies that are available for commercial licensing.</p>
<p>OTTAD works closely with its Clients to meet their technology transfer and intellectual property needs. OTTAD's Clients are the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), including the NIH Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation (NIH CHI) and the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH CRM).</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a one-year base subscription to GlobalData's Pharma eTrack Database. GlobalData provides research solutions covering the full breadth of the pharmaceuticals industry, from clinical trials and epidemiology intelligence, to focused modules available across multiple therapy areas. Each component of their research creates comprehensive, tailor-made research solutions for healthcare professionals. The unique databases, quality expert analysis and powerful workflow tools are available on an online subscription platform to provide decision-making support around the clock.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance is 2/17/2017 - 2/16/2018</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research. Per the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the services are available from only one source. Additionally, this is a follow-on to an existing contract (HHSN268201500436PC) and Global Data Publications is currently providing these services to the NHLBI. If another contractor were to take over, there would not only be a lapse in services, but there would be an expensive and duplicative investment in analysis, training, and implementation. This loss of productivity and substantial duplication of costs is unacceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<p>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Medicine in the Americas Cataloging Project<br />Statement of Work<br />RFQ-NLM-HMD</p>
<p><br />I. Background</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) owns over 40,000 monographs printed prior to 1923 in the Americas (Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America, Mexico, and the United States). In 2009 NLM began scanning these items as part of a mass digital project, called Medicine in the Americas. Over 15,000 volumes dated before 1900 have already been scanned and uploaded to NLM's Digital Collections repository (https://collections.nlm.nih.gov) and the Internet Archive (archive.org).</p>
<p>In 2007, NLM conducted a pilot project which revealed that the availability of consistent metadata prior to scanning promotes efficiency during the digitization workflow. According to a random survey of Americana titles conducted in 2008, almost 80% of these monographs have cataloging records that lack Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. Many of these records were created prior to the implementation of national cataloging standards, such as the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (2nd edition, revised) (AACR2r) or Resource, Description, and Access (RDA). Thousands of records must be upgraded to meet the national standards for full-level cataloging and ensure the consistency that is required for optimal metadata transfer into NLM's digital repository.</p>
<p>Additionally, some Medicine in the Americas titles do not have distinct cataloging records in NLM's online catalogue, LocatorPlus. Decades ago, NLM used a single record approach for cataloging titles that appeared in multiple editions. Although many of these "multiple-edition records" have been re-cataloged over the years to meet the current standard of one record per edition, there are still several hundred editions that need separate records. These titles need full-level records created for them, either by using available OCLC copy or by creating an original record using Exlibris' Voyager software.</p>
<p>There are also an unknown number of monographs that may be bound with other titles, but do not have individual cataloging records. Many Medicine in the Americas titles are part of NLM's Bound Pamphlet collection which has been sporadically cataloged over the years. When the Voyager system was implemented in 1998, cataloging records from the old system were migrated, but individual holdings and item records were mistakenly created for each title. To facilitate proper circulation of these materials the bibliographic records need to be linked to each other through the use of one holdings and item record.</p>
<p>Approximately 75% of the Medicine in the Americas titles are written in English, with about 15% in Spanish, and less than 10% in French or German. A very small percentage are written in a variety of other languages.</p>
<p><br />II. Purpose</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to obtain the on-site services of a professional cataloger to upgrade monographic cataloging records to full-level national standards, including assigning a full complement of MeSH. The cataloger shall also create separate bibliographic records for titles cataloged on multiple-edition records in Voyager. Bibliographic records shall also be created for all bound-together titles or editions without separate records in Voyager. The cataloger shall ensure that bound-together titles are properly linked in Voyager to facilitate the proper circulation of the physical volumes.</p>
<p>III. Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>The cataloger shall perform the following duties:<br />A. Confirm that there is only one bibliographic record for a title in the Voyager database and evaluate what type of cataloging work is necessary: none; record creation for uncataloged titles; single record upgrade; recataloging of multiple edition records; and/or holding and item record maintenance, including the linking of bound-together titles; <br />B. Identify whether single edition records have been cataloged according to current full-level national standards, including a full complement of MeSH terms;<br />C. Upgrade single edition records to current full-level national standards, as modified per NLM's local policies;<br />D. Create separate bibliographic records for uncataloged titles and editions cataloged on multiple-edition records, either by using available OCLC copy or by creating an original record directly in Voyager;<br />E. Confirm that all name headings used in the upgraded or created records have corresponding fully established authority records in Voyager; <br />F. Ensure that all bibliographic records have accurate holdings and item records, according to NLM's local policies, including proper linking of bound-together titles;<br />G. Provide Contracting Officer's Representative with proper documentation of upgraded and newly created bibliographic and authority records.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall upgrade or create records in accordance with the following standards: MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data (MARC21); the Anglo American Cataloging Rules (2nd ed., 2002 rev, 2005 update) (AACR2), the Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRI), Resource, Description, and Access (RDA), the Library of Congress-Program for Cooperative Cataloging Policy Statements (LC-PCC PS), and local NLM policy documentation. Holdings and item record data shall be verified and/or input according to the NLM Guidelines for Interpreting, Creating, and Maintaining Holdings Records and the NLM Guidelines for Interpreting, Creating and Maintaining Item Records.</p>
<p>All work shall be performed in accordance with accepted principles of the NLM's quality standards, MeSH and NLM policies and in adherence to MARC21.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform this work on-site in the History of Medicine Division at NLM, during standard business hours, 8:30-5:00, Monday-Friday. Adjustments to this schedule may be permitted at the discretion of the Contracting Officer's Representative.</p>
<p>All Contractor staff shall receive training at the NLM in the proper handling of NLM materials. The Contractor shall follow these procedures:</p>
<p>A. Prohibit eating or drinking (except bottled water) in areas where NLM materials are stored or work is performed. <br />B. Handle NLM materials with clean hands.<br />C. Use pencils (no pens) when working with NLM materials<br />D. Handle books gently, using supports and weights as necessary. Turn pages carefully to prevent the paper from breaking along the edges or inner margin. If folded items appear to be too brittle to unfold or turn pages, refer items to Contracting Officer's Representative.<br />E. Keep fragile items in envelopes or boxes when they are not required for processing or review.</p>
<p><br />IV. Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>A. Voyager record search and evaluation<br />i. The Contractor shall search each title in Voyager to confirm that only one bibliographic record exists in the database for it<br />1. If duplicate records are found, the Contractor shall make printouts of both records and ask the Contracting Officer's Representative for further instructions<br />2. If no Voyager record is found, the Contractor shall create a full level record for the title, either by importing OCLC copy or creating an original record directly in Voyager, per local NLM policies; see Section C, below for guidance in upgrading OCLC copy and determining what information to include in an original record<br />ii. If only one Voyager record is found, the Contractor shall bring the following types of records to the attention of the Contracting Officer's Representative<br />1. The 999 $a is not coded AUTH<br />2. The 060 is significantly different from what is on the piece<br />3. The record appears to be for a non-book format, such as a microfilm or electronic resource <br />4. Any other situations that make the Contractor question whether the bibliographic record matches the piece in hand<br />iii. The Contractor shall examine the bibliographic record for the piece in hand to determine if the record is for one specific edition or multiple editions. Multiple edition records generally have the following MARC data:<br />1. 008 Date type = m and Date2 = 9999<br />2. 250 $a = [1st]- ed.<br />3. 300 $a = v.<br />iv. The Contractor shall confirm that all titles in a bound-together item have individual bibliographic records in Voyager<br />v. The Contractor shall verify that all copies of a single edition, based on the holdings and item records, are in hand<br />vi. The Contractor shall verify that all editions cataloged on a multiple edition record, based on the holdings and item records, are in hand. If the holdings records indicate that other editions are in the stacks in the location GenColl, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative</p>
<p>B. Identification of full-level single edition records<br />i. The Contractor shall examine the Leader field of single edition records and confirm that the Encoding Level value is "_" for Full level and that the record is cataloging according to AACR2 (Leader Cataloging Form is "a") or RDA (Leader Cataloging From is "i" and 040 $e rda is present); if not, the record shall be upgraded<br />ii. The Contractor shall examine the 6XX fields and confirm that at least one MeSH term (field 650, second indicator 2) has been assigned to the record; if no MeSH term has been assigned to the record, the record shall be upgraded. Even if one MeSH term is present, if any 653 or 690 fields are also present, the record shall be upgraded. <br />iii. The Contractor shall edit the 9XX fields to NLM specifications after determining that a single edition record does not require upgrading</p>
<p>C. Upgrading of single edition records determined not to be full-level AACR2 or RDA standard<br />i. If the Leader Cataloging Form is "a" for AACR2, the Contractor shall upgrade the record to full level AACR2 standard; otherwise the Contractor shall upgrade the record to full level RDA standard<br />ii. The Contractor shall update the 008, 041, and 044 fields per NLM local specifications<br />iii. The Contractor shall verify that the 060 call number matches what is on the piece and upgrade the record as necessary; the Contractor shall leave "as is" any 060 beginning with the word Film; for bound-together titles, the Contractor shall append to the 060 the phrase "no. #", where the # symbol equals the position of the title in the volume (i.e, no.1 is the first title in the volume, no.2 is the second title in the volume)<br />iv. The Contractor shall verify that all data in the bibliographic description (fields 245, 250, 260, and 490) is transcribed according to the appropriate standard and upgrade the record as necessary<br />v. If the piece is a translation, the Contractor shall confirm that appropriate data is entered into the 041, 240, and 500 fields per the appropriate standard and upgrade the record as necessary<br />vi. The Contractor shall confirm that the physical description given in the 300 field is constructed according to the appropriate standard; that plates, illustrations, maps, and portraits included in the work are noted; that the height of the book in centimeters is given; and upgrade the record as necessary <br />vii. The Contractor shall confirm that any mandatory notes required by the appropriate standard for full level records are present in the record and upgrade the record as necessary<br />viii. Field 590 is no longer used by NLM. The Contractor shall refer any records containing a 590 field to the Contracting Officer's Representative for guidance and resolution<br />ix. If the piece in hand contains provenance information (for example: ownership inscription(s), presentation inscription(s), bookplate(s), etc.), the Contractor shall confirm that a basic description of the provenance is entered into local 541 and 561 fields according to local NLM specifications, and upgrade the record as necessary. The Contractor shall refer illegible and/or complex provenance to the Contracting Officer's Representative for guidance and resolution<br />x. The Contractor shall delete any 653 or 690 fields from the record and confirm that any existing MeSH terms are appropriate. As necessary, the Contractor shall assign up to 5 topical MeSH terms (including qualifiers), plus age groups, geographic headings and publication types to reflect both the primary and secondary aspects of the publication. The Contractor shall code the 65X fields per local NLM specifications. Subject headings for persons and corporate bodies shall also be confirmed or added as necessary.<br />xi. The Contractor shall confirm that the record contains access points (1XX/7XX/830) and relationship designators (when permitted by the cataloging standard) for all persons and corporate bodies with primary responsibility for the work (i.e., authors, editors, commentators, and translators) and series titles, and upgrade the record as necessary<br />xii. The Contractor shall also confirm that the record contains local name access points for persons or corporate bodies mentioned in provenance notes (541/561), when a Voyager authority record already exists for these names, and upgrade the record as necessary; the Contractor shall not create or import NAF authority records for names mentioned in provenance notes when there is not a pre-existing Voyager authority record<br />xiii. The Contractor shall edit the 9XX fields per local NLM specifications</p>
<p>D. Recataloging of multiple edition records<br />i. The Contractor shall mark the multiple edition record for deletion per local NLM policies.<br />ii. The Contractor shall search each edition in OCLC, looking for matching copy to import<br />iii. The Contractor shall edit the OCLC copy per NLM local policies<br />iv. If no OCLC copy is found for an edition, the Contractor shall create a bibliographic record for the edition in Voyager. When efficient, the Contractor shall use Voyager's "Make a Copy" feature to facilitate record creation<br />v. If the multiple edition record contains a 533 "Microfilm note", the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative of the Voyager Bib ID of the multiple edition record and the Voyager Bib IDs of the newly created records for each edition.</p>
<p>E. Name and series authority work<br />i. The Contractor shall ensure that all access points for persons, corporate bodies, and series titles used in the 1XX, 6XX, 7XX, and 830 fields have corresponding fully established authority records in Voyager, containing an 010 LCCN and 008 Subject Heading "c" for Medical Subject Headings. <br />1. Authority records coded AACR2, AACR2-compatible, or RDA may be used to support headings in bibliographic records coded AACR2.<br />2. Only authority records coded RDA or fully established AACR2, if the 1XX field would be constructed the same way under both AACR2 and RDA, may be used to support headings in bibliographic records coded RDA. Preliminary, provisional, AACR2-compatible or authority records with 667 notes stating "THIS 1XX FIELD CANNOT BE USED UNDER RDA UNTIL THIS RECORD HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND/OR UPDATED", must be upgraded to RDA. <br />3. Any authority records containing an 010 field, that need to be modified to comply with national standards, must be reported to the Contracting Officer's Representative. <br />ii. If a Voyager authority record is found, but it lacks an 010 field, the Contractor shall search the heading in the National Authority File (NAF) via OCLC<br />1. If an authority record is found in the NAF, the Contractor shall update the Voyager authority record to match that in the NAF, with the exception of coding the 008 Subject Heading value as "c" for Medical Subject Headings; code the 9XX fields to local NLM specifications; and upgrade the record the RDA if necessary.<br />2. If an authority record is not found in the NAF, the Contractor shall update the Voyager authority record to full RDA standard based on the piece in hand and name usage in OCLC bibliographic records; and code the 9XX fields to local NLM specifications.<br />iii. If a Voyager authority record is not found, the Contractor shall search the heading in the NAF via OCLC<br />1. If an authority record is found in the NAF, the Contractor shall import the record to Voyager; update the 008 Subject Heading value to "c" for Medical Subject Headings; code the 9XX fields to NLM local specifications; and upgrade the record to RDA if necessary.<br />2. If an authority record is not found in the NAF, the Contractor shall create one in Voyager to full RDA standard using the system's "Create Auth Record" feature and code the 9XX fields to NLM local specifications <br />iv. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative of all new authority records and any authority records that have been modified</p>
<p>F. Holding and Item Record Creation/Maintenance<br />i. The Contractor shall ensure that each distinct physical edition has a holdings record with an HMD location code and that each physical copy and volume has an item record, all formatted to local NLM specifications<br />ii. If the Contractor has maintained the 060 field in the bibliographic record, the Contractor shall update the call number in the holdings record as necessary<br />iii. If the Contractor encounters non-HMD holdings or item records attached to a bibliographic record, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer's Representative; under no circumstances is the Contractor to maintain non-HMD holdings or item records unless expressly directed to do so by the Contracting Officer's Representative<br />iv. When separate bibliographic records are created for editions formerly cataloged on multiple edition records, the Contractor shall create HMD holdings records for each newly created bibliographic record; the Contractor shall re-link the item records from the HMD holdings record attached to the original multi-edition record to the appropriate newly created HMD holding record for each edition<br />v. If the piece in hand is a bound-with, i.e., contains multiple titles bound together subsequent to publication, the Contractor shall ensure that the bibliographic records are properly linked together using only 1 holdings and item record<br />1. If the Contractor discovers that each distinctive title has an individual HMD holdings and/or item record, the Contractor shall delete the item and holding records for each title in the volume, except for the first; and link the remaining holdings/item record to the other titles in the volume<br />2. The Contractor shall ensure that the call number in the 852 field of the holdings record reflects the volume as a whole and not an individual title (i.e., the call number does not contain the phrase "no. #")<br />3. The Contractor shall maintain the Free Text field of the item record per local NLM specifications</p>
<p>G. Document Work Performed<br />i. The Contractor shall make printouts of each bibliographic record before work is performed<br />ii. The Contractor shall make printouts of each bibliographic record that has been upgraded or newly created<br />iii. The Contractor shall make printouts of each authority record before it is maintained<br />iv. The Contractor shall make printouts of each authority record that has been maintained, newly created, or imported from OCLC<br />v. Printouts shall be submitted to the Project as outlined below in Section VII Deliverables and Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>All data created and entered for this project must be in accordance with the Inspection and Acceptance Standards listed in Section IX. The Contractor shall bring any problems that arise to the attention of the Contracting Officer's Representative.</p>
<p><br />V. Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>NLM quality review of cataloging and authority records will be based on sampling of batches as delivered by the vendor each week. The sample size reviewed by NLM may vary from 20% to 100% of the records in any batch. During the first months of the period of performance of this purchase order, NLM anticipates a random sampling of greater than 20% of any work completed.</p>

<RESPDATE>020918
<ARCHDATE>02242018
<CONTACT>William J. Hepler 805 982-3872
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. This announcement is open for one year from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period. This announcement replaces N39430-16-R-7201

FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs to the acquisition of basic and applied research, and that portion of
advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.

Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.
 This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services.

This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Navy operations, and applies to Navy installations worldwide. NEXWC is interested in environmental technologies and methodologies that are either new, innovative, advance the state-of-the-art, or increase knowledge or understanding of a technology or methodology.

The technology or methodology shall address one of the following topic areas.

TOPIC NO. 1: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, RESTORATION AND CLEANUP. Services to assess and/or remediate existing pollution generated by military operations, including methodologies for evaluation of ecological risk, risk reduction, and/or establishing risk based cleanup goals.

TOPIC NO.
 2: CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. Practices that support habitat both on land and at sea for rare and endangered species, migratory birds or marine mammals, and that comply with environmental  legislation and ensure protection of sensitive resources while supporting military operations.

TOPIC NO 3: UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO). Services for explosive ordnance detection, location, de-energizing, disposal or remediation of UXO generated by military operations.

TOPIC NO 4: POLLUTION PREVENTION.
Process design changes, management practices or methodologies to minimize the amount of pollution generated during present or future operations and maintenance.

TOPIC NO 5: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.
 Process design changes or management practices that facilitate or enhance the Navys ability to comply with local, state, and federal environmental regulatory requirements.

TOPIC NO 6: SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. Facility systems, process changes, or management practices that allow the Navy to perform its mission while reducing the overall environmental and economic footprint (reduce land use, energy use, water use, chemical use, and waste generation) associated with facilities. Specific areas of interest include: water conservation, greenhouse gas reduction, energy conservation, and renewable energy generation.

Abstract submittals to this BAA can be made using the abstract form and instructions located at the following URL:
http://www.navfac.navy.mil/navfac_worldwide/specialty_centers/exwc/products_and_services/ev/ec/baa.html

Submission process: This announcement is for abstracts/white papers only.

Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses.
 Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance and merit. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications and prior government projects.

Abstracts will be thoroughly evaluated by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement.

Once the evaluation process has been completed, the abstracts that meet the basic criteria of the BAA are posted on a protected web site available for DoD use only.
 When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NEXWC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time regarding cost and pricing submittals, in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission.

Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts.

Government / Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) / University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) entities interested in responding should read NOTE 8 below.
 An average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years.

The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following. Factors (1), (2) and (3) are approximately equal, and when combined, are approximately equal to (4). Factors 1-4, when combined, are approximately equal to price:

1.The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, as well as Naval relevance.

2.The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract.

Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the proposal as such.

3.NEXWC requires the offeror to provide their Experience Modification Rate (EMR) and Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) ratings.
 Safety is an integral and important part of NEXWC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale. See NFAS 15.304.

4.The contractors capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. See NAVFAC Acquisition Requirement (NFAS) 15.304.

5.The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach.

NOTES:
1. An eligible abstract does not guarantee a contract. NEXWC reserves the right to select for award any, all, or none of the proposals received.
 NEXWC also reserves the right to select for award a portion of the work proposed in any single proposal.

2. An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at HTTPS://WWW.SAM.GOV.

3. The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the abstract.

4. There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA, other than the submission form. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA program must follow the instructions described herein to submit an abstract.

5.
 There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before a contract award.

6. As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects. Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207.

The cognizant Program Officer and other Government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals.
 Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractors employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of the NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award.
 Please review NFAS / FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4).

7. Responders are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Business proprietary or competition-sensitive information shall be marked as such. The offeror should expect to receive notification of receipt of the abstract by the Government within one week of submission. If the contractor does not receive a notification of abstract receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided.

8. Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Part 226.3.
All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals.
 No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities. Non-DOD Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply.

Naval laboratories and warfare centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit an abstract response to this BAA.
 As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.

9. Do not call the Contracting Office for verification, as the abstract is not received or reviewed by the Contracting Office.

The USG cannot provide certain types of data to support this effort; your company must be able to obtain this data.<br />5.&nbsp;Describe your company's ability to deliver the prescribed source data to the Government enabling the establishment and validation/verification of organic depot-level maintenance for the MEON Test Set.&nbsp; If your company will be required to subcontract work to complete this effort, specify whom you will contract with and what percentage of the effort the subcontractor will perform.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Describe your company's expertise and ability to identify existing and potential depot-level maintenance capabilities for the MEON Test Set, its components and subcomponents.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;Describe your company's expertise and ability to identify and convey provisioning data as relating to the MEON Test Set depot level maintenance.&nbsp; "Provisioning" is defined as the process of determining and acquiring the range and quantity of support items (e.g., spares, repair parts, bulk materiel, tools and test equipment) necessary to operate and maintain a system.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;Describe your company's expertise and ability to identify and deliver appropriate technical manuals and other documentation necessary to operate and maintain organic depot level maintenance operations for the MEON Test Set or test set components.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;Describe your company's expertise and ability to identify, optimize, and implement facility requirements and process flows as relating to the MEON Test Set depot-level maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The capabilities package shall be limited to twenty (20) double-spaced, minimum 10 point font, single-sided pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respondents who submit a capabilities package in response to this notice shall identify prior contracts (by contract number and issuing office) and commercial and Government points of contact (preferably the buyer or contracting officer) related to these efforts.</p>
<p>Respondents should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), HUBZone, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned or a woman owned small business.&nbsp; The general definition of a small business for this SSS is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing an Air Force contract, and one who's number of employees does not exceed 1000.&nbsp; The North American Industrial Classification System Code to be used for this SSS is 336412.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition.&nbsp; Request respondents indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled contractor and any contemplated use of Foreign national employees on this effort.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this SSS is voluntary. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the USG, nor will the USG reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capabilities statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.&nbsp; A key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.&nbsp; The clause reads, in part, as follows:&nbsp; "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) ... (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies).&nbsp; The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials."&nbsp; Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.&nbsp; Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>If this effort is not a set-aside for small business, a small business utilization requirement will be considered.&nbsp; Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable requirement for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.<br />&nbsp;<br />Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The USG appreciates that interested respondents may not be able to respond to this market research without disclosing information deemed "proprietary."&nbsp; Data submitted in response to this market research will be distributed and discussed within the Government Respondents are responsible for clearly marking submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings.&nbsp; Analyses of responses may require disclosure of responses to Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) support contractor personnel.&nbsp; All members of the Government/Contractor team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required and other applicable statutes or regulations.&nbsp; In addition, USG members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.&nbsp; All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.</p>
<p>This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.&nbsp; The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse respondent(s) for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Interested respondents should submit their responses to the contracting negotiator via mail to Ms. Julianne Indelicato, AFLCMC/WLYK, 2275 D Street, Bldg. 16, Room 0103, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7222, or electronically to julianne.indelicato@us.af.mil.&nbsp; Responses must be received no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this announcement.&nbsp; If necessary, the Government may elect to contact interested parties for further clarifications or site visits.</p>

<DESC>Interested vendors are encouraged to check this site often to view any updates and additions. The Government is interested in providing as much information as possible to interested vendors. If there is a particular document or specific information an interested vendor would like to see included in the Bidder's Library, please send that request to the Points of Contact identified herein.
<p>PLEASE NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SOLICITING PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. NO CONTRACT WILL RESULT FROM THIS POSTING.</p>
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION:<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the United States Government (USG) to form a binding contract. The USG is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources and subcontracting opportunities, firms that may possess the expertise, capabilities, experience and necessary data to competently and competitively respond to all requirements to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and Maintenance Training in support of the Light Air Support (LAS) A-29 aircraft and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Ground Training Devices (GTDs) for a Building a Partnership Capacity Program for the Afghanistan Air Force (AAF). The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this acquisition has not been determined.</p>
<p>1.1 BACKGROUND:<br />&bull; In order to provide a seamless continuation of operations, requirements must be met in their entirety and be in place in Afghanistan at bases to be specified (see section 5 for potential locations) as well as continued operations at Moody Air Force Base through at least CY 2019. The contractor must be able to support all contractual requirements at all locations by 01 Oct 18.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft, designated as the A-29 LAS aircraft, is a non-developmental aircraft procured from Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). SNC is presently subcontracting to Embraer, who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for their A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. The LAS aircraft mission includes conducting advanced flight training, surveillance, air interdiction, and close air ground support.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft is a single-engine, turboprop, fixed-wing aircraft, with tricycle style, retractable landing gear, tandem two-place pressurized cockpit with ejection seats, capable of operating from semi-prepared air fields and employing various munitions from North Atlantic Treaty Organization compatible hard points. <br />&bull; SNC has supported LAS aircraft production and all maintenance/supply requirements for the aircraft, GTDs, and associated support equipment for LAS operations (except for munition build up, munitions delivery and pilot aircrew flight equipment). <br />&bull; This is anticipated to be a Performance Based Services Contract with a Period of Performance (PoP) not to exceed five (5) years.<br />&bull; The contract contemplates transferring aircraft maintenance and some supply functions to the AAF with a corresponding drawdown of contractor support, in which the scope and timeline have yet to be defined. Currently, there are no plans to transition GTD CLS maintenance support to the AAF. <br />&bull; Because Afghanistan is a variable environment, there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period with little or no notice. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location.</p>
<p>1.2 REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide a qualified workforce, all spares, support equipment and consumables to perform aircraft ICS, GTD CLS, and training at a minimum of one main operating base and aircraft ICS and training at possibly three enduring (continually operational) forward operating locations in Afghanistan. Additionally, the contractor may be responsible for continued operations at Moody AFB, GA through at least CY 2019. The contractor should account for associated movement of resources (e.g., aircraft, GTDs) from Moody AFB to Afghanistan; the transitional timeline has yet to be determined. Proposed contract effort includes: <br /><br />1) Aircraft Maintenance<br />a) Launch and recovery<br />b) Aircraft Munition Loading<br />c)&nbsp;Maintain a Fully Mission Capable (FMC) rate of 80% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />d)&nbsp;Maintain a Maintenance Cancellation Rate of less than (&lt;) 5% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />e) Future metrics are in development and expect to include tracking of partially mission capable (PMC) and training<br />f) Procurement, removal and installation of Cartridge Activated Device/Propellant Activated Device (CAD/PAD) components for the ejection seat/canopy as well as all other life support components installed in the ejection seat. (Pilot aircrew life equipment (AFE) will not be the responsibility of the contractor.<br />g) The Contractor shall support a CONUS maintenance window of 12-hours per day, 6 days a week and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight. The Contractor shall support an OCONUS maintenance window of 18-hours per day, 7 days a week. This 12- or 18-hour period may begin at different times of day depending on the operations schedule. OCONUS missions may occasionally be required outside this 18-hour per day, 7 day per week maintenance window and require ability to surge to 24 hours per day at the OCONUS MOB and each OCONUS FOL. The total fleet (of 20 aircraft) Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO) is 14,400 hours annually, calculated as 60 hours per month, multiplied by the number of aircraft, and multiplied by 12 months. <br />h) At this time, DFARS 252.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk, is not anticipated to be incorporated in any subsequent contract.<br />2) GTD operation and maintenance. <br />a) Training <br />b) Maintain a Mission Effectiveness (ME) rate of 95% or higher for each GTD <br />c) GTD availability shall be planned based on 8 hours per day, 6 days per week, with the ability to surge to 12 hours per day, if required.<br />3) Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations<br />4) Transition of aircraft maintenance and some supply functions (e.g., ordering, stocking) to the AAF and sustain associated transition metrics, which have yet to be determined. <br />5) Packing, handling, shipping and transportation<br />6) Special tools and test equipment including calibration<br />7) Responsible for repair and overhaul plan of all repairable spares<br />8) Classroom academics and Structured On-the-job training (SOJT) to fully qualify trainees as A 29 maintainers and track associated metrics. The contractor will also be required to provide A-29 familiarization training to USG Air Advisors. <br />9) Maintaining and updating technical manuals and data <br />10) Program management and site management <br />11) Engineering services including airworthiness, technical support, and aircraft modifications<br />12) Field team support<br />13) Operational Flight Program (updates) and other required software and database updates to support operational requirements<br />14) Contract quality administration <br />15) Contract Deliverables Requirements List (CDRLs)<br />16) Movement of spares, ground support equipment, associated tooling, GTD, and ferry of remaining aircraft from Moody to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor shall provide all defense services and supplies, as well as repair and return of repairable units. All parts are subject to State Department/ITAR import and export approval. The Contractor shall be responsible for import and export licenses, technical assistance agreements, and approvals. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall implement procedures to&nbsp;safeguard critical protected information (such as proprietary data), systems, and components. The Contractor shall also protect any components that include anti-tamper provisions already built in. <br />&bull; Embraer, the A-29 OEM, owns all technical data and software relevant to the A-29 program. No data is anticipated to be purchased by the program office at this time. The US Government will provide industry with all relevant data included in the Contract Data Requirement Lists under contract FA8637-13-D-6003 Delivery Order 0001. <br />&bull; Supplying AAF pilots, AAF maintainers and aircraft fuel are NOT the responsibility of the Contractor.<br />&bull; USG and/or Coalition Forces will provide security and base life support services (i.e., meals, lodging, postal service, etc.) in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>1.3 Additional Information:<br />&bull; The USG requires support and training through the end of the US Train, Advise, and Assist Command-Air mission. A Status of Forces Agreement and Bilateral Security Agreement were signed on 30 September 2014 and took effect on 01 January 2015. These agreements are valid until 2024. This contract would be subject to any amendments to these agreements.<br />&bull; The changing environment and unknown future requirements include, but are not limited to: the security environment, schedule, training, and basic program requirements (technical, place(s) of performance, duration of performance, and USG withdrawal strategy).<br />&bull; Aircraft repairable spares and consumables: The current contractor procured A-29 spares and consumables to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. The spares (and associated sustainment) as well as replenishment of consumables is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; Government Furnished Property (GFP) and Ground Support Equipment (GSE): The USG provides very few pieces of GFP in support of this program. The current contractor procured A-29 unique GSE and brought additional common GSE to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. This equipment and associated sustainment responsibility is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; All A-29 aircraft in Afghanistan are titled to the country of Afghanistan.</p>

<DESC><strong>Product Manager Electro Optic Infrared Payloads (PdM EO/IR)<br />Request for Information (RFI)</strong>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Product Manager Electro-optic / Infrared (PdM EO/IR) is conducting market research to ascertain if there are any changes in the market place for sustainment support to suite of EO/IR Sensors, specifically sensors provided by L-3 Wescam and known as the MX series of sensor systems (e.g., MX-10, MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25) that have been previously integrated, qualified and tested on distinct Army platforms currently fielded and in support of units operating worldwide. New procurement and sustainment support are only intended for the MX-15, MX-20, and MX-25 variants. Sustainment support is only intended for the MX-10 variant that is currently within the Government fleet of manned and unmanned systems currently supporting the Warfighter in continental U.S. (CONUS) and outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) operations. No new procurement or battle damage replacements are intended for the MX-10 variant. The Government plans to award a ceiling increase to its existing sustainment-support contract previously awarded to Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) on behalf of L-3 Wescam Inc. (in accordance with Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 225.870-1(c)). That contract was not competed per authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1-Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Government is not currently able to procure the rights to the technical data required to support the MX Sensor Systems. The work covered by the basic contract and the additional work to be obtained by the proposed ceiling increase is the same scope of efforts. The increase is due to three factors. First, there has been continued and in some cases increases in Other Contingency Operations (OCO) worldwide in which MX Sensor Systems are in direct support. Second, this action accounts for Operational Need Statements (ONS) and other urgent requirements for MX Sensors Systems or services in the FY16/17 time-frame in support of direct theater requirements where the Soldiers and/or field commanders identified specific MX Sensor requirements to meet the emergent threat. Lastly, a portion of this action will be providing sustainment support due to the increases in the number of MX Sensors.</p>
<p>This effort will include procurement of MX sensors to support ONS requests and sustainment support to these existing MX Sensors in the Army's inventory. Specifically the support includes; delivery of up to ten (10) replacement sensor systems per year to replace battle damaged units (MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25 variants only), upgrade/modification to address obsolescence and sustainment support to include repair parts, maintenance, special test equipment, field service representatives (FSRs) and Training for MX-10, MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25 variants. The Government is interested in approaches, facilities, resources, contractual relationships and other capabilities that may contribute to improved value to the Government (cost, schedule, and performance) in the sustainment of these existing series of sensor systems (MX-10, MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25).<br /><br />Vendors that respond to this RFI shall provide evidence that they can meet the following objectives related to production, modification, maintenance and sustainment support for the MX series of sensor systems.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Sustainment only of small Size EO/IR sensor (MX-10D) for tactical unmanned aerial systems (TUAS) that meet the following performance objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p>Precision stabilized gimbal with inertial measurement unit (IMU) inside and auto video tracker (AVT). Integrated electronics unit, high-definition (HD) digital and analog video output.</p>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for the production of Cal .50 M1 High Pressure Test (HPT) Cartridges, DODIC A575. This cartridge is used in the production of .50 caliber machine guns (M2 Fixed, M2 Flex, M2A1) as well as for the production of .50 caliber bolts, barrels and barrel extensions. M1 HPT is a test cartridge with no field uses or field requirements. Due to special testing configurations at some vendors, the chamber pressure requirement of this cartridge must be consistent when fired in the orientation of their test fixture or when fired as part of the .50 caliber machine gun system. A cartridge may be fired either horizontally or vertically straight down for the pressure test of each barrel manufactured. If fired vertically straight down and there is an ullage gap in the cartridge, the propellant will be oriented towards the bullet with the ullage gap between the primer and the propellant. If fired horizontally in a test barrel, the cartridge may be rolled to orient the propellant towards the primer resulting in a higher pressure than if no propellant orientation is made. In addition, that barrel is tested a second time as part of the .50 caliber system. The slamming of a cartridge into the chamber of the barrel means the propellant may shift in any orientation to fill and move the ullage. The Government seeks a HPT Cartridge that is not affected by either of these test conditions. A likely solution is one with little or no ullage space present in the cartridge; although, any other working solutions would be considered. A commercial off-the-shelf item is strongly preferred.
<p>Specifications: Cal .50 High Pressure Test Cartridges, DODIC A575, is purchased to Technical Data Package military specification MIL-DTL-60162A w/Amd 3 dtd 23 Nov 2015, and U.S. Revision M, top level drawing 5544097 dated 09 November 2015 Distribution D, approved for release to Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors. To obtain these documents, a DD 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement is required to the point of contact below. The Handling/Destroying of Unclassified/Limited Distribution documents shall be handled using the same standard as "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" material, and shall be destroyed by any method that will prevent disclosure of contents or reconstruction of the document.</p>
<p>Alternate designs may be submitted for consideration by the Government as long as the HPT cartridges meet the pressure requirements as stated in MIL-DTL 60162A w/Amd 3 Item 3.6, "Chamber pressure". Average pressure, standard deviations, and maximum pressure requirements must be consistent when fired in test fixtures as described above.</p>
<p>Planned Acquisition: The anticipated requirement is for the manufacture and delivery of up to 400K each Cal .50 High Pressure Test Cartridges under a Firm Fixed Price contract. This one time buy is planned for FY18.</p>
<p>Submission Information: All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their capability/qualification data with regard to the above, no later than 30 days from the date of this notice to: U.S. Army Contracting Center, Attn: Kevin Gilmore, Rock Island Arsenal, IL or at kevin.c.gilmore.civ@mail.mil.

The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).<br /><br />Background<br />As one of the state-of-the-art manufacturing approaches listed in the FDA's strategic plan for advancing regulatory science (2011), continuous manufacturing has been discussed in recent pharmaceutical conferences and holds great promise for the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing. In April 2016, pharmaceutical advanced manufacturing has been identified as the nation's priority technology areas by the White House. Given the rapid development of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry, there is an urgent need to establish a laboratory-scale continuous manufacturing line in DPQR to upgrade its research infrastructure to meet the advanced manufacturing regulatory research need. Since feeding is the first step for any continuous manufacturing processes, we propose to purchase a feeding system that enables to feed various types of pharmaceutical ingredients. A micro feeder is a necessary component to establish such a feeding system, especially for feeding of lubricant, or for low-drug content scenarios. The established system will enable DPQRs continuous manufacturing research program to showcase the state-of-the-art manufacturing research infrastructure for integrated continuous manufacturing and real-time process monitoring and control.<br />Scope<br /><br />The vendor shall deliver a Micro-feeder which meets the following specification: <br /><br />&bull; product contact metal parts are in stainless steel with pharmaceutical grade metal finish, nonmetal product contact parts are made of FDA compliant materials ((http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/RegulatoryStatusFoodContactMaterial/ucm120771.htm)<br />&bull; hopper volume should be no more than 2L<br />&bull; capable of feeding with the rate between 0.07-4 hr. <br />&bull; twin-screw interchangeable feeding tools that are capable of gravimetric feeding free flowing to very poorly flowing powders<br />&bull; interchangeable twin screws with different sizes (for example 12mm and 16mm)<br />&bull; compact horizontal design<br />&bull; easy access to parts for cleaning <br />&bull; equipped with control system to enable operator control at the interface. <br />&bull; includes control systems that assure feeding accuracy during re-fill with a stabilization time of not more than 1 minute.<br />&bull; includes operational software for download on customer supplied PC<br />&bull; enclosed weight sensor and drive motor with high torque for handling difficult materials, such as fluffy, cohesive, and dense materials<br />&bull; must have polish level II coating on hopper and feeder</p>
<p>Also Includes:<br />&bull; System crating, shipping, and delivery<br />&bull; Full system software and peripheral installation and verification of performance<br />&bull; The instrument must be a newly manufactured unit, not used and refurbished or previously used for demonstration. <br />&bull; The entire system must be warranted for parts and labor for 12 months from the date of installation. Software updates to be furnished at no additional cost during the warranty period. Technical support to be furnished at no additional cost during the warranty period.<br />&bull; Onsite training on the use and features of this instrument is required. <br /><br />CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>The FDA is requesting interested, qualified small businesses to provide a capability statement showing their ability and willingness to complete this requirement. The capability statement will be sent electronically to Lisa Yaw at Lisa.Yaw@fda.hhs.gov in a commonly used format, such as Microsoft Word or pdf. <br /><br />This capability statement will be no more than five pages, excluding a cover page and table of contents, and will include examples of successfully completing relevant similar work, including a description of the similar work and client contact information.

<DESC><strong>Type of Notice:</strong>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) began work in China because of the unique circumstances allowing scientific study of esophageal cancer.  The extraordinary rates of disease in Linxian (20-25% of deaths are due to this disease) coupled with the numerous documented nutritional inadequacies made this a model environment to test the hypothesis that nutritional supplements could prevent cancer.  Both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia cancer (GCC) occur at epidemic rates in this population, share some etiologic risk factors, and prior to widespread use of endoscopy and biopsy, were diagnosed as a single disease referred to as "esophageal cancer" or "hard of swallowing disease".</p>
<p>Enabled by the establishment of a cancer field station in Linxian by the Chinese in the late 1950s and the opening of China to the West in the 1970s, NCI initiated collaborative studies of esophageal cancer with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS) in 1982.  Pilot studies were followed by a case-control study and the Nutrition Intervention Trials (NITs).</p>
<p>With the conclusion of the NIT interventions in 1991, attention turned to the etiology and the early detection of Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers, where studies were started in members of the trial cohorts as well as other high-risk and diseased subjects in Linxian.  These studies have been conducted over the years through 2 separate but overlapping projects:  the Nutrition Intervention Trials and Follow-up Study, and the Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer (EDEC) Project.  These previously separate projects were combined into a single project to gather data and information related to participants of UGI cancer in Linxian.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to continue providing support for the prevention and early detection of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to follow-up on strategies to reduce mortality from esophageal and gastric cancer in Linxian, China where rates of these cancers are the highest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Major tasks required of the successful contractor include the following:</p>
<p><strong>1.	Project Implementation Planning:</strong><br />&bull;	Complete and submit to the National Cancer Institute a written project plan for carrying out the requirements of the Statement of Work.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice<br />Electronic Monitoring Installation and Training
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for a commercial acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, and Eastern Acquisition Division is conducting market research to determine potential sources capable of providing electronic monitoring installation and training as detailed herein:</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $15,000,000 or less. This is not a request for technical or cost proposals. All types of business concerns, large businesses, small businesses, and nonprofit and educational institutions are encouraged to submit a brief (no more than five pages), typed Capability Statement in response to this sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>The nature of the work to be performed includes supporting regulations for the pelagic longline fishery, which would include individual bycatch quotas (IBQ) for bluefin tuna (intended to limit the catch of bluefin, increase individual accountability, and provide strong incentives to avoid bluefin), and bluefin catch reporting through currently existing Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS). In order to ensure a robust reporting and monitoring system, regulations require that vessels install and operationalize electronic video monitoring as a means to verify the accuracy of counts and identification of bluefin reported by the vessel operator via mandatory logbooks or VMS reports (audit approach).

<p>DISA Development and Business Center (BDC) Services Development Directorate (SD) is seeking industry input in shaping and procuring a commercial cloud based email and calendaring service based on industry best practices and within the context of other Agencies ongoing initiatives to implement Presidential Directives, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Mandates, and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) Commercial Cloud Services Directives.</p>
<p><br />This RFI invites industry to submit information, comments, capabilities, and recommendations for potential development and implementation of acquisition vehicles and corresponding solutions to facilitate DISA's replacement of the current unclassified DoD Enterprise Email (DEE) 1.0 email and calendaring service functions to include Security Requirements Guide (SRG) impact levels 1-5 (refer to DoD SRG v1r1, January 2015 for jurisdiction/location requirements).&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Given the evolution of email and calendaring offerings since DEE 1.0 was implemented in 2012, DISA is interested in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>exploring all available options, including cloud technologies to offer lower-cost, highly-available services to the DoD community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DoD security policies have evolved and expanded the possible hosting options to deliver cloud-based email services (DEE 2.0) to the DoD community. These range from the current DoD on-premise approach to a commercial vendor-premise deployment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We realize that each hosting approach is associated with a number of planning, technical, and contracting considerations and we solicit vendor feedback and recommendations on approaches that would maximize effectiveness and cost efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Below are examples of two (2) cloud-based email deployment approaches which will be considered as possible alternatives to DEE 1.0.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While we recognize that shared cloud environments may provide significant opportunities, they also present unique risks to DoD data and systems that must be addressed.</p>

The VA is conducting market research/seeking capable sources from bondable and experienced firms that are classified and registered in www.vip.vetbiz.gov as either Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) or Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB). The NAICS Code is 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property, and the small business size standard is $38.5 million. Responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining if the acquisition should be set-aside for competition restricted to SDVOSB or VOSB concerns in accordance with 38 USC Sec. 8127. Although this notice focuses on SDVOSB and VOSB, we encourage ALL small businesses and other interested parties to respond for market research purposes.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Advanced Systems and Development Directorate (AD), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, hereby issues the following special notice.
<p>Synopsis: <br />The purpose of this announcement is to formally communicate the Government's plan to conduct a Space Enterprise Vision (SEV) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Industry Day event to provide an overview of the SEV and forthcoming BAA. Air Force Space Command is developing a new integrated SEV and associated architectures across all of its space mission areas. The US military seeks innovative concepts to preserve its asymmetrical advantage given a contested, degraded, and operationally-limited space environment. As a result, the space enterprise architecture and associated systems engineering approach will need to be more agile, flexible, responsive and modular. SMC/AD, in coordination with SMC/LE, is seeking innovative enterprise architectures (satellite, launch, and ground), new space and launch segment concepts, and ideas for prototype demonstrations to improve resiliency while maintaining affordability. The Industry Day will occur in the Titan Conference Room on the El Segundo Aerospace Campus on 28 February and 1 March, 2017. The general session will occur on 28 February, 2017, from 0800-1200 PDT, followed by one-on-one vendor discussions from 13:30-16:30 PDT, and continuing on 1 March, 2017 from 07:30-16:30 PDT. The general session will be UNCLASSIFIED and informational only. One-on-one sessions will be available at different classification levels (e.g. Unclassified, Secret and Top Secret/SCI).

Within the verification letter, please provide: each individual's name, email address, phone number, organization, date of birth, driver's license state, driver's license number, and indicate if they are a U.S. Citizen. Due to space availability, each company's attendance will be restricted to five personnel.</p>
<p>The POC will also be able to provide the final details of how to gain access to the Aerospace Campus and where the briefings will be held. Each attendee will be required to bring a Government-issued photo ID such as a current driver's license, Common Access Card (CAC), or passport, and current proof of employment (e.g., company employee badge).</p>
<p>Companies requesting to schedule a one-on-one session for company personnel should contact the POC for further instruction with a list of requested attendees prior to 1600 PDT on 16 February, 2017.

<p>Request for Information (RFI) number "W56KGY-15-D-0007_Modification" was posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on 16 December 2016 and closed on 31 December 2016. The purpose of the RFI is to conduct market research to ascertain if there are any changes in the market place for sustainment support to the MX series of sensor systems that have been previously integrated, qualified, and tested on distinct Army platforms. Under this sustainment contract, the Army may procure, in addition to the MX-10 laser designator rangefinder payload, one or more of the sensor variants within the family of MX sensors, which are integrated onto a multitude of platforms.</p>
<p>The following definitions are provided for clarity in understanding the types of MX sensors.<br />&bull;DR - designator ready (payload has illuminator and laser range finder)<br />&bull;D - designator (payload has laser range finder, illuminator and designator)<br />&bull;HDi - payload has high definition capability<br />&bull;DiD - payload has high definition capability with designator</p>
<p>The Government plans to purchase and sustain the following MX sensors under this contract.<br />&bull;MX-25D and MX-25<br />&bull;MX-20D and MX-20<br />&bull;MX-15HDi and MX-15DiD<br />&bull;MX-10D and MX-10DR*</p>
<p>*NOTE: Any MX-10D and MX-10DR will only be sustained under this contract. The MX-10D is a laser designator range finder. The MX-10DR has a laser range finder, just not the designator. They are two different systems. The range finder determines the range to a target, the laser designator provides a discrete coded laser used in weapons engagements and target hand overs.</p>
<p>In response to the RFI, a prospective vendor submitted questions. Before the Army offers answers the vendor's questions, it is important to point out that W56KGY-15-D-0007 SUSTAINS the existing fleet of MX sensors (which supports multiple platforms across the Army). However, in SUSTAINING the MX sensor fleet, units may become extensively battle damaged or be beyond economical repair (BER). Consequently, the Army needs and intends to buy all types of MX sensors, excluding the MX-10D and MX-10DR for the Army TUAS Shadow Program, for replacement purposes lest the Warfighter lose full mission capability. The Army also intends to meet directed non-Shadow Operational Needs Statements (ONS) MX sensor needs utilizing W56KGY-15-D-0007. However, the Army will not procure new MX-10D or MX-10DR sensors to satisfy a new requirement for the Army TUAS Shadow Program (including for an ONS) by procuring MX-10D or MX-10DR sensors. The Government's answers to these questions follow below.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Please confirm that there are no instances, circumstances, or conditions whatsoever that would allow new MX-10 laser designator range finder payloads to be procured via the existing contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) or through any current or anticipated modification to this contract? If this cannot be confirmed, please state all conditions, circumstances, or instances that would allow any such procurement of the MX-10.</p>
<p><strong>Government Response:</strong> At the current time, the Government will not procure new MX-10 laser designator range finder payloads for the Army TUAS Shadow Program under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Does the basic contract SOW provide for the new purchase of any MX-10 laser designator range finder payload(s)? The interested parties request a copy of the Basic Contract.</p>
<p><strong>Government Response:</strong> The Performance Work Statement (PWS) is sufficiently broad to include the purchase of new of MX-10 laser designator range finder payloads, but as stated above, the Army will not procure new MX-10 laser designator range finder payloads under this sustainment contract for the Army TUAS Shadow Program. Interested parties seeking a copy of the Contract may submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the appropriate point of contact.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Please identify which MX sensors have been identified to meet emergent threats. If sustainment is only a portion of this action, please identify any and all other activities that would be supported through the work scope identified in this RFI. Please note that the introduction contained at the start of the RFI states that this RFI and ceiling increase is ONLY for sustainment; therefore, please explain how sustainment can be considered to be the last portion of this action and not its entirety? Based on ONS or other urgent requirements, is there any way through which the MX-10 sensor can be purchased under this contract vehicle? If so, is there a defined number, minimum, or maximum of MX-10 units that can be purchased per year?<br /><br /><strong>Government Response:</strong> The Army declines to discuss emergent threats and, relative to the remaining questions, to satisfy an ONS, the Army may procure new MX sensors and/or replacement MX sensors that are battle damaged/Beyond Economic Repair (BER). That said, the Army confirms that no new MX-10D or MX-10DR sensors for the Army TUAS Shadow Program will be procured under this sustainment contract.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Please explain all contents of any "upgrade/modification" anticipated or sought through this RFI and related in any way to the MX-10.</p>
<p><strong>Government Response:</strong> The term "Upgrade/modification" in reference to the MX-10 Payloads (MX-10, MX-10D, MX-10DR) is to address Sustainment Support and Obsolescence for those currently in Army inventory so that they are Fully Mission Capable (FMC) with no critical maintenance and no safety deficiencies. Under this sustainment contract, the Army will not procure any variety of payload for the Army TUAS Shadow Program, but the Army may procure new payloads for the purpose of sustaining existing payloads (MX-10, MX-15, MX-20, MX-25) that support other programs and platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Does this statement include the procurement of MX-10 laser designator range finder payloads to support ONS requests directly intended for the Army TUAS Shadow Program?</p>
<p><strong>Government Response:</strong> No, there are no conditions, circumstances, or instances where an MX-10 laser designator range finder payload will be procured on this contract for the Army TUAS Shadow Program.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC) is a cooperative arrangement among laboratory accreditation bodies, not an organization. The procurement request pays for Annual Membership for services to the signatories (members) of the agreement under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.1 using the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b) Not Exceeding Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p>APLAC is a regional cooperation among accreditation bodies in the Asia Pacific region. Initially these accreditation bodies accredited testing and calibration laboratories. Increasingly, however, they now also accredit inspection bodies, reference material producers, and other related services. Part of APLAC's role is to provide a forum for the exchange of information among its members on accreditation and related issues, with the aim of continual improvement of accreditation services offered in the region. Through the APLAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) APLAC facilitates the acceptance by Governments and industry in each economy of reports and certificates from facilities accredited by signatories to the MRA.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 813920, and the size standard is $15.5 Million.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on February 21, 2017. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Harry.Brubaker@NIST.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

The US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (USACE) has a requirement to obtain, One Cisco Brand 2921 Routers, 2 security Stack Devices, firewall. Cisco Systems and Update Rights &amp; Product Technical Support Licenses are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates that other CHESS contractor's similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. <br />Continuing to use Cisco brand equipment means that the Army will continue to be part of a single framework, increasing both data redundancy and ease of management. We intend to purchase the required support by awarding a competitive firm fixed price delivery order through the Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) program which is the Army's designated primary source for commercial IT. In accordance with the CHESS ordering guidelines, the Fair Opportunity will be given to all six ITES-2H multiple award contract holders. A brand name justification has been approved and is being posted with this announcement. Delivery is required 30 days after the award of the order. Market research has revealed that more than one ITES-2H multiple award contract holder can provide the required support. When this is true the procurement must be made from CHESS IAW AFARS 5139.101. Responses to this announcement must be emailed directly to Alicia Powell, the Contract Specialist, at Alicia.s.powell@usace.army.mil. <br />

Section 6-17 provides that even "minor alterations without the manufacturer's consent may negate any further manufacturer product liability." AR 40-61 lists four circumstances under which Army medical maintenance personnel may modify medical equipment: modification work order, quality assurance alteration, minor alteration, and component modernization. All require manufacturer involvement or consent.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 6.302-1(a), with the University of Pittsburgh as the only responsible source that can provide Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for evaluation of neurotherapeutic resuscitation strategies in polytrauma associated with traumatic brain injury through a specialized mouse model developed at the University.
<p><br />1.0	SCOPE OF WORK: This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the procurement of the technical expertise and support services necessary to refine animal models of military relevant brain injury by better understanding the co-morbidities during the sub-acute and chronic timeframe after injury. This work supports the mission of the Brain Trauma, Neuroprotection and Neurorestoration (BTNN) Branch, Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).</p>
<p>2.0	BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) is to conduct biomedical research that is responsive to Department of Defense and U.S. Army requirements and delivers lifesaving products including knowledge, technology, and medical materiel that sustain the combat effectiveness of the war fighter. Brain Trauma Neuroprotection and Neurorestoration (BTNN) Branch, Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience, of the WRAIR conducts preclinical research of mild-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), specifically the penetrating ballistic-type TBI and closed head impact concussion for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). Research specializes in "polytrauma", accounting for the impact of hemorrhagic shock and failure to oxygenate and/or ventilate on the progression brain injury.</p>
<p>This research collaboration will evaluate a novel neurotherapeutic resuscitation strategy for treating TBI in the event of hemorrhagic shock during the pre-hospital phase. The findings will be the basis for future preclinical studies with delayed/long-term treatments and will provide important knowledge for future clinical studies. The research will provide insight leading to improvements in clinical practice guidelines to optimize resuscitation approaches for patients with TBI (i.e. approaches to optimize cerebral perfusion and brain salvage).  Successful translation of solutions generated from the research will improve stabilization and salvage of neurologic injuries at all echelons of care.</p>

<DESC><strong><br />INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:</strong>
<p>Phillips Research Site (PRS) is home to the Air Force Research Laboratory's Space Vehicles (RV) and Directed Energy (RD) Directorates. The mission of the Space Vehicles Directorate is to develop space technologies that support evolving space related warfighter requirements. Primary areas of importance include but are not limited to communications, positioning, navigation and timing, space, cyber space modeling and simulation, space evaluation and analysis assessments, defensive space control, space situational awareness and intelligence, and surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as performing a variety of integrated space technology experiments. The mission of the Directed Energy Directorate is to develop advanced directed energy technologies that support evolving tactical and strategic warfighter requirements. Primary areas of importance include but are not limited to high-powered electromagnetics, laser systems directed energy and electro-optics for space superiority, and directed energy weapons modeling and simulation.</p>
<p>AFRL/RVKDT, 3550 Aberdeen Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117, is looking for 8(a) concerns that have Top Secret (TS)/SCI eligibility to perform administrative, business, financial and staff related support for their technical and functional divisions, the business offices within the division, as well as individual projects, branches, and divisions on-site at Kirtland Air Force Base and their geographically separated units. <br />PRS requires skilled administrative-type services for vital, non-research and development activities to efficiently and effectively support both Directorates to successfully perform their technical missions. Both Directorates have combined equivalent non-research and development functions across the PRS in order to gain efficiency, achieve cost savings, and ensure continuity of operations across the Site. The majority of the anticipated task orders under this acquisition will require a Secret clearance; however, one task order currently envisioned requires the TS/SCI eligibility to perform its mission. Eligibility means current SCI with Single Scope Background Investigation adjudicated for SCI.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to obtain Non-Personal services for various types of business, administrative, and management (non-supervisory) services. These services are to support the RV and RD Directorates management and operations at various organizational levels to include geographically separated units or locations with an AFRL presence, their technical and functional divisions, the business offices within the divisions, and RV and RD branches and divisions.</p>
<p>AFRL contemplates an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price commercial contract with specific individual task orders issued by the Contracting Officer. The ordering period of the IDIQ is five (5) years. The period of performance for each task order issued will have one (1) basic year and four (4) option years. 98% of the labor category requirements are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards (FAR Subpart 22.10). The Performance Work Statement is attached. Previous AFRL RV/RD administrative service contracts were solicited as 8(a) competitive acquisitions.

<p>b.	Factor 1: Technical Capability<br />1.

<p>(xiii) ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS AND/OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br />1.	See Attachment 3 for applicable provisions and clauses. <br />2.	FAR 13.004 - LEGAL AFFECT OF QUOTATIONS<br />(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)</p>
<p>(xiv) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) does not apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xv) Attachment 3 - Contractor Submittal Form, must be fully completed and submitted. Questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing no later than 4:00 PM MST, 27 February, 2017.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) located in Washington, DC has a requirement for a Schopper Fold Tester. Folding Endurance Testers have been used for the estimation for the suitability of the paper in use to withstand repeated bending, folding, and creasing. Fold endurance measures the durability of paper when repeatedly folded under constant load; determining how many times the paper can be folded until it breaks. The folding strength is quoted as the number of double folds and the folding endurance is the log10 of the number of double folds.<br />The tester is primarily used for testing papers that are frequently handled such as currency (bank note) papers, maps and wrapping papers. The ageing characteristics of a paper can be assessed by measuring fold endurance before and after accelerated environmental ageing.

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is located in multiple buildings and locations throughout the Washington metropolitan area and throughout the United States.  FDA is in need of technical and non-technical Audio Visual (AV) and conference, meeting and training room support at its various locations.  Meetings and conferences consist of a variety of types of meetings including; routine operational formats; executive meetings; public meetings where the Press is in attendance; and highly technical scientific presentations and work sessions where information technology, telecommunications and AV support services are required.  Services shall include direct support for FDA personnel in their use of technology during meetings; in designing new AV systems; in the installation of systems; and in the ongoing service of equipment/systems.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to provide an overview of services to be provided on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity basis.</p>
<p>The consolidation of over 8,500 personnel to the White Oak campus has allowed the Agency to gain the benefit of accessing rooms on a shared use basis among the various component organizations located there. The Central Shared Use building and the Great Room in Building 31 at the White Oak campus are designed to provide shared meeting space requiring central scheduling and AV support. Additionally, the most recently occupied buildings located in the Southeast Quadrant of the campus were occupied by three organizational components of FDA including the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).  To derive the benefit of shared meeting space, central AV and meeting room support is provided to over 100 meeting rooms in this group of buildings.  A contract is presently in place to support the White Oak Conference Center and the Southeast Quadrant building with AV Support.</p>
<p>In addition to AV support services this requirement is for design services; installation services; and ongoing equipment maintenance at the White Oak campus and other FDA locations.  The ability to provide AV services including the use of telecommunication and information technology equipment allows FDA to leverage sophisticated technology to enhance and support meetings and reduce travel requirements.  FDA routinely uses integrated telecommunications technology, such as Cisco WebEx , Adobe Connectpro and Cisco Video Teleconference equipment to enhance its meeting capabilities; to broadcast special events and public meetings; and to allow personnel working from alternative worksites to participate in meetings.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quotations will be made. For those offerors which are determined to be technically acceptable, award will be made to that vendor with the lowest overall price. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the technical acceptable/not acceptable process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the evaluation process. The Government intends to make an award based on the initial quotations. If further questions are required, the contracting officer may contact the offeror or offerors. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and also provides the best value to the Government based on the results of the evaluation described in paragraph (b) below.</p>
<p>(b) The LPTA evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Acceptability. Each offeror's technical quotations will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach that meets the requirements of Statement of work and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of those requirements.</p>
<p>An evaluation rating of Technically Acceptable / Non-Acceptable will be assigned upon completion of the technical quotations evaluation. If an Offeror receives a technical rating of "Non-Acceptable" they will not be considered for award. Technical quotations shall be limited to no more than 10 pages using Microsoft Word format, 12pt times New Times Roman font, double-spaced with 1 inch margins.</p>
<p>(2) Price Quotations: The offeror's Price quotations will be evaluated by line item and the offerors with the lowest overall Price will be ranked accordingly.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice.

Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition Operations, Technology Acquisition Center, located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ, intends to issue a full and open solicitation for an existing commercially available, off-the-shelf online patient self-scheduling system.

On December 16, 2016 House Resolution 4352 (Public Law (PL) 114-286),  Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016  was enacted directing the VA to carry out a pilot program in not less than three Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN) to evaluate the capability of an existing commercially available, off-the-shelf online patient self-scheduling system to schedule and confirm medical appointments in accordance with the seven congressionally mandated requirements at Section 3(a). 

PL 114-286 requires an existing commercially available system that provides Veterans the ability to use an Internet website and mobile application to schedule and confirm medical appointments at VA medical facilities.  The solution shall provide the capability to run on the operating system of a cellular telephone, tablet computer, or similar portable computing device that transmits data over a wireless connection.  The seven congressionally mandated requirements are:  

1. Capabilities to schedule, modify, and cancel appointments for primary care, specialty care, and mental health.
2. Capability to support appointments for the provision of health care regardless of whether such care is provided in person or through telehealth services.
3. Capability to view appointment availability in real time.
4. Capability to make available, in real time, appointments that were previously filled but later cancelled by other patients.
5. Capability to provide prompts or reminders to Veterans to schedule follow-up appointments.
6. Capability to be used 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
7. Capability to integrate with the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) of the Department, or such successor information technology system.

The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541512. 
This solicitation shall close on February 27, 2017 at 12:00pm EST.  Questions shall be submitted to Joanne DeFazio, Contract Specialist, at Joanne.Defazio@va.gov, and Contracting Officer, Juan Quinones, at Juan.Quinones@va.gov, no later than 12:00pm EST on February 16, 2017 with the subject line as the RFP number, VA118-17-R-1848.

<p>Amendment 0003 is issued to address one final question/comment regarding the specifications:</p>
<p>Comment: The NPSHR of the new Goulds pump (8RJLO) seems closer to 10 than it is to 6.</p>
<p>Response: Speed can affect the NPSHR. A speed of 1800 rpm will bring the NPSHR within the spec requirement. The brand name spec model is modified to indicate a speed of 1800 rpm. <br />The pumps required are Brand Name or Equal to Goulds Model VIT-DIFM (Ductile Iron Flanged Column), 8RJLO, 1800 rpm with 5 stages with the specifications per Attachment 1 to Amendment 0002.</p>
<p>The due date for quotes remains unchanged. Quotes are due by Friday 02/17/2017 at 4:30 pm PT.</p>

<DESC>2/10/2017 - The purpose of this amendment is to extend the deadline from 2/10/17 at 5:00 PM EST to 2/14/17 at 5:00 PM EST.&nbsp; These two (2) additional business days will allow more prospective offerors to finalize and submit proposals.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Library of Congress (Library) requires contract support to procure expert environmental management and analysis services to ensure the long-term preservation of its collections. This FY17 work supports the ongoing effort to identify, analyze, and mitigate environmental risks to the permanent collections of the Library when on display or in storage on Capitol Hill or one of several offsite campuses. Additionally,&nbsp; this effort and expert service is required for the review of new storage construction for high value collection storage as well as bulk storage at Ft. Meade modules and leased space at Cabin Branch. While Library Conservation Division staff have developed significant expertise in the areas of environmental monitoring and analysis through the use of expert service contracts, continued expert consultation is needed for new construction with the related Conservation responsibility to identify climate parameters,<br />testing and control requirements, upgraded HVAC controls and other potential changes that impact collection environments.<br /><br />This procurement includes a single-year consultation contract to focus on the targeted needs identified and anticipated for the period of performance. The contract requires a balance of onsite and offsite consultation with the ability to remotely review environmental data and/or mechanical plans as deemed necessary by the COR. The Conservation Division /Preservation Directorate will successfully assess, identify and work collaboratively with Facility Operations and Architect of the Capitol staff to enhance risk reduction through improved monitoring and data sharing as well as ongoing review of settings, necessary operational adjustments or equipment improvements where needed.

AMENDMENT # 4 - SFO # VA101-15-R-0122
Lincoln, NE


PART I BASIC SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS

SECTION 1.5 OFFER DUE This section has been deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

Offers are due by March 1, 2017, 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET), and must remain open until award.  VA currently anticipates award on or before September 15, 2017.  Offers must remain open, and pricing must remain valid, until 60 calendar days following award date. 

SECTION 2.2.2 PRICE EVALUATION - This section has been deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

The basic price offered will be the rate per Net Usable Square Foot (NUSF). Refer to Paragraph 3.14 of this Solicitation for a definition of NUSF. This price shall be used to determine the total annual rental to be paid, adjusted for any discrepancies in the quantity of space delivered against the amount offered and accepted, as described elsewhere in this Solicitation. 

If annual CPI adjustments in operating expenses are included, the Offeror shall be required to submit the offer with the total "gross" annual price per rentable square foot and a breakout of the "base" price per rentable square foot for services and utilities (operating expenses) to be provided by the Lessor. The "gross" price shall include the "base" price. The first year s adjusted base price per rentable square foot will be the new base price for the second year of the lease. The second year will be the new base year upon which annual adjustments will be made; beginning with the second year of the lease and each year thereafter, the Government shall pay an adjusted rent for changes in annual costs based upon the annual CPI index.

Present Value Price Evaluation

The Offeror must submit plans and any other information to demonstrate that the rentable space yields Net Usable space within the required Net Usable range.  The Government will convert the rentable prices offered in GSA Form 1364 and/or Attachment 1 to GSA Form 1364A to Net Usable prices, which will subsequently be used in the price evaluation.

Evaluation of offered prices will be on the basis of the annual shell rental rate per Net Usable square foot, including any option periods and for all items reimbursed to the Lessor in a Lump Sum payment, as annotated in Attachment 1 to GSA Form 1364A (the costs for these items are present value; therefore, it will not be discounted.)  The Government will use that data to perform a net present value price evaluation by reducing the prices per annual shell Net Usable square foot to a composite annual Net Usable square foot price as follows:

(a)  Parking and wayward areas will be excluded from the total square footage but not from the price.  For different types of space, the gross annual per square foot price will be determined by dividing the total annual rental by the total square footage minus these areas.

(b)  Free or reduced rent will be evaluated in the year in which it is offered.  The gross, averaged annual per square foot price is adjusted to reflect free rent.

(c)   Also as stated in the "Broker Commission" paragraph, the amount of any lease acquisition fee paid to VA s Broker will not be considered separately as part of this price evaluation since the value of the fee is subsumed in the gross rent rate.

(d)  (d)  To evaluate the real value of rent today, over the given term of the lease, the analysis will compound the amount of rent at a given (discount) rate based on the current discount rate available in White House Circular A-94, Appendix C. at weblink: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a094/a94_appx-c. The gross annual per Net Usable square foot shell rental costs will be discounted annually at 2.3 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.5 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) (OMB Circular No. A-94) over the entire term of the lease, to yield a net present value cost (NPV) per net usable square foot.  This will provide an annual present value of the proposed rent, for years two through the term of the lease, at this 2.3 percent discount (15-year firm term) or 2.5 percent discount (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term).

(e) If annual adjustments in operating expenses will not be made, the operating expenses will be both escalated at 2.0 percent (15-year term; 15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) compounded annually and discounted annually at 2.3 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.5 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term), then added to the net Present Value Cost (PVC) to yield the gross PVC.

(f) If annual adjustments in operating expenses will be made, the annual per square foot price, and the base cost of operating expenses, will be discounted annually at 2.3 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.5 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) to yield a net PVC per square foot. 
 
(g) To the gross PVC will be added:

 1. The cost of Government-provided services not included in the rental escalated at 2.0 percent (15-year term; 15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) compounded annually and discounted annually at 2.3 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.5 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term).

 2. The annualized (over the full term) per ANSI/BOMA Office Area square foot cost of any items, which are to be reimbursed in a lump sum payment. (The cost of these items is present value; therefore, it will not be discounted.)

 3. The cost of relocation of furniture, telecommunications, replications costs, and other move-related costs, if applicable.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE TO BE HELD 18-19 JULY 2016 IN KETTERING, OHIO.&nbsp; SEE ATTACHMENT "PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE"</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Interested vendors are encouraged to check this site often to view any updates and additions. The Government is interested in providing as much information as possible to interested vendors. If there is a particular document or specific information an interested vendor would like to see included in the Bidder's Library, please send that request to the Points of Contact identified herein.
<p>PLEASE NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SOLICITING PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. NO CONTRACT WILL RESULT FROM THIS POSTING.</p>
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION:<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the United States Government (USG) to form a binding contract. The USG is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources and subcontracting opportunities, firms that may possess the expertise, capabilities, experience and necessary data to competently and competitively respond to all requirements to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and Maintenance Training in support of the Light Air Support (LAS) A-29 aircraft and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Ground Training Devices (GTDs) for a Building a Partnership Capacity Program for the Afghanistan Air Force (AAF). The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this acquisition has not been determined.</p>
<p>1.1 BACKGROUND:<br />&bull; In order to provide a seamless continuation of operations, requirements must be met in their entirety and be in place in Afghanistan at bases to be specified (see section 5 for potential locations) as well as continued operations at Moody Air Force Base through at least CY 2019. The contractor must be able to support all contractual requirements at all locations by 01 Oct 18.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft, designated as the A-29 LAS aircraft, is a non-developmental aircraft procured from Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). SNC is presently subcontracting to Embraer, who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for their A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. The LAS aircraft mission includes conducting advanced flight training, surveillance, air interdiction, and close air ground support.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft is a single-engine, turboprop, fixed-wing aircraft, with tricycle style, retractable landing gear, tandem two-place pressurized cockpit with ejection seats, capable of operating from semi-prepared air fields and employing various munitions from North Atlantic Treaty Organization compatible hard points. <br />&bull; SNC has supported LAS aircraft production and all maintenance/supply requirements for the aircraft, GTDs, and associated support equipment for LAS operations (except for munition build up, munitions delivery and pilot aircrew flight equipment). <br />&bull; This is anticipated to be a Performance Based Services Contract with a Period of Performance (PoP) not to exceed five (5) years.<br />&bull; The contract contemplates transferring aircraft maintenance and some supply functions to the AAF with a corresponding drawdown of contractor support, in which the scope and timeline have yet to be defined. Currently, there are no plans to transition GTD CLS maintenance support to the AAF. <br />&bull; Because Afghanistan is a variable environment, there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period with little or no notice. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location.</p>
<p>1.2 REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide a qualified workforce, all spares, support equipment and consumables to perform aircraft ICS, GTD CLS, and training at a minimum of one main operating base and aircraft ICS and training at possibly three enduring (continually operational) forward operating locations in Afghanistan. Additionally, the contractor may be responsible for continued operations at Moody AFB, GA through at least CY 2019. The contractor should account for associated movement of resources (e.g., aircraft, GTDs) from Moody AFB to Afghanistan; the transitional timeline has yet to be determined. Proposed contract effort includes: <br /><br />1) Aircraft Maintenance<br />a) Launch and recovery<br />b) Aircraft Munition Loading<br />c)&nbsp;Maintain a Fully Mission Capable (FMC) rate of 80% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />d)&nbsp;Maintain a Maintenance Cancellation Rate of less than (&lt;) 5% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />e) Future metrics are in development and expect to include tracking of partially mission capable (PMC) and training<br />f) Procurement, removal and installation of Cartridge Activated Device/Propellant Activated Device (CAD/PAD) components for the ejection seat/canopy as well as all other life support components installed in the ejection seat. (Pilot aircrew life equipment (AFE) will not be the responsibility of the contractor.<br />g) The Contractor shall support a CONUS maintenance window of 12-hours per day, 6 days a week and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight. The Contractor shall support an OCONUS maintenance window of 18-hours per day, 7 days a week. This 12- or 18-hour period may begin at different times of day depending on the operations schedule. OCONUS missions may occasionally be required outside this 18-hour per day, 7 day per week maintenance window and require ability to surge to 24 hours per day at the OCONUS MOB and each OCONUS FOL. The total fleet (of 20 aircraft) Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO) is 14,400 hours annually, calculated as 60 hours per month, multiplied by the number of aircraft, and multiplied by 12 months. <br />h) At this time, DFARS 252.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk, is not anticipated to be incorporated in any subsequent contract.<br />2) GTD operation and maintenance. <br />a) Training <br />b) Maintain a Mission Effectiveness (ME) rate of 95% or higher for each GTD <br />c) GTD availability shall be planned based on 8 hours per day, 6 days per week, with the ability to surge to 12 hours per day, if required.<br />3) Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations<br />4) Transition of aircraft maintenance and some supply functions (e.g., ordering, stocking) to the AAF and sustain associated transition metrics, which have yet to be determined. <br />5) Packing, handling, shipping and transportation<br />6) Special tools and test equipment including calibration<br />7) Responsible for repair and overhaul plan of all repairable spares<br />8) Classroom academics and Structured On-the-job training (SOJT) to fully qualify trainees as A 29 maintainers and track associated metrics. The contractor will also be required to provide A-29 familiarization training to USG Air Advisors. <br />9) Maintaining and updating technical manuals and data <br />10) Program management and site management <br />11) Engineering services including airworthiness, technical support, and aircraft modifications<br />12) Field team support<br />13) Operational Flight Program (updates) and other required software and database updates to support operational requirements<br />14) Contract quality administration <br />15) Contract Deliverables Requirements List (CDRLs)<br />16) Movement of spares, ground support equipment, associated tooling, GTD, and ferry of remaining aircraft from Moody to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor shall provide all defense services and supplies, as well as repair and return of repairable units. All parts are subject to State Department/ITAR import and export approval. The Contractor shall be responsible for import and export licenses, technical assistance agreements, and approvals. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall implement procedures to&nbsp;safeguard critical protected information (such as proprietary data), systems, and components. The Contractor shall also protect any components that include anti-tamper provisions already built in. <br />&bull; Embraer, the A-29 OEM, owns all technical data and software relevant to the A-29 program. No data is anticipated to be purchased by the program office at this time. The US Government will provide industry with all relevant data included in the Contract Data Requirement Lists under contract FA8637-13-D-6003 Delivery Order 0001. <br />&bull; Supplying AAF pilots, AAF maintainers and aircraft fuel are NOT the responsibility of the Contractor.<br />&bull; USG and/or Coalition Forces will provide security and base life support services (i.e., meals, lodging, postal service, etc.) in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>1.3 Additional Information:<br />&bull; The USG requires support and training through the end of the US Train, Advise, and Assist Command-Air mission. A Status of Forces Agreement and Bilateral Security Agreement were signed on 30 September 2014 and took effect on 01 January 2015. These agreements are valid until 2024. This contract would be subject to any amendments to these agreements.<br />&bull; The changing environment and unknown future requirements include, but are not limited to: the security environment, schedule, training, and basic program requirements (technical, place(s) of performance, duration of performance, and USG withdrawal strategy).<br />&bull; Aircraft repairable spares and consumables: The current contractor procured A-29 spares and consumables to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. The spares (and associated sustainment) as well as replenishment of consumables is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; Government Furnished Property (GFP) and Ground Support Equipment (GSE): The USG provides very few pieces of GFP in support of this program. The current contractor procured A-29 unique GSE and brought additional common GSE to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. This equipment and associated sustainment responsibility is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; All A-29 aircraft in Afghanistan are titled to the country of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SOLICITING PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. NO CONTRACT WILL RESULT FROM THIS POSTING.</p>
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION:<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the United States Government (USG) to form a binding contract. The USG is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources and subcontracting opportunities, firms that may possess the expertise, capabilities, experience and necessary data to competently and competitively respond to all requirements to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and Maintenance Training in support of the Light Air Support (LAS) A-29 aircraft and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Ground Training Devices (GTDs) for a Building a Partnership Capacity Program for the Afghanistan Air Force (AAF). The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this acquisition has not been determined.</p>
<p>1.1 BACKGROUND:<br />&bull; In order to provide a seamless continuation of operations, requirements must be met in their entirety and be in place in Afghanistan at bases to be specified (see section 5 for potential locations) as well as continued operations at Moody Air Force Base through at least CY 2019. The contractor must be able to support all contractual requirements at all locations by 01 Oct 18.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft, designated as the A-29 LAS aircraft, is a non-developmental aircraft procured from Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). SNC is presently subcontracting to Embraer, who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for their A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. The LAS aircraft mission includes conducting advanced flight training, surveillance, air interdiction, and close air ground support.<br />&bull; The LAS aircraft is a single-engine, turboprop, fixed-wing aircraft, with tricycle style, retractable landing gear, tandem two-place pressurized cockpit with ejection seats, capable of operating from semi-prepared air fields and employing various munitions from North Atlantic Treaty Organization compatible hard points. <br />&bull; SNC has supported LAS aircraft production and all maintenance/supply requirements for the aircraft, GTDs, and associated support equipment for LAS operations (except for munition build up, munitions delivery and pilot aircrew flight equipment). <br />&bull; This is anticipated to be a Performance Based Services Contract with a Period of Performance (PoP) not to exceed five (5) years.<br />&bull; The contract contemplates transferring aircraft maintenance and some supply functions to the AAF with a corresponding drawdown of contractor support, in which the scope and timeline have yet to be defined. Currently, there are no plans to transition GTD CLS maintenance support to the AAF. <br />&bull; Because Afghanistan is a variable environment, there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period with little or no notice. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location.</p>
<p>1.2 REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide a qualified workforce, all spares, support equipment and consumables to perform aircraft ICS, GTD CLS, and training at a minimum of one main operating base and aircraft ICS and training at possibly three enduring (continually operational) forward operating locations in Afghanistan. Additionally, the contractor may be responsible for continued operations at Moody AFB, GA through at least CY 2019. The contractor should account for associated movement of resources (e.g., aircraft, GTDs) from Moody AFB to Afghanistan; the transitional timeline has yet to be determined. Proposed contract effort includes: <br /><br />1) Aircraft Maintenance<br />a) Launch and recovery<br />b) Aircraft Munition Loading<br />c)&nbsp;Maintain a Fully Mission Capable (FMC) rate of 80% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />d)&nbsp;Maintain a Maintenance Cancellation Rate of less than (&lt;) 5% for both CONUS and OCONUS fleets and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight.<br />e) Future metrics are in development and expect to include tracking of partially mission capable (PMC) and training<br />f) Procurement, removal and installation of Cartridge Activated Device/Propellant Activated Device (CAD/PAD) components for the ejection seat/canopy as well as all other life support components installed in the ejection seat. (Pilot aircrew life equipment (AFE) will not be the responsibility of the contractor.<br />g) The Contractor shall support a CONUS maintenance window of 12-hours per day, 6 days a week and shift to a fleet wide calculation when the total quantity of CONUS aircraft drops below eight. The Contractor shall support an OCONUS maintenance window of 18-hours per day, 7 days a week. This 12- or 18-hour period may begin at different times of day depending on the operations schedule. OCONUS missions may occasionally be required outside this 18-hour per day, 7 day per week maintenance window and require ability to surge to 24 hours per day at the OCONUS MOB and each OCONUS FOL. The total fleet (of 20 aircraft) Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO) is 14,400 hours annually, calculated as 60 hours per month, multiplied by the number of aircraft, and multiplied by 12 months. <br />h) At this time, DFARS 252.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk, is not anticipated to be incorporated in any subsequent contract.<br />2) GTD operation and maintenance. <br />a) Training <br />b) Maintain a Mission Effectiveness (ME) rate of 95% or higher for each GTD <br />c) GTD availability shall be planned based on 8 hours per day, 6 days per week, with the ability to surge to 12 hours per day, if required.<br />3) Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations<br />4) Transition of aircraft maintenance and some supply functions (e.g., ordering, stocking) to the AAF and sustain associated transition metrics, which have yet to be determined. <br />5) Packing, handling, shipping and transportation<br />6) Special tools and test equipment including calibration<br />7) Responsible for repair and overhaul plan of all repairable spares<br />8) Classroom academics and Structured On-the-job training (SOJT) to fully qualify trainees as A 29 maintainers and track associated metrics. The contractor will also be required to provide A-29 familiarization training to USG Air Advisors. <br />9) Maintaining and updating technical manuals and data <br />10) Program management and site management <br />11) Engineering services including airworthiness, technical support, and aircraft modifications<br />12) Field team support<br />13) Operational Flight Program (updates) and other required software and database updates to support operational requirements<br />14) Contract quality administration <br />15) Contract Deliverables Requirements List (CDRLs)<br />16) Movement of spares, ground support equipment, associated tooling, GTD, and ferry of remaining aircraft from Moody to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor shall provide all defense services and supplies, as well as repair and return of repairable units. All parts are subject to State Department/ITAR import and export approval. The Contractor shall be responsible for import and export licenses, technical assistance agreements, and approvals. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall implement procedures to&nbsp;safeguard critical protected information (such as proprietary data), systems, and components. The Contractor shall also protect any components that include anti-tamper provisions already built in. <br />&bull; Embraer, the A-29 OEM, owns all technical data and software relevant to the A-29 program. No data is anticipated to be purchased by the program office at this time. The US Government will provide industry with all relevant data included in the Contract Data Requirement Lists under contract FA8637-13-D-6003 Delivery Order 0001. <br />&bull; Supplying AAF pilots, AAF maintainers and aircraft fuel are NOT the responsibility of the Contractor.<br />&bull; USG and/or Coalition Forces will provide security and base life support services (i.e., meals, lodging, postal service, etc.) in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>1.3 Additional Information:<br />&bull; The USG requires support and training through the end of the US Train, Advise, and Assist Command-Air mission. A Status of Forces Agreement and Bilateral Security Agreement were signed on 30 September 2014 and took effect on 01 January 2015. These agreements are valid until 2024. This contract would be subject to any amendments to these agreements.<br />&bull; The changing environment and unknown future requirements include, but are not limited to: the security environment, schedule, training, and basic program requirements (technical, place(s) of performance, duration of performance, and USG withdrawal strategy).<br />&bull; Aircraft repairable spares and consumables: The current contractor procured A-29 spares and consumables to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. The spares (and associated sustainment) as well as replenishment of consumables is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; Government Furnished Property (GFP) and Ground Support Equipment (GSE): The USG provides very few pieces of GFP in support of this program. The current contractor procured A-29 unique GSE and brought additional common GSE to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations. This equipment and associated sustainment responsibility is expected to transfer to the contractor supporting operations beginning in FY19. <br />&bull; All A-29 aircraft in Afghanistan are titled to the country of Afghanistan.</p>

Any additional interested vendors shall provide a full response in accordance with "Section 2 Capability Survey", as well. All submissions shall be submitted to the below POC by 13 March 2017 by 1200 EST.</strong> <br /><br /><strong>1.0 DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the United States Government (USG) to form a binding contract. The USG is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources and subcontracting opportunities, firms that may possess the expertise, capabilities, experience and necessary data to competently and competitively respond to all requirements to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS), Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), and Sustainment Engineering in support of the Light Air Support (LAS) A-29 aircraft for a Building a Partnership Capacity Program with the Afghanistan Air Force (AAF). The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this acquisition has not been determined.<br /><strong><br />1.1 BACKGROUND:<br /></strong><br />&bull; In order to provide a seamless continuation of operations, requirements must be met in their entirety and be in place in Afghanistan at bases to be specified (see section 5 for potential locations) as well as continued operations at Moody Air Force Base through at least CY 2019. The contractor must be able to support all contractual requirements at all locations by 01 Oct 18.<br /><br />&bull; The LAS aircraft, designated as the A-29 LAS aircraft, is a non-developmental aircraft procured from Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC). SNC is presently subcontracting to Embraer, who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for their A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. The LAS aircraft mission includes conducting advanced flight training, surveillance, air interdiction, and close air ground support.<br /><br />&bull; The LAS aircraft is a single-engine, turboprop, fixed-wing aircraft, with tricycle style, retractable landing gear, tandem two-place pressurized cockpit with ejection seats, capable of operating from semi-prepared air fields and employing various munitions from North Atlantic Treaty Organization compatible hard points. <br /><br />&bull; SNC has supported LAS aircraft production and all maintenance/supply requirements for the aircraft, GTDs, and associated support equipment for LAS operations (except for munition build up, munitions delivery and pilot aircrew flight equipment). <br /><br />&bull; This is anticipated to be a Performance Based Services Contract with a Period of Performance (PoP) not to exceed seven (7) years (base plus four priced option years, two un-priced option years). <br /><br />&bull; The contract contemplates transferring aircraft, aircraft maintenance responsibility, and some supply functions to the AAF with a corresponding drawdown of contractor support, in which the scope and timeline have yet to be defined. Currently, there are no plans to transition CLS for GTD maintenance, Supply Chain Management, and Sustainment Engineering support to the AAF. <br />&bull; Because Afghanistan is a variable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period with little or no notice. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location.<br /><br /><strong>1.2 REQUIREMENTS:<br /></strong><br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide a qualified workforce, all spares, support equipment and consumables to perform aircraft ICS, CLS, and Sustainment Engineering at a minimum of one main operating base and aircraft ICS at possibly two enduring (continually operational) forward operating locations in Afghanistan.

<DESC><strong>Market Survey for Request for Information (RFI) in support of Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Performance &amp; Interoperability Quick-look (WIQ) 5th iteration.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /></strong>Follow on Market Survey for the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Performance &amp; Interoperability Quick-look (WIQ) 4th iteration posted on December 2, 2015, and modified/amended on March 24, 2016 under solicitation number: W15P7T16RWIQ4. <strong>https://www.fbo.gov/notices/f1ecf46f21dde6c48bc8504c33f53689</strong>
<p><strong><br />1.0 Purpose<br /></strong>The purpose of this market survey is to gain knowledge of and help the Government understand vendor interest in participating in a Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Performance &amp; Interoperability Quick-look (WIQ) 5th iteration. Information gathered from this survey will assist the Government in determining Government personnel resources and specific test schedules required to assist vendors in the Performance &amp; Interoperability Quicklook events. This Quick-look event will allow vendors from both Government-funded and independent Research and Development (R&amp;D)-funded programs to test their products with the networking waveform reference standard and other network terminals. The Government's intent of the Quick-look event is to enable a mature marketplace based on the most enhanced, operationally relevant, and sustainable tactical networking waveforms available.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong><br />Program Executive Office Command Control Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) desires to create and sustain a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Tactical Radio marketplace to support current and future full and open competition acquisitions (e.g. Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR) Full Rate Production and Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF) Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR). This RFI is intended to support this objective.<br />PM TR envisions assisting vendors participating in the WIQ by facilitating vendor waveform porting of designated WNW variants. Further, the Government will provide all vendors meeting the entrance criteria in section 3.0 below with limited Government assistance in the porting of designated Government reference WNW v4.2.2 or&nbsp;equivalent software to vendor platforms. The location of the Government's assistance can be, at the Government's discretion, at the vendor's facility or at the Government's facilities, or a combination of the two. Porting assistance can be provided prior or during the test event.<br /><br />The WIQ5 event is planned for execution starting 3 April 2017, unless revised by the Government in attempt for maximum participation. As with prior Waveform Interoperability Quicklook events, testing will be executed in two phases. Phase I will characterize a participant's WNW performance providing comparative analysis against the reference implementation. Phase I performance analysis will utilize functional system (end-to-end) testing focusing on supported functionality and performance within a homogenous (single vendor) test bed. Phase II will execute heterogeneous network (multiple WNW platforms) testing utilizing the Government WNW Research Information Lab (WRIL) Reference Test Radio (Baseline Waveform Interoperability), Program of Record (PoR) Radio (PoR Interoperability), and permitted NDI Vendor Radio(s) (Multi-Vendor Interoperability). Phase II will perform interoperability tests demonstrating a participants' ability to interoperate with other WNW implementations, as well as characterize a participants' performance within a large scale network. Each phase execution timeline is dependent on the number of participants, but each phase is expected to last two (2) continuous weeks totaling an expected four (4) weeks for WIQ5. <br /><br />Upon observation of an unexpected anomaly, the WRIL may provide limited vendor assistance for root cause analysis and corrective actions. All WIQ phases will be executed at SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic in Charleston, SC. Test reports will be provided to participating vendors and the Government with safeguards for maintaining vendor privacy.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Entrance Criteria<br /></strong>To participate in the WIQ5 event, vendors will be required to provide the following information, artifacts and equipment.<br /><strong><br />(1)</strong> Radio quantities with ported waveform versions, as follows: <br /><strong><br />a.</strong> Five (5) unclassified radios with WNW version 4.2.2 or&nbsp;equivalent (e.g. over-the-air (OTA) interoperable equivalent) ported. All COMSEC Controlled Items (CCI) must be received at test facility five (5) business days before start of test event.<br /><strong>b.</strong> All necessary ancillaries to operate the radio platforms in a laboratory environment, e.g., data/voice interface cables, power cables, etc. <br /><strong>c.</strong> Plans to address loading WNW configuration files (Radio Mission Data Sets or Radio Configuration Files). <br /><strong>d.</strong> Documentation and procedures for implementing and accepting Communication Security and Transmission Security (COMSEC and TRANSEC) loads.<br /><strong>e.</strong> Onsite authorized personnel supporting radio configuration and operation.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Documentation to enable the Government to assess the vendor's likely ability to meet the following by 1 March 2017:<br /><strong><br />a.</strong> NSA User Partnership Program (UPP) or Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) participation for Type 1 Encryption on a tactical radio or a valid authority to operate (ATO) recognized by the National Security Agency (NSA).<br /><strong>b.</strong> Standing or approved application for the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) or DoD Information Repository (IR) access and requisite Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) related to WNW with effective dates that run for no less than 10 months following the completion of WIQ5. <br /><br />Any questions regarding these events and/or entrance criteria should be addressed with the <strong>Government Technical Point of Contact (TPOC): Brett Bendt</strong>, brett.bendt@navy.mil, (843) 218-4543.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Requested Information<br /></strong>Interested vendors are invited to submit the system capabilities of their prospective software/hardware to include a summarized description of how they meet the requirements listed in paragraph 3.0. Additionally each vendor should provide a recommendation for schedule, location(s), and resources requested for porting assistance with respect to WNW v4.2.2 or equivalent. If a vendor is interested in participating in the subject test event but is not able to meet the entrance criteria as stated above, please contact the TPOC and PCO for further guidance. Any further recommendations with respect to test cases, test conditions, or instrumentation are welcomed.</p>
<p><strong>5.0 Submission Instructions and Format<br /></strong>Interested vendors are invited to respond to this market survey by providing the following information:<br /><strong>(1)</strong> Name and address of applicant/company (Corporate/Principal Office)<br /><strong>(2)</strong> Name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of point of contact<br /><strong>(3)</strong> Summarized description of how they meet the requirements listed in paragraph</p>
<p><strong>Include current version of reference implementation for WNW supported by proposed vendor platform.<br /></strong><br />This is not a request for proposals. PM TR is only seeking sources through market research at this time to determine industry interest in participating in WIQ5. The Government does not make any promise or guarantee that by submitting a response to this RFI that the vendor will be selected to participate in WIQ5. The Government will respect proprietary markings submitted for this market survey. The Government requests that vendors segregate and mark proprietary documents. The Government will provide the vendor with an acknowledgement of receipt of its response to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this market survey or any follow-up information requests. Submittals will not be returned to the sender.<br /><br /><strong>6.0 Submission<br /></strong>All responses regarding this RFI announcement shall be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist via email at gregg.g.martin.civ@mail.mil <strong>no later than 10:00 AM EST on 21 February 2017</strong>.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought for Water Quality Sample Analysis

This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified vendors may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy.

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, requires an experienced laboratory familiar with the Colorado River and its tributaries to conduct laboratory analysis of water samples.  Reclamation currently tests for chlorophyll (a,b,c), nitrogen (ammonia, nitrates/nitrites, totals, etc), phosphorous (total and ortho-), silica, chlorate (ClO4), total selenium, total suspended solids, total boron, total chromium, chromium VI and mercury.  Additional parameters may be requested depending on the project needs.

Samples are generally collected, by the Government, on a quarterly basis from the Colorado River and its tributaries.  It is estimated that 437 various samples will be collected per year.  

In addition to laboratory analysis of samples, firms will provide sample bottles for the expected number of samples collected, prepared with preservatives when necessary, and coolers sufficient to hold ice for at least 48 hours during shipping. Firms will be required to complete reporting within 30 days from the receipt of any samples.

The Government anticipates award of a single blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with a 5 year performance period to a vendor that can provide all of the required analyses outlined in this sources sought.

Responsible firms are welcome to submit a capability statement on or before March 16, 2017 by 4:00 P.M., Local Time. Submittals will be reviewed and considered by Reclamation during the solicitation planning process.  Send your capability package via email to jschilke@usbr.gov.

1.	Capability statement - showing recent experience doing this type of work or work similar in scope and complexity. (5 page maximum)
2.	Provide your business name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address.
3.	Provide your business size & type. E.g. 8(a), HubZone, Sevice Disabled Veteran, Small Business or Large Business.

<p>Given the evolution of email and calendaring offerings since DEE 1.0 was implemented in 2012, DISA is interested in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>exploring all available options, including cloud technologies to offer lower-cost, highly-available services to the DoD community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DoD security policies have evolved and expanded the possible hosting options to deliver cloud-based email services (DEE 2.0) to the DoD community. These range from the current DoD on-premise approach to a commercial vendor-premise deployment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We realize that each hosting approach is associated with a number of planning, technical, and contracting considerations and we solicit vendor feedback and recommendations on approaches that would maximize effectiveness and cost efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Below are examples of two (2) cloud-based email deployment approaches which will be considered as possible alternatives to DEE 1.0.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While we recognize that shared cloud environments may provide significant opportunities, they also present unique risks to DoD data and systems that must be addressed.</p>

Contact Center Solution for Department of Veterans Affairs
Request for Information (RFI)

Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.
 
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors, who are able to meet Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for a Contact Center solution that provides Tier 1 support for Veterans.   Any contract/order that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 541512. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is $27.5M. Please indicate your company size and socio-economic status under this NAICS.

Scope of Work

VA is seeking information regarding established/existing Contact Centers capable of providing Tier 1 support to Veterans with proven industry and/or federal experience in successfully managing the over 20 million calls per year anticipated by VA.  The Contractor s Contact Center solution must be established and operational within 50 days of award and is required to be an onshore (domestic) service provider delivering the customer experience, journeys and engagement life cycle to the Veterans through trained, empathetic call center agents.  Calls received will be logged into the Call Center s contact center system, and triaged/handed-off to established Tier 2 and Tier 3 VA Call Centers and facilities.  

Contact Center Solution Capabilities:
24x7x365 Support
Scalability to support 20 million calls (or more!) per year
Empathetic agents trained to accurately respond, log and triage
Capability to answer and log calls that do not require the deep experience of Tier 2/3 VA Call Center agents 
Multi-Channel Capability   email, text and chat
High Service Quality
Call Analytics services
Dedicated Phone Number and Mailbox
High First Call Resolution and Customer Experience Index
Uses digital labor and contact center automation
Integrated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) services
Data Analytics services
Support contacts via a range of mobile devices
Knowledge Management services
Tier 0 Self Service portal services

The Contractor is expected  to use its own robust telephony (inclusive of voice and interactive voice response services), as well as offer customer services through channels such as email response management, SMS, text services and mobile applications, to meet VA s Contact Center requirements. Due to the widely varying demographics, potential physical limitations, and diverse range of possible issues Veterans may present, VA requires a robust multi/omni channel capability that leverages leading technologies which deliver excellent customer experience at the best value. This will appropriately enable Veterans to select the appropriate interaction channel, and maximize the use of digital labor, process and cognitive automation, etc.  An example would be the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated with chat that can provide automated answers to a percentage of Veteran questions but escalate to a live agent if required. VA also requires that all interactions, regardless of entry channel or degree of human interaction, be captured for data analytics. VA will supply the Tier 1 Contact Center agents with the appropriate business knowledge via training and knowledge articles. The Contractor implementation team may be asked to assist VA in identifying and documenting the appropriate workflows and interface protocol between the Contractor-provided Tier 1 Contact Center and the VA Tier 2 or Tier 3 Call Centers or facilities. The Contact Center solution shall utilize human-centered design (including prototyping and testing solutions with Veterans before launch, and/or Veteran journeys to design the solution) throughout the implementation.  VA s anticipated performance metrics will include, but not be limited to, first call resolution (FCR), Customer Experience Index (CXI), Average Speed To Answer, Abandonment Rate (Number of callers that hang up before an agent answers), Accuracy of Call Forecasting (difference between the number of calls predicted to arrive during a specific timeframe and the actual number of calls that arrived).
VA currently anticipates the following period of performance: 12 months from the date of award, with 4 optional performance years.

The D3I Domain 1 is a Multiple-Award IDIQ contract vehicle procured through full and open competition (utilizing FAR Part 15 procedures), and provides for a total potential program ceiling value of $3.038B to be share among all awardees. Each awarded contract carries a 5-year base ordering period and two consecutive 2-year optional ordering periods within which specific Domain 1 task order requirements will be competed among the eight awardees.</p>

<p>The maximum value, as stated above, is a collective ceiling that will be shared among all MAIDIQ awardees across all contracts and task orders awarded. The contracts include contract line items types cost plus fixed-fee, cost plus incentive fee, firm fixed price, and fixed price incentive firm target.</p>
