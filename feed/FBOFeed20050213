<DESC>USAID/IRAQ is seeking applications from US and TCN citizens interested in the position of Agriculture Advisor (GS-14) under a Personal Services Contract (PSC).  Subject to funds availability, contract will be for one year, with an option to extend for one more year. Position will be based in Baghdad, Iraq. 

Iraq's agriculture has been slowly but inexorably deteriorating over the past two decades.  Since 2003, USAID has been providing assistance to help reshape Iraq’s agricultural institutions, systems, processes and capacity into an effective and productive sector.  This assistance has the immediate objective of assisting the Government of Iraq to prioritize, plan for and tackle immediate issues in the sector to help stabilize Iraqi agriculture and create employment. It also has the longer term goal of creating an economically efficient, productive, employment-generating and market-oriented agricultural sector. 

USAID's Agriculture program (ARDI) is but one small part of USAID's larger efforts for the economic reform.  USAID's office of Private Sector Development has three major multiyear contracts and a number of smaller ones that work closely together to provide technical services, finance and support to deal with most of the key constraints to the revitalization of the private sector in Iraq and the reform of the government. The agricultural program, ARDI, is a national program, which is working in every one of Iraq's governorates on a long term development agenda for the reform and rehabilitation of the agricultural sector.  This program includes policy level reform activities, sub-sector national programs and quick impact actions.  The day to day management of the entire program is very closely coordinated with the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Interim Iraqi Government’s own investments and actions in the sector.  At this time, the program is assisting the MOA to provide modern extension advice, testing modern production technologies, whilst encouraging the growth of private sector suppliers of modern inputs, and establishing workshops rehabilitating agricultural machinery.  Other planned activities include work on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that impact on trade in the agriculture sector such as ISO 9000 and HACCP training, the re-establishment and re-equipping of the quarantine stations at the borders, cold chain management, providing grants for processing improvements, improving access to rural credit, land leveling and soil testing.  On the policy side, ARDI has a two year program laid out that continues work on the re-organization of the MOA institutional structures and building the staff capacity to operate in a liberalized economy.
