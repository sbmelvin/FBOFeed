<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotation number is N62645-02-T-0002.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-01 are incorporated.  NAICS 325413/SIC 2835.  The Navy intends to negotiate with Microgenics Corporation, Freman, CA as the only source that can provide the following immunoassay reagent for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for use in the DoD Military Drug Testing Laboratories.  The resulting contract will be a requirements type contract with a base year and five option years.  The estimated quantity of test kits per year is 360.  SOW.  C.1.  REQUIREMENTS FOR IMMUNOASSAY TEST REAGENT FOR LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE.  C.1.1  The materials shall be for the immunological reagent for initial (screen) testing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in urine.  The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics of sensitivity and specificity for detection of LSD and its metabolites in urine as the current immunoassay for LSD employed in the military laboratories.  The reagent must be compatible for use with the Roche-Hitachi Modular automated chemical analyzer system, specifically with the P module and/or the DDP for optimal throughput of sample testing on the Modular system. The reagent must be applicable without modification of the Modular system beyond establishment of operational parameters.  The reagent must not interfere with the optimum performance of other immunoassay procedures performed on the Modular system.  C.1.2  Sensitivity and Specificity.  The reagent shall be used for the identification of LSD and its metabolites in physiological urine specimens.  The reagent must provide equivalent or better performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity for detection of LSD and its metabolites in urine as the current LSD immunoassay screening procedure used in the military laboratories.  Recognizing that physiologic urine specimens from LSD drug ingestion may contain other metabolites of LSD or iso-LSD, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay should maximize the antibody cross-reactivity for LSD and iso-LSD and their metabolites, such as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD.  The assay must not cross-react with other drugs or metabolites listed in the table below.  DoD laboratory certified solutions of pure LSD at a concentration of 500 pg/ml will be used for calibration of the Roche-Hitachi Modular system.  However, the reagent must perform such that in actual physiological urine specimens containing 150 - 175 pg/ml of LSD (as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in the presence of the various other metabolites from LSD ingestion found in urine, will show an apparent concentration of 500 pg/ml total LSD metabolic products by the reagent immunoassay procedure.  While LSD is the principal compound for LSD detection, sensitivity to the presence of iso-LSD is required. Sensitivity to LSD and iso-LSD should be maximized.  The testing reagent must detect 90% of all quality control specimens containing pure LSD or iso-LSD at concentrations equal to or greater than 135% of the DoD cutoff concentration of 500 pg/ml.  The LSD testing reagent must also maintain reproducibility in quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) measurements.  The following drug cutoffs in urine specimens are currently used by the DoD for the initial immunoassay and GC/MS confirmation tests. Drug/Metabolite; Cutoff in ng/mL, Initial test, GC/MS.  11 Nor delta 9 THC carboxylic acid (THCCOOH), 50, 15; Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine), 150, 100; Opiates (Morphine), 2000, morphine 4000, codeine 2000; Phencyclidine (PCP),25, 25, Amphetamine/ Methamphetamine (amphetamines), 500, 500; Barbiturates (secobarbital), 200, 200; Lysergic

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) intends to award a sole source procurement to SUN Microsystems, Inc. NIMA has a requirement for the purchase of an E6500 server.  The E6500 server was installed by SUN Microsystems at a NIMA facility under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).  As part of this CRADA SUN engineers worked with NIMA to fine tune all the hardware and operating software parameters to achieve maximum performance for the application.  The CRADA has now ended and NIMA needs to purchase the server.  Removing the computer and replacing it with another would cause schedule delays to the developer and associated costs to the government. SUN Microsystems, Inc. is the only known source that could meet the requirements of this purchase. This is a synopsis of intent to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the product. All responses must be e-mailed to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Attn:  Christina S., stanscc@nima.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 3 January 2002. It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-mails have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>Additional Q&As

1.	The subject solicitation stipulates a 10-page limitation on the offeror?s proposal.  My question is: is a font size of 10 acceptable, or must it be a font size of 12?

Answer: 12 

2.	Does the electronic version of the proposal need to be limited to 10 pages?

Answer:  The technical proposal when printed out must not exceed 10 pages.

3.	What is the definition of a small business for purposes of this solicitation?  Is it a certain amount of receipts per year for the company?  If so, what is the amount?  There is a mention of a Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.  Is this the threshold of the project award amount, or is it the threshold of the amount of annual receipts of the company that is to be considered a small business for purposes of this solicitation?

Answer: The Simplified Acquisition Threshold is $100,000.  The Government estimates that the cost of this effort will be under this threshold of $100,000 therefore this procurement has to be reserved for small business.  The Government defines a small business for this procurement using the NAICS code 541512 and the size standard of $18 million a year.

4.	We need clarification on exactly how many groups and interviews to bid on.  And are the ?interviews? also one-on-ones at a facility using a computer, or are they telephone interviews, or some other type of interview?

Answer:  This deliverable is stated very clearly in the Statement of Work.  Please see Deliverable B under Task 2 Interim Redesign.  The bidder should determine how best to conduct these interviews and submit this as part of their proposal.

5.	Does the administering authority of FirstGov employ a current set of usability metrics, e.g.., accessibility, form use, performance, maintainability, ease of navigation, readability, etc.?

Answer: Yes, some.

Should the bidder examine and incorporate these measures as protocols for this project?  If so, what method may a prospective bidder use to access the current usability metrics?

Answer: This should be referenced as a step the bidder will take however it is not necessary that each protocol is addressed specifically in the proposal.

6.	What is the purpose of conducting Focus Groups?  To establish a graphical direction for your site, or are you thinking you will be able to drive requirements for future redesign from this data?

Answer:  To establish a graphical direction, improve the information architecture, and to drive future designs.

Is an alternative to Focus Group testing acceptable as an alternative in our proposal, as long as it meets the requirement for obtaining needed information about your users?

Answer: Yes.


7.	Given that the period of performance is now specified as 6 months, do you still expect that the bidder?s ?project leader? will be engaged full-time on this project during that 6 month period of performance?

Answer:  There should not be more than one project leader assigned to FirstGov.  This is important for consistency of project management.  There will be some time when the project leader will be working full time with FirstGov but we don?t anticipate that this will be for the duration of the project.  There should be one point of contact (the project leader) with the contractor.  We understand that other individuals may be assigned to handle certain aspects of the project, however project management tasks should be handled by the project leader.

<DESC>Questions about the solicitation for Focus Group/Usability Tests and Interim Redesign of FirstGov.gov

We received many questions about this solicitation. We have condensed some of the questions, eliminated redundant questions, and put what was left into categories. 

Proposal Submission Date

There are two submission dates in the requirement, 12/19 and 12/21. What is the correct date you want the submission of the response?

The two submission dates of 12/19 and 12/21 was an error that was corrected by Modification 1 to this solicitation.  Modification 1 made it clear that the correct submission date was 12/21.  However, GSA has decided to extend the date for receipt of proposals from 12/21/01 to a new date of 12/28/01 by 3:00 pm, EST.  Electronic submission (e-mail) of proposal is preferred.  The e-mail address is Michael.Jackson@gsa.gov.  However, if an offeror does not possess e-mail capability, please send the hard copy of the proposal to Michael O. Jackson/MVF, General Services Administration, Office of Acquisition Policy, 1800 F Street, Room 4006, Washington, DC, 20405.  The hard copy of the proposal must reach Mr. Jackson by 3:00 pm, EST, December 28, 2001.     

Are you expecting actual proposal responses to this presolicitation notice by 12/21/2001, or will there be an actual RFP (etc.) released?  If an RFP is forthcoming, when do you anticipate its release?

Proposals are due by 12/28/01, 3:00pm, EST. The requirement was published as a ?combined synopsis/solicitation?; therefore the notice constitutes the solicitation also.

Award Date

When is the estimated award date?

	January 2002

Deadline for Questions

Is there a deadline for submitting questions?

The deadline for submission of questions is 3:00 pm, EST, Wednesday, December 19, 2001.

Contract Duration

What are your desired completion dates for each of the two major project tasks: 1) Focus Group/Usability Tests, 2) Interim Redesign of FirstGov.gov?

The performance period in the combined synopsis/solicitation notice is modified as follows:

Work on the focus group and usability tests and the attendant report and recommendations must be completed 60 days after award of the contract.  Preliminary design plans must be submitted within 90 days after the award. Work on the redesign plan must be completed within 6 months after the award.

Contract Process and Management

Are services required to be performed on site full time or will point of contact via the project manager suffice?

The contractor should propose the strategy he/she feels most appropriate to meet all of the Government?s requirements.        

Although the link to the FAR is a dead link, we did find the Reps and
Certs.  Are there any other business proposal instructions that we should be aware of?

See various Q&As throughout this modification.

Do you want the proposal delivered in paper or electronically? If paper, how many copies? If electronically, will Word and Excel work?  File size limitations?

Proposal should be delivered electronically in a Microsoft Word document. Microsoft Excel is also acceptable.   Printed, hard copy of technical proposal cannot exceed ten pages.  This ten-page limitation does not include attachments for resumes and past performance.  Each offeror is requested to provide three past performance references for similar work.  As well as a brief summary of each reference, please provide names and current phone numbers for each of the three past performance references.  There is no page limitation for the price proposal.

What is the expected level of participation of FirstGov staff?  Specifically, how many resources, what general skills, and what time commitment can we expect to support joint project tasks?

Full participation from project leader, with other resources and skills as needed.

What is the decision process for a contract award (oral presentations, reference demonstrations, etc.)?

There are no oral prese

<DESC>Are there any points of the test plan that the government has already identified (mission critical or otherwise) that are to be included in this plan? 

Yes. See next answer.

If yes, can this information be made available to prospective offerors/bidders prior to bid submission deadline with enough time allowed to incorporate into a responsive proposal?

This information will be made available at the time of the award.

Has the government received feedback to clearly identify areas in the problem statement, which will be required to be addressed during the performance period? 

Yes, but the information is not sufficient. See next answer.

If so, can the government provide a copy or statement of problems, which have already been identified and will most likely be included in the test plan.

No.  The awardee will help categorize and rank the issues or opportunities we have identified and help identify others.

Whose responsibility is payment of participant incentives, the government, or the contractors, since the contract is being awarded as a ?firm fixed price? this is an important element?

Participants can be volunteers.  Otherwise, participant incentives are at the expense of the contractor, which are part of the contract costs.

Can the costs associated with recruitment (facilities are already at government expense) and participant incentives, be modified (in the contract) to become direct costs, which are then paid by the contract, then billed to the government as a direct cost to the contract?

All costs associated with performance should be in the price proposal.

There are three primary customers they list - citizens, businesses, and governments.  Are there any further specifications around these customers (e.g. governments to include state, city, county governments, or for citizens to include all or only those who are online experienced?)

Participants -- government employees from all levels of government and citizens must be computer literate, and all must have at least a small amount of experience online.

Under Task 1 and later under Deliverable it says "up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews". Does this really mean up to three focus groups and four sets of one-on-one usability tests-one for each stakeholder group? This make more sense for what is typically done in usability testing.

No. We expect three focus groups and/or group usability sessions, up to three one-on-one usability tests, as well as four interviews with stakeholders. 

Are there key finds you?re looking for through usability testing?

Yes, what the consumer market wants and needs.

Are we correct in assuming that these stakeholders are government employees who would participate as part of their job, and thus there would be no need to recruit them or compensate them for there time? 

We expect to use a few government employees, but contractors should expect to recruit from the appropriate levels of government.  They will not have to be compensated if tests are done during workday hours.

Should the cost portion of a submitted response include the cost of participant incentives?

Yes, however, some of the participants can be volunteers, such as government employees.

What stakeholders are anticipated to be participants in the in-depth 
interviews?

	We will provide this guidance at the time of the contract award.

The solicitation specifies 3 usability tests; we assume that each test will be with one of the three audiences outlined in the statement of work--consumers, business, and government audiences. Is this correct? Are "government" audiences defined simply as individuals who work for the Federal government in some capacity?

The three audiences are correct. The contractor can mix audiences in the sessions. Government employees can be local, state, federal, or tribal employees.

In what ways is the California site judged to be superior? Is this

<DESC>DESC: CONTRACT RESPONSE DATED CORRECTED TO SHOW 07 FEB 2002. FINAL NOTICE:  This is an 100% HUBZone Set-Aside Competitive Procurement and is opened to HUBZone firms only.  It consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposer(s) whose proposal(s), conforming to the Request for Proposal(s), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other facts considered.    AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THE ONE SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  ADDITIONALLY, IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.  THEREFORE, THE OFFEROR'S INITIAL PROPOSAL SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFEROR'S BEST TERMS FROM A COST OR PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor(s).  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, design-build for new construction, renovation/revitalization/alteration and repair and associated work at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.  Types of work/projects may include, but is not limited to:  administrative and industrial facilities, whole house revitalization, child care centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional building construction, manufacturing and industrial building construction, and other similar facilities.  In support of design-build strategies, each offeror shall employ the services of an architect/engineering design firm experienced in the coordination of multi-discipline architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of new and renovation of various types of facilities.  The Government shall not coordinate the work for the Contractor.  Offerors may offer multiple lead design firms to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  The Offeror and the Lead Design Firm(s) proposed for the basic contract will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A/Es), their subsidiaries and affiliates that were involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project may not be proposed or used on a task order for that project.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, and may be competed on the basis of price, best value, or technically acceptable low price.  Task orders may be performance oriented requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both.  Task orders may not have traditional plans and specifications, but may include sketches, and request for catalog cuts, and other submittals.  In order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work, the salient requirements of the task order, will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task order with a specific completion date.   Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order.  If a contractor selects not to attend a site visit and submit a proposal, the contractor shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer within two days, of receipt of either a written oral scope of work.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation fall

<DESC>NA SOURCES SOUGHT/MARKET SURVEY.  The USA Intelligence and Security Command, Fort Belvoir, VA is seeking industry sources for a potential acquisition to provide the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Signal Analysis Laboratory (SAL) with full digital processing capability commensurate with the modern frequency agile, low-probability-of intercept signals and other advances in modern radars.  Input to this sources sought announcement will aid the government in establishing the acquisition plan and determ ining whether or not the requirement will be set-aside for small business.    All interested parties (large and small businesses) are encouraged to submit a capability statement (limit 4 pages) in response to this inquiry.  The capability statement must ad dress the specialized experience identified in the Statement of Work below.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  1.0  SCOPE - Support services provided under this contract include requirements analysis, market research, design, purchase, integration, installation, and tra ining of test, measurement, and analysis equipment to provide the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Signal Analysis Laboratory (SAL) with full digital processing capability commensurate with modern frequency agile, low-probability-of-intercept sig nals, and other advances in modern radars. 1.1 Background - The Radar and Air Defense Division at the NGIC (IANG-GS-RA) performs analysis of electromagnetic signals.  In order to accomplish this mission, the SAL requires test, measurement, and analysis equ ipment, software, and equipment control capability, in order to quickly, efficiently and accurately analyze complex modern radar emissions recorded with state-of-the-art methods, and produce quality technical intelligence products.  In the majority, the in telligence community is evolving from analog laboratory equipment to digital equipment laboratories.  NGIC's laboratory currently consists of primarily analog equipment and community-developed software for ELINT analysis resident on UNIX workstations.  NGI C has acquired the Apcom LOOKING GLASS, ADR 3850 receiver system, SAM-450, Celerity Gigastore and the STL 1010 Digital Switch as the first step in the evolution toward full digital signals processing compatibility. The efforts detailed herein are intended to expand on this base to achieve full analog and digital integration of the SAL. 1.2 Tasking - The Contractor shall continue the transition of NGIC from their largely analog oriented analysis lab to a modern digital/analog analysis lab, utilizing the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) Navy Electronic Signal Analysis Laboratory (NESAL) as a template.  The Contractor shall make use of previous studies, provided by NGIC, ONI, and other Agencies, which identified specific equipment, the integration of that equipment, and detailed the architecture that will permit NGIC to accomplish its anal ysis tasks.   The Contractor shall install all digital signal processing equipment purchased in accordance with the tasks identified in section 1.2.1 (TASK 1.3, equipment is identified in the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)), develop or re-util ize equipment control software for controlling identified or future pieces of equipment, complete the integration of existing equipment with the new digital system, and evaluate expanded equipment and software needs, as needed. This installation/integratio n shall include the capability to program any input device to any output device up to the capacity of the STL Digital Switch (Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)), if such connection is available.  The installation shall include the fabrication or purchas e of all necessary cables (GFE) and pin-out tables for all equipment identified in the IGCE and any other available peripheral equipment deemed necessary to provide a full digital processing and analysis capability.  It is anticipated that the Contractor s hall provide off-the-shelf hardware and software items inciden

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for preparation of working drawings and specifications, cost estimate, submittal review and other construction period services for Project Number 528-704, Construct Addition for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Unit at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY.  The purpose of the project is to provide a permanent on-site Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) suite.  This project will involve the construction of an additional floor to accommodate the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) suite. The addition will be placed over an area that was built in 1984 and structurally designed to support two more floor levels. The design will try to comply as much as possible with the goal to align the functionality of services, placing the MRI unit adjacent to the area below the Imaging Department, which is located on the 3rd floor. The construction will meet all applicable Patient Privacy/UFAS/H-08-09 space planning standard/criteria, and will comply with the MRI VA Design Guide. The exception to the recommendations will be that the unit will not be built in the Imaging suite or on the same floor, but below it in order to provide as much staff efficiency as possible.  The design entails evaluating the existing areas that adjoin the future MRI suite and determining the optimal way of tying into the space in terms of cost, impact on existing activities and functionality. The designer shall perform a structural analysis to ensure the capability of the existing building to support the new construction and MRI equipment. The VA will inform the designer of the intended make and model of the MRI equipment as soon as possible so as to allow compliance with any specific requirements. This will occur after award of the design contract. The designer will evaluate the electrical power (and other utility) requirements and include all necessary construction to bring necessary utilities to the addition.  The project will include providing all telephone and computer network infrastructure required and affected by the construction.  Drawings will be CADD generated with Auto Cad 14.  Specifications shall be compiled from VA master specifications which are available on the internet.  Selection of the Architect/Engineer will be based on specialized experience, capability of the firm to perform, professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project, past performance for VA work and/or similar hospital projects, and the record of past performance in the form of a comparison between their estimates and actual project awards.  The area of consideration is restricted to firms within a 165 mile radius of the medical center.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted on Standard Forms 254 and 255 no later than January 22, 2002. Submission should emphasize experience on similar projects.  This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 54131 applies.  Construction cost estimate is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.
