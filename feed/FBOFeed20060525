<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR).   For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.   The web site address is www.mms.gov/tarphome.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting White Papers.     BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research sponsored by the MMS through the TA&R Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico and the and ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability, as well as alternative countermeasures, including chemical dispersants, in situ burning and viscous oil pumping.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to the MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals will be requested.  Projects selected for eventual funding by the MMS shall receive funding from FY 2007 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $500,000 to $800,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2007, with projects being identified through this announcement. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require up to one man-year effort and cost up to $250,000.  Prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE: The MMS may share the White Paper submissions with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the White Paper shared outside the MMS.  The MMS anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a firm fixed-price basis.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK Repair Eroded Banks with Concrete Blocks Kooskia National Fish Hatchery A recent (4/6/2006) high water event caused severe erosion around two hatchery structures. Hatchery intake and dam wall:  High water eroded the riprap which provides access to the intake structure and protects the hatchery intake pipeline. Hatchery weir and Trap:  High water undermined protective rock gabions, causing them to fall into the creek below the hatchery weir, flooding the trap area. Failure to repair the erosion will result in instability of the bank protecting the hatchery pipeline, which will threaten the pipeline and hatchery water supply.  Failure to remove and replace the gabions below the weir will result in continued erosion of the bank.  Also, leaving the gabions in the creek channel will cause the water to back up during high water and flood the fish trap area.  Eco-block: A concrete block approximately 2x2x6ft weighing approximately 4000 lbs.  These blocks are stackable and have an attachment at the top for being lifted into place. Replacement of the existing damaged structures with Eco Blocks is recommended.   At the intake site a single row of block approximately 80 ft long will be needed.  At the weir site a row 80 ft long and stacked two high will be needed.  Excavating will be required to remove the old gabions, level up the eco blocks, and to backfill in behind the new eco blocks. Work will be performed at Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, which lies 2 miles up the Clear Creek County road.  The hatchery has clear access to both worksites.  Work will be performed during low water as equipment will have to enter the creek bed.  Low water generally occurs between July 15 and August 30. No material will be left along the banks (other than backfilling the blocks) or in the creek bed, at the jobs conclusion.  In order to remain compliant with the permit exemption, the original scope of the original structures that were in place shall not be exceeded. Work will be conducted under a permit exemption which allows Kooskia Fish Hatchery to work on or replace existing damaged structures. Kooskia NFH office hours are M-F 7:30am to 4:00pm.  If work needs to extend beyond those hours, arrangement will be made.  Technical Coordinator: Adam Izbicki or Gerald Fogleman (208) 926-4272.  Solicitation numer 101816Q317 may be viewed thru a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or http://www.nbc.gov".  The solicitation response date will be approximately 15 days from posting date.  No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.

Gravel fill will be installed to bring the site to designed grades before rock is placed.  Native rock from the existing gravel bars will be installed on the paved rock to create a more ‘natural’ stream channel.  Willow poles will be incorporated into the riprap to create shade and diversity in the channel.  Willow stakes will be driven into the bank of the channel opposite of the riprap to create shade and diversity of the channel bank.
 
The site will require de-watering prior to installation of the rock.  The project sponsor has obtained land rights and New York DEC permits that must be followed.  Access, stockpile and staging areas are outlined in the drawings or marked in the field.  The contractor is responsible for all aspects of the construction of this project including providing and placing necessary fill, rock riprap and willow planting materials.  Seeding will be completed by others.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to award a five-year contract to continue the operation and further development of the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC).  This is a full and open procurement to operate the Clearinghouse, and it is open to all responsible sources.  The Clearinghouse promotes informed education decision- making through a set of easily accessible, searchable databases and user-friendly reports that provide education consumers with high-quality reviews of the effectiveness of replicable educational interventions (programs, products, practices, and policies) that are intended to improve student achievement (www.whatworks.ed.gov).

The new Clearinghouse will continue some of the features that began under the original contract, including: completing systematic reviews of evidence-based research on effective interventions in elementary school math, beginning reading, early childhood education, and dropout prevention that are currently underway, and producing evidence reports on those reviews; updating evidence standards and criteria for conducting systematic reviews on an as-needed basis; and developing and maintaining the registry of outcome evaluators and the WWC Help Desk.  New tasks to be developed and implemented under this new contract include: developing and maintaining searchable databases of registries of education interventions, and randomized control trials of education interventions; cost-of-implementation analyses; a streamlined, fast-response systematic review process; evidence standards, rating criteria and a systematic review of the best available evidence when rigorous research is lacking, a directory of easy answers to technical issues; 48-hour turnaround reviews of individual studies; and, validation studies on study author's original data submissions.  

The Request for Proposals will be released on this website on or about June 19, 2006.

Interested sources (primes or subcontractors) who have not previously responded should respond to this announcement.  Additionally, interested sources should request access to this information through the established website.  See paragraph entitled, “RFP ACCESS”.   

System Description: The MUE Program is the User Segment component of the GPS modernization effort.  The objective of the MUE Program is to demonstrate the “proof of existence” of MUE by demonstrating the ability to develop MUE receiver card designs, certify them under PRONAV, demonstrate their compliance with the MUE TRD, and ability to develop PVT data using the M-Code signal. To demonstrate this ability the MUE Program seeks to let contracts to design, develop, fabricate, and document two YMCA receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground-based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI).  These requirements are available at the GPS website.  Instructions on how to access this website are presented at the end of this announcement.  The receiver cards will demonstrate the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) security architecture.  Support for demonstration of MUE receiver cards is covered under this effort.    

The MUE Receiver Program does not include production.  It is anticipated that MUE receiver card procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service-wide needs.
To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following program objectives are provided as reference:
  
1.	Design, develop, test, and document a YMCA compliant GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI, ensuring the receiver cards meet the requirements specified by the MUE TRD and other applicable requirements documents.   
2.	Implement a design for the receiver cards that optimizes performance, security, and safety, while allowing for the flexibility of the design to support emerging requirements/applications and minimizing the recurring costs of future YMCA receiver production.
3.	Deliver government approved consolidated MUE Receiver Card Test Plans and procedures for the integration, functional, software, and security testing of both receiver cards.
4.	Verify both receiver cards meet performance, environmental, security, and safety requirements, in accordance with Government-approved contractor MUE Receiver Card Test Plans, MUE Security Certification Plan and MUE TRD.

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balance aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including P-100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service). As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - The project requires renovations and additions to the 1933 U.S. Post Office/Courthouse/Custom House, located at 413 Middle Street, New Bern, NC 28360-0000. The PO-CT-CH is located in the New Bern Central Business District.  This district is located within the historical district of New Bern, North Carolina.  It is a three-story Georgian Revival style building clad with red brick veneer (laid in common bond) with limestone trim and a granite base.  The steeply pitched roof is slate with copper-clad arched dormers at each end and a four-story wood cupola, painted white.  The PO-CT-CH is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The site is nearly level, elevated slightly above the street grade allowing drainage to the street. It is approximately 1.20 acres.  To the rear of the building there is an asphalt paved parking area (13 assigned spaces of the 53 total outside spaces) and loading dock.

The project proposes a complete renovation, alteration, and additions to the building in a manner sensitive to the historic nature and fabric of the building.  The program is to maximize the building’s capacity to function strictly as a court facility and provide for the 30-year needs of the court.  The project includes restoration of facade, improving ADA access, landscaping, roof repair, and building additions.  There are also requirements to: restore, repair and provide for blast protection at courtroom windows; install a new sprinkler system, fire alarm, exit signage and emergency lighting; abate and remove hazardous materials; replace the existing elevator, add two new elevators; and upgrade the HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems with a focus on reducing energy consumption.  Historic interiors will be restored, and major portions of tenant-inhabited space will be rebuilt to meet the customers’ requirements.

This project will provide superior workplaces for civilian federal employees, and shall serve as an example of successful historic preservation while making a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building. The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements. GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager Services.  The Construction Manager will be an active participant in the design process to provide (in addition to the A/E):  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality, including energy efficiency, and constructability reviews.

SCOPE OF WORK - The facility will be designed using English units of measurement.  The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for clear and concise communication of the design intent to contractors who will construct the work.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  design development drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design (CAD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the renovations and alterations to the existing building and related systems, site development and parking, client program requirements, and sustainable, energy-saving features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The design is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; EPACT 2005 compliance; P100 (Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Service); adherence to the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U.S. Marshals design requirements and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design.  The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format with a requirement for Certification and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.

This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106. Design submissions will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed. Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the buildings restoration or preservation zones identified in the BPP. Alteration or removal of original materials and design requires special justification and a Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO. The selected A/E firm will assist GSA in obtaining any required MOA’s.

Eligible firms will be invited to bid to provide office supplies (stationery items) to JFC Naples.

This project has a yearly value of $111,000 USD (Euro 87,000) and a potential value of $444,000 USD (1 base year + 4 one-year options). The reference for this project is ACO-NAP-06-16 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference.

ELIGIBILITY

Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to bid will be added to an electronic distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is issued, those firms will be notified electronically and will be instructed to download the tender documents on the following website: 

http://www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/ifib/index.htm

<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 360873459011   Sarah_Welch@nps.gov; Eric Walkinshaw Project Manager 36056922112166 eric_walkinshaw@nps.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The work of this contract is operation of a Visitor Transportation System (VTS) serving the Paradise area of Mount Rainier National Park.  The Contractor shall operate shuttles over an NPS approved and designated operating route and route schedules, with an emphasis on safety.   The Contractor shall furnish all fuel, resources, equipment, supplies, vehicles and personnel required to provide the required services.  The primary purpose of the VTS is to provide safe and convenient  transportation for visitors seeking to enjoy the Paradise area but are unable to find parking in designated parking lots.  Most visitors arrive at Paradise by private auto and this area frequently experiences levels of demand that exceeds the capacity of designated parking areas adjacent to the Jackson Visitor Center (JVC) and the Paradise Inn.  The shortfall in parking is particularly acute on sunny weekends and holidays as residents of nearby Seattle and Tacoma are drawn to the mountain which can be seen along the eastern horizon.  This imbalance between demand and parking capacity is expected to worsen as the Park begins construction of a new visitor center and rehabilitation of the historic Paradise Inn in 2006 and continues during the 2007 and 2008 seasons.  Construction staging and other activities are expected to reduce the number of designated parking spaces from approximately 750 to 300, a reduction of approximately 60 percent (450 spaces).  Information and maps of Mount Rainier National Park can be found at http://www.nps.gov/mora . DETAILS:  This commercial item solicitation is open to all sources (full and open competition), NAICS 485999, Shuttle services (except employee bus).  The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.  Request for Proposals #N9450060063 will be posted on the Department of Interior electronic commerce website (http://ideasec.nbc.gov) on approximately May 30, 2006.  Offers will be due on June 20, and we hope to award a contract and begin shuttle service as quickly as possible.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), requires the services of a contractor to continue the operation of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) to acquire, maintain and distribute wild-type and mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and related nematode species, to characterize these strains, and to stimulate research using C. elegans as a model system.  The CGC is expected to provide a genetic resource to investigators using C. elegans as a model in biological research.  The CGC currently contains approximately 7000 strains that must be maintained on an on-going basis. Approximately 800-1000 strains of C. elegans shall be acquired each year from collaborating laboratories.  Acquisitions shall be subcultured, cleaned of contaminants, stored as frozen replicates, and, if necessary, as active stocks. Some of the other tasks include conducting yearly survival tests on a limited number of frozen strains to ensure that long-term storage of strains does not result in strain loss, testing potentially advantageous new methods for strain storage and/or distribution as needed to ensure the survival of strains, and maintaining the current computer-based storage and retrieval system which contains all relevant data about the collection.  It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about June 1, 2007. The solicitation will be available electronically on or about June 9, 2006 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. under the NHLBI posting section.    Proposals will be due on or about August 11, 2006.  Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.    This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for two laser distance transducers for measurement of helicopter blade motions in the Army NASA RASCAL JUH-60. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Keyence Corporation of America located in Pleasanton, California, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1), only one source reasonably available that can meet Agency requirements.  The required sensors are direct replacements for the original set operated in the RASCAL JUH-60 helicopter. The most critical requirements for determining suitable replacements are the nominal focal distance, distance sensing ranges of operation, distance resolution, linearity, measurement update rate, and sensor weight and size.  These quantities are determined by the physical geometry of the UH-60 rotor system and the existing customer sensor mounting hardware, and the measurement accuracy requirements for the system in both space and time.  The sensors must be able to operate reliably and maintain their performance in the severe vibration and loading environment of the UH-60 rotor hub throughout the flight envelope of the UH-60 helicopter.  In addition, it is also essential that the replacement sensor be “Class 3b” or eye-safe.   Specific requirements for the type 1 laser displacement sensor are as follows:	Reference Distance 100mm, Measuring Range +/- 40mm, Linearity &lt;= 1.6% of F.S.^1, Resolution 40um @ 20ms, Frequency Response 18Hz @ 20ms, Maximum size (sensor head) 46^3x45.5x17mm, Maximum size (controller) 138x55x30mm, Maximum weight (sensor head) 165g, Maximum weight (controller) 155g.  Specific requirements for the Type 2 laser displacement Sensor are as follows:  Reference Distance 300mm, Measuring Range +/- 100mm, Linearity &lt;= 4% of F.S., Resolution 50um @ 20ms, Frequency Response 36Hz @ 10ms, Maximum size (sensor head) 56^3x85x28mm, Maximum size (controller) 110x90x83mm, Maximum weight (sensor head) 250g, Maximum weight (controller) 530g.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 8, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.  Each contract will also include additional optional quantity labor hours in the amount of 22,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base period and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours each one of the option periods for a total of 190,000 labor hours for each contract.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This requirement is not a   follow on effort.  The RFP will be issued approximately on April 26, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date. The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  The Government is obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.

<DESC>NASA plans to issue a non-competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to ATK Thiokol Inc., ATK Launch Systems Group for the completion of qualification and the production of Space Shuttle’s Booster Separation Motors (BSM’s) required for the remainder of the Space Shuttle Program.  No other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.   NASA/MSFC intends to acquire these services non-competitively from ATK pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  The continuous availability and reliability of booster separation motors is essential for operation of the Space Shuttle.  The initial cost impacts associated with any new vendor are deemed prohibitive, and time will not permit a development and qualification program and still support the required Shuttle launch schedule.   The RFP will be released on or about June 8, 2006.  A firm date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  Notification of interest and capability to respond to this requirement or to submit proposals in response to this synopsis should be provided to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the date this synopsis is posted. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 22 and 26. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>ERIC VOKT, 435-831-2107
<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with ITT Advanced Engineering & Sciences, 5901 Indian School Rd. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87110 to fabricate and deliver one Raman-shifted Eye-safe Aerosol LIDAR version 2 (REAL v2+) system within a mobile platfor m suitable for both highway and desert road transportation.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, supplies, services, and/or equipment required are available from one responsible source and no other type of supplie s, services, and/or equipment will satisfy agency requirements due to the following:  (1) unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities; and (2)  the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.  The REAL v2+ will provide new capabilitie s to the chemical biological test community.  Emitting high-energy, near-infrared (NIR), eye-safe laser pulses, the REAL v2+ provides a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting in long-range detection while providing 3-m range resolution.  That far excee ds the current 100-m range resolution of the existing eye-safe elastic-backscatter LIDAR system at DPG.  The REAL also exceeds the range of the other DPG non-eye-safe elastic-backscatter LIDAR.  Research and development of the REAL has been ongoing for sev eral years.  The first working prototype was achieved in July 2003.  The Raman cell provides the wavelength shift to provide eye safe operation and was initially developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The Raman cell was further developed by IT T AES.  Note that there are no Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wavelength-converter systems, including optical parametric oscillators (OPO) or Raman cells in existence.  Still under development, the REAL version 1 system was tested at DPG in the autumn of 2004.  The REAL v2+ utilizes proprietary ITT enhancements to provide autonomous and continuous operation 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week operation with transmission of data to a monitor-security facility.  The ITT REAL v2 was delivered to the Pentagon Force Protection Agency in October 2005.  The DPG-acquired REAL v2+ will have technical enhancements beyond those of the REAL v2+ delivered to the Pentagon.  The enhancements include depolarization measurements using two separate channels to provide both co-pola rization and cross-polarization detection.  The laser pulse repetition rate will be increased and used in conjunction with an improved Raman-cell wavelength converter to provide volume imaging.  A calibrated backscatter measurement at 1.5 microns is to be demonstrated.  Finally, the entire upgraded system will be housed in a transportable, weather-hardened shelter for use at DPG and other test ranges.  Tasks for the REAL system include the following: (1) design; (2) procurement & fabrication of subsystems; (3) software modifications; (4) subsystem testing and system integration; (5) field deployment and commisioning; and (6) management tasks.  Optional task to include the additiona of a depolarization channel.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; h owever, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Supporting evidence must be furnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements.  If no responses are received, the Government wi ll proceed with sole source negotiations with ITT Advanced Engineering and Sciences.  The solicitation (W911S6-06-R-00005) will be available on or around 8 JUN 2006 through the Army Single Face to Industry website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ or t hrough the U.S. Army Contracting Agency  Dugway Proving Ground website at https://www.dugway.army.mil/10-3_ContractingDivision.htm (NOTE: When accessing either  the Army Single Face to Industry or the Dugway Proving Ground websites, make sure the web address begins with https not http to gain access to the secure web servers.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of automated COMINT collection and processing.  Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought.  The overall technical objectives of the BAA are to develop techniques and algorithms for the detection, recognition, exploitation, and location of analog and digital communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved digital signal processing hardware and software. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Signal detection (2) Signal recognition and classification in low Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) environments (3) Improved methods to accomplish geolocation (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD) algorithms (5) Interference cancellation (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked) (9) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms.  Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, geolocation in moderate to low SINR environments: Current SIGINT platforms are inundated with multiple signals of interest across the spectrum, but are not able to process all of the high priority signals for a host of reasons including dense signal environments, low power signals, low SINR, power control, etc. (2) Any technologies that will enable current systems greater ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and locate signals would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation:  Technology to further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is another area of research covered by this BAA.  Particular attention will be paid to technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters beneath interference.  (4) Multi-User Detection: Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired.  Specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms are also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamformed, digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antenna are desired. (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable is desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: We are interested in developing the above capabilities for existing and emerging military and commercial radio communications. (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked): We are interested in techniques for second, third and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (9) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to DSP requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.  (10) Modify and augment existing fielded SIGINT systems, and aid in the development of research capabilities that can be inserted into open architecture systems. Use simulation and modeling to analyze and assess technical performance of signal processing algorithms and techniques.  (11)  Support assessment, selection, and refinement of algorithms by evaluating different classes of algorithms and specific algorithm designs.   The contractor will work with Government organizations and other contractors to identify and acquire algorithms of interest, and provide technical, implementation and benefit assessments.  (12)  Participate in system planning activities for airborne SIGINT systems, including assessment of operational requirements, mission and threat analysis, threat signal characterization, and analysis of system operations.  (13)  Provide planning information to help anticipate new threat systems and enabling technologies and techniques; perform systems engineering of advanced SIGINT concepts and systems; develop and transition key algorithms and processing techniques; assist in collection, processing, and interpretation of test data; and evaluate alternative approaches and algorithms to assess their advantages and deficiencies.  (14)  Monitor developments that influence the character and priority of different potential SIGINT targets, trends in architecture and operations of SIGINT systems, and algorithms and implementation technologies for SIGINT processing.  Based on this information, the contractor will provide inputs to AFRL/IFEC to shape ongoing activities that best accommodate projected threat characteristics, develop capabilities that integrate with other SIGINT and sensor systems, and apply relevant and useful techniques and technologies in SIGINT processing.  Coordinate with organizations, users, platforms, and developers throughout the SIGINT community.  (15)  Assist in the development of capabilities that can be integrated with SIGINT and sensor systems. (16)  Work with AFRL/IFEC in planning, equipping, conducting, interpreting, and achieving field collections of relevant data.  Ensure that field collections obtain technically valid and operationally relevant data, in characterizing the collected data, and in documenting and formatting the data to support its use across the SIGINT community.  (17)  Participate in field testing and flight testing in order to accomplish data collection.   (18)  Be responsible for the development of the AFRL Blue Mountain collection and analysis in-house system. Support AFRL in-house research through data collections, integration and test of AFRL developed algorithms and techniques, development planning, acquisition support, and specialty engineering.

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) seeks white papers describing innovative technology concepts to ensure position accuracy for Mine Counter Measure (MCM)-related assets operating in the littorals.  Joint forces need the ability to accurately define the boundaries encompassing safe maneuver space and to accurately determine the location of platforms operating within the boundaries.  Examples of MCM-related activities to be supported include: establishment of amphibious operating areas, navigation of amphibious vehicles from over-the-horizon onto and through the beach; location of minefields using overhead reconnaissance platforms; and the location of mines using underwater reconnaissance platforms and divers.  Concepts can include GPS-based approaches, virtual marking, and physical marking (land operations only).  All concepts must be compatible with existing operational suites used by Joint forces to generate the common operational picture.  The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts. The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2007 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2009 or earlier.

ONR encourages teaming of academia, industry, University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and government laboratories with a view toward speeding the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.  
  
White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of the offerors in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the operational, technical and logistical feasibility of the concept. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission.  However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising or if no white paper is submitted.  

Approximately $9,000,000.00 of Applied Research and Advanced Technology (Budget Category 6.2/6.3) funds are anticipated to be available over a three year period beginning October 2006 to conduct this effort.

<DESC>AMENDMENT#1 TO PR-NC-06-10284 IS ISSUED FEBRUARY 27, 2006.  THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO RE-SCHEDULE THE TIME OF THE PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE FROM 1:00 PM TO 3:00 PM ON MARCH 9,2006 TO 2:00 PM TO 4:00 PM ON MARCH 9, 2006.The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from  national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.  Each contract will also include additional optional quantity labor hours in the amount of 22,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base period and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours each one of the option periods for a total of 190,000 labor hours for each contract.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.

<CONTACT>Eric Holder, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3959
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions that have been submitted regarding the above-mentioned solicitation. 1.  Question:  Please provide clarity on whether the Government will supply M- 11 Copper Crush Gauges. Answer:  The Government will provide one hundred M-11 Gauges, thirty days after  contract award to the successful bidder. 2.  Question:  Please provide clarity on whether the Government will supply  breeches and 105mm rifled gun tubes with at least 85% useful life remaining? Answer:  The Government will provide two breeches and two 105mm rifled gun  tubes.  These items will be made available at the Government Test Facilities. 3.  Question:  Please clarify the source for the tungsten indexing information  to be used with the tungsten rate re-opener. Answer:  Replace paragraph H.5 in its entirety with the following paragraph:   The winning contractor agrees to negotiate the cost of tungsten with the  Government prior to each option, if exercised.  If the market price of tungsten  increases or decreases, the winning contractor will re-price the negotiated  effort using the adjusted price of tungsten and calculate the cost impact.  The  contractor will submit the price of tungsten included in their basic proposal  along with the supporting cost detail for that price.  This price will be  considered the base index.  Thirty days prior to exercise of any option, the  contractor will provide the supporting cost detail for the market price of  tungsten along with a spreadsheet showing the impact on the contract price.   The Government will notify the contractor within 60 days of the intent to  exercise an option.  The maximum amount of any increase is 5% of the cartridge  unit price.  No adjustment will be made for any escalation amount that falls  within +/-10% of the base index.   4.  Question:  Verify the intended use of the additional M148A1B1 Cartridge  Cases as the answer to Question #2 in amendment 4 stated that the additional  cases â€œare for Government inventory to be supplied to the 105mm contractors as  GFMâ€.  Since the cases are not included in the list of GFM under the subject  RFP, it is our belief that the cases will not be provided as GFM on this  program to be used in the production of the M1040 option quantities.  Please  confirm that the additional cases will not be provided back to the successful  contractor under the contract resulting from this RFP. Answer:  Only the price of Clin 0001 for the M1040 Cartridges (FY06) shall  include the cost of the M148A1B1 cartridge case. Contractor will purchase the  M148A1B1 cartridge cases under Clins 0002 and 0006. The M148A1B1 cartridge  cases are being incrementally procured for use in program options as a means to  assure availability due to the planned shutdown of Riverbank AAP.  The M148A1B1  cartridge cases procured under Clin 0002 will be used for Options 1 and 2, if  exercised and as such, Clins 0004 and 0005 should not include the cost of the  M148A1B1 cartridge case.  The M148A1B1 cartridge cases procured under Clin 0006  will be used for Options 7 and 8, if exercised and as such, Clins 0007 and 0008  should not include the cost of the M148A1B1 cartridge case. 5. Question: FedBizzOpps has only formally issued Amendment A0001.  The rest of  the Amendments are notices only. Answer: Contractors shall make mention of receipt of all posted Amendments on  their cover page. 6.  The Solicitation closing date is hereby extended from 26 May 06 to 31 May  06, at 4:00 pm EST. 7. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. (End of Summary of Changes)

<DESC>LASER ENGAGEMENT SIMULATION SYSTEM

NNSA/NSO is interested in acquiring an engagement simulation system (ESS) for use in tactical training and evaluations of protective force members.  This ESS must provide effective simulation of the firing and effects of actual weapons systems during training exercises.  In general, the ESS shall consist of shooter weapons simulation system (i.e. a laser based communications channel mounted on government-furnished weapons) and a target effects system. The weapons/platforms to be simulated are M4 Rifle, 50cal Sniper Weapons System (SWS)], M240 & M60 machine guns and dismounted anti-armor weapons [e.g. Light Anti-Armor Weapon (AT-4 & RPG-7), vehicle detection systems which can be applied to various vehicles and a Man-Worn Detector System (MWDS).  A reactive target system, stay-behind booby trap, hand grenade and claymore-type devices shall be available.  A structural effects simulator is required which will provide responses that depend on targeting accuracy and the construction of the building.    Sensors shall differentiate between hits and near-misses and provide positive local indication of a lethal hit.  Vehicle and MWDS detectors shall support event storage, Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and a replay/after-action review capability that enables a rerun of the exercise on a computer modeling system upon completion of the exercise.  The procurement of necessary support items required to ensure the systems are operational, e.g. controller device, weapons alignment fixture, vehicle test set, etc., are included in this requirement. Equipment supplied must be compatible with the current family of MILES devices.

These techniques (Pank et al. 2001; Shivji et al. 2002; Chapman et al. 2003; Abercrombie et al. 2005; Shivji et al. 2005; Clarke et al. 2006; and unpublished data) will provide a quick species identification capability for identifying adults at transshipment ports which have already been dressed at sea, without the normal compliment if identifiable parts to recognize adults. These techniques are suitable for identification of larvae, which are difficult to identify, particularly when they are less than 6 mm in length. Dr. Shivji is an internationally recognized leader in the area of developing molecular forensic techniques to problems of species identification in pelagic fisheries research, management and law enforcement.  Dr. Shivji’s laboratory is located in close proximity to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, enabling rapid transfer of highly perishable billfish tissue. Dr. Shivji’s laboratory, as the pioneer in development of the streamlined, multi-species forensic assay, is the only know source with direct experience to develop a similar forensic assay for billfish. The anticipated performance period is from date of award through September 30, 2006. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications, and any additional supporting literature.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to determine potential small business (SB) sources in preparation for a future procurement. The EPA, Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center (TSC) requires contractor support for analytical laboratory services in conjunction with implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR). To ensure sufficient laboratory capacity, it is anticipated that multiple contracts will be established under this requirement as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contracts. The EPA has the responsibility to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrence in order to characterize drinking water threats. While EPA relies on independent research efforts, it also is heavily engaged in conducting drinking water occurrence studies to obtain new data. The largest of these studies is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR. The UCMR is a 5-year cyclic monitoring program, which allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water. The anticipated strategy is to select the key contaminants identified as occurrence priorities, which when combined with health effects data and available drinking water treatment technologies, enable EPA to establish National Primary Drinking Water Standards and maximize the protection of public health. The second cycle of UCMR has been proposed (UCMR2) and is expected to be promulgated in late 2006. As a means to reduce the UCMR compliance burden on small public water systems (those serving less than 10,000 individuals), EPA selects a representative sample of small systems that must comply with the UCMR monitoring requirements  This procurement will specifically serve as the means for conducting these sample analyses. Successful offerors to PR-CI-06-10768 shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities to support the tasked analytical services included in the Statement of Work.  Tasks anticipated in this procurement include:  1)	Conducting laboratory analyses, following all required QC using methods promulgated for UCMR2.  An interested small business laboratory will need to have EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529), at a minimum.  Additional analyses may be tasked if the small business laboratory also has EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 2 Screening Survey methods (EPA Methods 521, 525.2 and 535).  2)	Providing logistical support by logging, receiving, confirming appropriate preservation, and storing field samples received at their laboratory in support of this contract. 3)	Reporting results in a timely manner using an EPA specified electronic format. 4)	Preparing monthly reports identifying any problems encountered as well as the status of work completed and on-going analyses. Under a separate contract vehicle, EPA will coordinate the preparation of these kits and the collection of these samples.  To reiterate, laboratories will not be responsible for sample shipping costs, unless these shipping costs are the direct result of chronic sample recollections due to gross laboratory negligence or incompetence. Firms interested in this requirement need to recognize that it will need to have EPA approval (or ?pending approval?) for UCMR2 as a prerequisite to be considered for award for the request for proposal (RFP) when it is issued.  To attain EPA approval, UCMR2 laboratory application(s) must be complete without unresolved deficiencies and firms must have passed an EPA offered proficiency testing (PT) study for each of the respective methods.  Laboratories can learn more about the UCMR2 Laboratory Approval Program at:  www.epa.gov/safewater/ucmr/ucmr2/labs.html.   The anticipated contracts will have a total potential performance period of five years. EPA estimates a sum total (adding all methods individually and multiplying by the number of applicable PWSs and anticipated sampling locations per PWS) of 41,000 sample analyses will be ordered over the five year multiple award contract term.  This total includes the sum of an estimated: 9,360 analyses for EPA Method 527; 9,360 analyses for Method 529; 11,232 analyses for EPA Method 521; 5,616 analyses for EPA Method 525.2; and, 5,616 analyses for EPA Method 535.  The vast majority of these analyses will be conducted during the three year monitoring period for UCMR2 (proposed to extend from July 2007 through June 2010).   The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  ANY INTERESTED FIRM should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  The capability statement should include or address: -  Any correspondence that indicates your firm is actively pursuing EPA UCMR2 Laboratory Approval (i.e., copy of the laboratory's UCMR2 laboratory approval program registration sheet, or an EPA cover letter associated with the laboratory approval program). -  Appropriate documentation indicating state certification, such as a copy of a state drinking water laboratory certification certificate, that demonstrates your firm's experience conducting analytical methods which utilize solid phase extraction (SPE) / gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS)  (e.g., EPA Method 525.2).  -  Any documentation demonstrating your firm's experience or available instrumentation (GC/MS) that utilizes programmed temperature vaporizing (PTV) injection (as appropriate to EPA Method 529). -  Any documentation demonstrating your firm's experience or available instrumentation using large volume injection / chemical ionization (CI)/GC/MS/MS (as appropriate to EPA Method 521).  This is not a primary request, consequently, firms that do not have this instrumentation should simply indicate as such.  Small business laboratories are encouraged to respond, even if it does not have this specific experience or instrumentation. -  Any documentation demonstrating your firm's experience or available instrumentation using liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS (as appropriate to EPA Method 535).  This is not a primary request, consequently, laboratories that do not have this instrumentation should simply indicate as such.  Small business laboratories are encouraged to respond, even if your firm does not have this specific experience or instrumentation. Copies of these methods are available for down-load using the links at:  www.epa.gov/safewater/ucmr/ucmr2/methods.html. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this sources sought synopsis. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified HubZone, 8(a), Woman-Owned, Small Disadvantaged and/or Disabled Veteran-Owned concern. EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for Small Businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to: David Plagge, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268 or FEDEX/handcarry to 4411 Montgomery Road, Norwood, OH 45212 or via e-mail at plagge.david@epa.gov  by July 1, 2006. An RFP will be synopsized on the Fed Biz Opps Website at a later date. The current projected start date of the contract is May 1, 2007.

<DESC>The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.  Each contract will also include additional optional quantity labor hours in the amount of 22,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base period and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours each one of the option periods for a total of 190,000 labor hours for each contract.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.    The purpose of the conference is to provide background information concerning the Statement of Work (SOW) to potential offerors and to create an open forum for discussions concerning the objectives of the project.  Any and all questions submitted should be directly related to the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria.  There will be no discussion of budget at the conference or any other subject matter that does not directly pertain to the DRAFT SOW or technical evaluation criteria.  Both the draft statement of work and evaluation factors are available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  The conference will be held on March 9, 2006 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at the EPA-RTP main campus.  A map and directions to EPA's Research Triangle Park, NC campus are located at EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/. Confirmation of attendance and questions regarding the draft documents, must occur by 12:00 P.M. (EST) on March 03, 2006 via email to Laconda Cannady at cannady.laconda@epa.gov.  Please use "PR-NC-06-10284-Pre-solicitation Conference" as your subject line.  Telephone confirmations are not acceptable for this procurement.   Pre-solicitation conference attendance is limited to two (2) individuals that best represent the prospective offerors company.  Any questions and/or comments that you would prefer not to discuss in a group format due to proprietary reasons should be submitted in writing to Laconda Cannady via email no later than March 06, 2006 and explicitly labeled ?proprietary?.  EPA handling of such questions/comments and subsequent responses will be handled in accordance with normal agency procedures for protection of proprietary data.  There will be NO reimbursement for travel expenses related to the participation in the pre-solicitation conference.  All responses to questions/comments concerning the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria discussed at the pre-solicitation conference and not deemed proprietary will be compiled and distributed to all interested parties.  The RFP will be issued approximately April 26, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.

<DESC>Request for Information Title: National Acquisition Strategy (NAS) re-compete for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to re-compete its Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services (VR&E) contracts.  VR&E services are described in the attached draft SOW and other draft attachments included in this RFI.  This is a sources sought announcement, and is not a request for quotations or a request for proposals.  VA has an Integrated Process Team (IPT) looking at alternatives acquisition strategies to determine best possible outcome on the re-compete of these services.  The IPT team will be formed to include internal shareholders from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the VA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and the contracting officer as well as industry.  The purpose of the IPT is to develop and implement an acquisition strategy to enhance the performance of VR&E contractors while maximizing cost savings. The VA is looking for alternatives and is looking for industries' input as to what the market will bear.   The VA is looking for alternatives to include consolidation by region or national contracts to include Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan or Performance Requirement Survey (to include present risks and benefits of each alternative).  To all interested parties review all attached material (draft RFQ, frequently asked questions, etc.) and provide information that should be considered prior to making a final decision on appropriate acquisition strategy.  VA has authority, pursuant to Title 38 USC chapters 18, 31, 35 and 36, to provide all services and assistance necessary to enable eligible veterans with service-connected disabilities to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment. In the discharge of this responsibility each VA Regional Office Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service Division (VR&E) within the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) undertakes an initial evaluation of the veteran to determine his or her eligibil!  ity and  entitlement for these services and assistance; develops, in cooperation with the veteran, an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP); and provides the veteran with employment placement and post-placement services or, if employment is not possible, services to enhance the veteran's independence in daily living. The objective of this contract is to provide assistance to VR&E in the following areas, in accordance with the Performance Requirements in Section II of this solicitation:  (1) initial evaluation; (2) case management of veterans rehabilitative program; (3) draft IWRP development; and (4) assist the veteran in finding employment consistent with his or her aptitudes, interests and abilities or, if employment is not achievable in achieving maximum independence in daily living.  The government is contemplating the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts for VR&E services.  The original award of the VR&E contracts the government awarded multiple Firm Fixed Price contracts based on services groups.  During the course of these contracts the government issued task orders to each contractor receiving an award under these multiple award contract.  The minimum cumulative amount of all orders for any single Contractor was $500.00 over the life of the contract.

<SUBJECT>58--CAISI Bridge Module and CAISI Client Module Upgrades
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-XX-X-XXXX
<RESPDATE>061206
<ARCHDATE>08112006
<CONTACT>Gregory Roddy, (703) 325-3318
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.    The US Army Contracting Agency, ITEC4, is planning an acquisition for the replacement of the CAISI bridge module (CBM) and the CAISI client module (CCM) components of the CAISI System.  By 2010 the Army expe cts to employ over 12,000 next generation CAISI bridge modules to replace current CBMs and CCMs. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified, interested sources that can provide IEEE 802.11 a and b/g radios and an 8 port switch device for a new C BM.  Candidate Solution demonstrations for the next Version of CAISI. Vendors are asked to provide candidate solutions for the next version of CAISI CBM along with any associated management server and other equipment, if required.  Written input and replies to this Sources Sought Request will be evaluated to determine candid ate systems that are prepared to demonstrate their capabilities during a four day Phase One Test at Ft. Huachuca AZ.  Phase One Tests will be scheduled during the months of June-July 2006.  A Test Plan and associated details will be provided to the finalis ts who are chosen to demonstrate their solutions.     Following the Phase One Testing, the candidate radio performance and features will be evaluated.  Those that are deemed functionally sufficient will then be compared to each other to identify those which give the U.S. Army the most cost effective solutions  within time and budget constraints.  Candidates that meet the minimum capabilities and criteria will be considered for a Phase Two Test with 39 CBM modules and one set of administrative components.   The U.S. Government will purchase the Phase Two set of equipment. The Phase Two Test will be scheduled in the month of August 2006.  If the devices perform well in the Phase Two Test, they will be subsequently used by the training, security and integration  teams to develop documentation required for a field test the new equipment with a Brigade Combat Team (BCT).  The field test is tentatively scheduled for February 2007.  Feedback from the field test will be incorporated into final fielding design and if t he equipment proves effective, the Army will proceed with a Full Army-wide deployment. Phase One will demonstrate the bridging and the access point functions and measure throughput distance and capacity.  The bridging will be tested on omni-directional antennas from a distance of a ¼ mile to a distance of 2 miles with an access point service  running at one end. During the Phase One Test, ISEC will provide the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz antennas, masts and RF cables with standard N-male connectors.  ISEC will provide power for the equipment and test range locations in a monitored RF environment. Candidat e radios will demonstrate their throughput in point-to-point bridging using the directional antennas at  8, 16 and 32 mile distances.   During the Phase One Tests the vendors will become familiar with the associated antennas and cables, uninterruptible pow er supply and other accessories the government is currently considering for use in the new CAISI.  Vendors can provide recommendations for alternate accessories that may be considered for CAISI, but all candidate radios will be tested with the same governm ent components to ensure integrity of test results.   In testing long range radio links, throughput will be measured by Iperf, a bandwidth tool developed by the Distributed Applications Support Team of the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research, or Qcheck, a commercial network troubleshooting utilit y from Ixia® that checks network response time, throughput, and streaming performance.  CURRENTLY FIELDED CAISI DESIGN. The USAISEC design includes CAISI CBMs and CAISI CCMs.  The CBM, uses a Cisco® Aironet 350 series wireless bridge as its radio.  The CCM, uses the Cisco® Aironet 350 series workgroup bridge. Both the CBMs and the CCMs have Air Fortress" AF-1100 inline encryption devices and Ethernet hub(s).  The CBM also includes an ADC megabit m odem 300SBP digital subscriber line (DSL) device to extend the network via field wire where environmental or operational conditions limit wireless communications. Cisco® Aironet 350 series wireless bridges and wireless workgroup bridges use the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.11b standard in the 2.4 Gigahertz (GHz) band, with an 11 megabit per second (Mbps) data rate.  These bridges combi ne with the CAISI ruggedized antennas and reach up to four miles with clear line-of-sight (LOS) on a level terrain.  Greater distances of 8, 16 and even 32 miles can be achieved, with reduced throughput, when traversing across a valley where LOS is combine d with open Fresnel area. The CAISI equipment is designed to provide encrypted wireless connectivity for the unclassified CSS systems in a deployed four mile-square Brigade Combat Team (BCT) logistics support area.  CSS computers use their regular network interface card to connect to the hub in the CBM. The Air Fortress" AF-1100 was validated in 2002 in accordance with (IAW) the FIPS 140-1 to provide inline encryption, and is approved for SBU U.S. Government data.  A CAISI module and antenna is deployed into each work area  one or more tents, vans, or sh elters under a single camouflage net  that has STAMIS computers or computers serving CSS functions.  A single CAISI node includes up 39 modules.  One CBM at each field site is designated as the central, or root node.  This node controls the LAN for that f ield site, sets parameters for, and directs traffic among other radios in the network.  The root node normally links the CAISI LAN to an SBU Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) port through the long-haul connections provided by the curren t Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) or the new Brigade Subscriber Node (BSN).  The Air Fortress" AF-1100 gateway throughput is seven Mbps (migrating to 13 Mbps when replaced by the Air Fortress" AF-2100). The ADC megabit modem 300SBP is a high-performance synchronous DSL modem, modified for CAISI to include binding posts for connection to standard tactical field wire.  In CAISI, the 300SBP is used back to back with another 300SBP, but it could be used with the Avidia® System AV421 24-port single-line digital subscriber line (SDSL) module for high-density applications, if required.  ADCs rate-selectable modems enable the user to manually choose transmission speed in order to obtain the best possible data rat e for distance and line condition.  Users who are closer than four miles apart will achieve the highest (2 Mbps) data rate, while those farther apart or using degraded wire lines will connect at lower rates. A Service Support Representative (SSR) kit is fielded with each set of up to 39 CBMs and CCMs.  The radios in the CBMs are multi functional.  First, they perform point to multi-point wireless bridging using the CBMs 12 decibels (dBi) gain omni-directional  antenna.  This allows work areas to spread out a mile from the network uplink connection at the local satellite terminal. Second, the CBM radios provide automatic relaying to the root radio.  This critical feature allows the 39 stations to overcome the in herent problems of not being able to have clear line of sight to the single root CBM radio.   When they cannot associate directly to the root, the CBMs will automatically associate with the strongest sister CBM that does have a communication path to the ro ot.   Any CBM radio can be configured as root.  The third feature of the CBM radios is the ability to extend the distance between work areas by establishing a point to point link using the 13 dBi high gain directional antennas that is in each SSR kit.  Usi ng two of these directional antennas, a link of 2 miles is able to maintain a 2Mbps throughput when no interference is present.  Distances of 8 miles can be achieved when using the two 19dBi directional antennas that are provided in the SSR kit when clear line of sight is available. Even longer distances of 16 and 32 miles have been achieved in tests across a clear valley with a reduction of throughput down to 350 Kbps. The SSR kit contains a notebook computer used for troubleshooting and initial configuration of the CAISI devices before distribu tion to the users.  The SSR kit also contains additional bridges, encryptors, DSL, and power supplies, as well as four 50 feet radio frequency (RF) cables, an AB 1244 mast kit, and two directional 19 dBi hi-gain antennas for use depending on terrain or lon g distance special circumstances. The CAISI equipment is now being used extensively in U.S. Army deployments in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  While the primary purpose of CAISI is to provide network connectivity between CSS systems within logistics su pport areas, the soldiers now have access to electronic mail and other services, resulting in a significant boost in morale as well as operational effectiveness. CAISI DISTANCE ENHANCEMENT NEEDED. The current CAISI implementation uses technology which constrains wireless operations to LOS configurations..  This limitation precluded the CAISI equipment from linking the battalion support areas and Combat Repair Teams (CRT) back to the BSAs during the opening phases of OIF.  Some units are so dispersed geographically that the CAISI equipment cannot connect them.  CSS virtual small aperture terminal (VSAT) uplinks are an option capable of providing the interconnection at a substantial acquisition and ope rational cost.   The new CAISI will incorporate longer range terrestrial radios to reach 32 miles with clear line of sight and achieve throughputs of at least 5 Mbps. CAISI NEXT VERSION OBJECTIVES. Over 500 next generation CAISI network administrator kits will be employed to support new CAISI modules. USAISEC personnel will review emerging technologies and evaluate COTS equipment which can accomplish, to the greatest extent feasible, the following objectives 1.  Minimize the U.S. Government fabrication and assembly process by integrating the functions and features of the separate devices into a minimum number of COTS products. 2.  Simplify the configuration and setup process required of the soldier.  (See the auto configuration requirements section of this synopsis). 3.  Improve throughput, range and resilience to interference when compared to the current CAISI. 4. Enhance network authentication authorization and intrusion detection to improve information assurance capabilities. ENHANCEMENT AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NEXT VERSION OF CAISI.  Deployed CSS units generally do not have experienced network management personnel.  Units must be able to operate CAISI without a dedicated administrator.  The SSR for the CAISI equipment is doctrinally the unit Signal Staff Officer (S-6), whose personnel  are responsible for all the communications within the unit.  Communications and control systems consume the majority of their time and expertise.  CSS Automation Management Officer (CSSAMO) section may assist the S-6 in CAISI set up and administration.  T he CSSAMO however, already have substantial STAMIS hardware, software, and procedural responsibilities.  CAISI SSR duties must be minimized and simplified as much as possible.  Complicated administrative duties may lead to inadvertent configurations which cause loss of communications or a lack of appropriate security.  Like the current CAISI equipment, the next version of CAISI must also be able to provide secure communication within a deployed area, whether or not reach-back connectivity is available.  The battalion and the CRT, for instance, must be able to operate whe n not connected to the brigade, and the brigade must be able to operate when not connected to higher headquarters or to the NIPRNET. The CAISI modules, antennas, cables, and accessories must be extensively evaluated for durability, reliability, and ease of use. They must be set up and disassembled repeatedly in mobile a nd highly variable climatic conditions to ensure that soldiers will be able to do so effectively.  CSS soldiers must be able to quickly and effectively employ the CAISI equipment and to quickly tear it down to jump to the next site. Weight and cubic size must also be minimized, to reduce any impact that the CAISI equipment might have on unit mobility and the soldiers state of readiness. Since the CAISI equipment is deployed in small groups of two to five modules or in larger groups of up to 39 modules, deployment must occur without excessive reconfiguration or troubleshooting.  The CAISI equipment must also be able to be quickly and easil y reconfigured to join and operate with adjacent U.S. Army CSS units. CAISI modules must be able to simultaneously act as access points, bridges to other CAISI modules, and relays for other CAISI modules and clients.  CAISI must be able to use light weight radios and antennas that can be mounted on camouflage poles or within  the work areas under the camouflage netting.  The number of antennas and the effort required to install and aim them must be minimized. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT VERSION OF CAISI. The GCSS-A will provide all the functionality that is available today in the following STAMISs: "	Standard Army Retail Supply System-Objective "	Unit Level Logistics System "	Standard Property Book System-Redesign "	Standard Army Ammunition System "	Integrated Logistics Analysis Program  "	Standard Army Maintenance System The next version of the CAISI equipment must support the GCSS-A.  This means that it must be able to do everything the current CAISI does plus additional capability.  The next version of CAISI must be better, faster, and cheaper. As noted in the previous section, candidates considered for the next version of CAISI will be compared and evaluated for many difficult to quantify aspects of deployability, reliability, and ease of use, in addition to the performance metrics listed below. 1.  Access point, bridging and relaying functions.  The candidate solution must be able to simultaneously act as access points, bridges and relays for other modules and clients.  Even though only the current CBM has this capability, the next version of CAI SI should improve this so that all modules have this capability. 2.  Single reach back requirements.  The candidate solution must operate in point-to-multipoint cascade mode with up to 39 modules in a single meshed network using a single reach back WAN connection.  Each of the 39 modules must pass data simultaneously.    The candidate solution must achieve all of the following simultaneously:  In one relay hop to the root radio, average throughput must be greater than 0.600 Mbps.  In two hops to the root 0.180 Mbps.  In three hops 37 kbps.  During Phase One Test a netwo rk capacity test will be performed in the lab on a set of 7 of the proposed radio devices from each vendor transmitting in concert.  Throughput will be measured by Spirent® SmartBits SMB-6000B network testing equipment and the Spirent® SmartFlow applicatio n.  The network capacity test will be performed on set of 39 radios for the Phase Two Testing. 3.  Point-to-multipoint distance.  The bridging radios must operate in point-to-multipoint mode with 9 decibels (dBi) external omni directional antennas installed not to exceed 16 ft in height above ground level. The radio must be able to be mounted on the  mast and use power over Ethernet to in order to avoid line loss associated with extended RF cables. The Phase One Test will demonstrate the throughput capabilities using a 3ft long, 3/8 Andrew FSJ2-50 series RF cable.  With level terrain and clear LOS, en crypted throughput over a 1 mile distance must be greater than 2 Mbps.  Throughput at 2 miles must be at least 1.2 Mbps.   4.  Point-to-point distance.  For the long distance links beyond the local support area, the modules must be able to operate in point-to-point bridging mode.  Phase One Test will demonstrat e throughput capabilities in a government prescribed environment, with 21 dBi directional antennas installed to provide clear LOS on each end.  Throughput at a distance of 8 miles must be at least 6 Mbps. Throughput; at a distance of 16 miles must be at le ast 5 Mbps.  Throughput at  32 miles must be at least 4Mbps .   5.  Antennas.  The new CBM will have a 21dBi directional antenna for the bridging radio that will achieve the above distances and throughput.  The antennas must weigh less than 4 pounds each.  The CBM must also have two 9dbi omni antennas, one for the acce ss point radio and the other for the bridging radio.  Government will provide the antennas to be used during the Phase One Test. 6.  Lightening protection.  The candidate solution must include multi-strike lightning arrestors for all antennas installed. The unit must have a corrosion  resistant grounding stud accessible from the exterior of the chassis.  The connector on the lightni ng arrestor must be standard N-female to match the Nmale connectors of the RF-cables currently used by the U.S. Government for CAISI. If the module uses power-over-Ethernet (PoE) to operate a radio mounted at or in an externally mounted antenna, then the PoE cable requires lightning surge protection. Lightning protection must have Mulit-strike and UL certification.  7. CAISI bridge module cost.   This solicitation is limited to the access point, bridge and switch (ap/br/sw) for a single enclave of 39 CBMs.  At this time the U.S. Government will not consider any ap/br/sw combination that costs more than $2000 when purc hased in quantities of 1000 or more. 8.  Module weight.  The weight of the ap/br/sw combination must not exceed 10 lbs.  The weight of the ap/br and antenna components that will be attached to a mast must be as low as possible to avoid the additional requirement of fielding a mast kit to acco mpany each candidate solution.  The government will determine the specific elements composing the overall weight measurement to accommodate all configurations (mast mount vs. other).  9.  Volume.  The overall volume of the ap/br/sw combination must not exceed 400 cubic inches.   The government will determine the specific elements composing the overall volume measurement to accommodate all configurations (mast mount vs. other).. 10. Ethernet switch ports.  Each module must have at least eight 10/100 Ethernet ports for wired network devices.  The switch ports must be auto sensing and auto uplink RJ45 ports.  The candidate solution must support port based access control. If the radi o does not include the 8 switch ports the radio can be accompanied with a separate manageable switch that is IEEE 802.1x compliant.  11. Power requirements. The candidate solution must operate with the following power input;   100 - 240 VAC/ (60 or 50 Hz).    The candidate solution must remain fully operational for at least 20 minutes using a Tripplite model 300i Internet UPS which is r ated for 300VA, 185Watts.  12.  Temperature Requirement.  The candidate solution must be capable of operating between temperatures from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius.  If a switch is separate from the radio it must be able to operate from 0  45 degrees Celsius. 15.  Radio Enclosure.  The radio equipment that must be mounted on an outdoor mast must be Type 3 approved National Electrical manufacturers association (NEMA) or better.  16.  Transmission power.  The transmit power must be adjustable for lower outputs to comply with a variety of locality restrictions that may be required by allied host nations.  Radios must have FCC and CE certificates. 17.  Frequency and Modulation  CAISI will use internationally accepted unlicensed frequencies and IEEE standards based radio modulation.  IEEE 802.11a must be used for the bridging and 802.11 b/g must be used for the access point. 18.  Common Criteria Validation.  Network security devices must have or be in-process for National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Crit eria validation for a medium robustness environment.  Compliance must be validated on the NIST NIAP (U.S. Government) web site at http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/vpl/vpl_type.html or on the in-process list at http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/in_evaluation.htm l. 19.  Root configuration.  Any module must be able to be configured as a root for a candidate solution network. The root is the module that is used at the base of the CAISI network tree.  20.  Seamless Roaming capability.  The candidate solution must support mobile clients transitioning between access points without user reconfiguration.   21.  Radio status indicators.  The candidate solution must have an external indication that the radio is associated to the network.  The bridging radio must have an external received signal strength indicator to assist in antenna alignment.  The solution m ust have the ability to enable/disable the signal strength indicator.  22.  FIPS approved encryption. The candidate solution must have FIPS 140-2 certified encryption.  The encryption device, subsystem, or component must have a certificate from NIST validating compliance with the FIPS 140-2, overall level 2, see http://csrc.n ist.gov/cryptval/.  Candidate solutions may be in the process of FIPS and  NIST certifications for consideration as well. Vendor must provide supporting documentation and commitment timeline. 23.  Support for Wireless clients.   Candidate solution must have certification for Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) enterprise and WPA2 personal mode.    24.  COTS requirement.  The system must be COTS.  The equipment must be available for purchase on open market and government contract vehicles for a period of at least three years after selection and supportable for a period of at least three additional ye ars for a total of 6 years. . AUTO CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT VERSION OF CAISI. A major new capability desired in the next version of CAISI is the ability for the modules to automatically configure themselves into a secure network with little or no SSR intervention.  Auto configuration must achieve, to the greatest extent possible, th e following: 1.  Automatically generate new configuration.  The means to automatically generate a new configuration for a new CAISI network deployment without requiring the administrator to make up and manually key-in the passwords, access identifications (ID), and enc ryption keys. 2.  Eliminate U.S. Government software application.   Eliminate the requirement for a separate U.S. Government software application for configuration. 3.  Shared cryptographic keys.  Ensure that the shared cryptographic keys are random, unique, and un-guessable. 4.  Eliminate human errors.  Eliminate failures resulting from human error when entering passwords, service set ID (SSID), cryptographic keys, Internet protocol (IP) address configurations, radio parameters, etc. 5.  Promulgation.   Provide an external means to promulgate the auto configuration from a previously configured module into non-root modules that will operate in the same network.  For this function the non-root modules would be physically connected to the  previously configured modules.  Also include an external indication of success, like a status light, on the equipment. 6.  Administrative Management.  Provide a means for the SSR to log in to the root module and manually adjust any parameters, such as the IP addresses, distance parameters, etc. 7.  Configuration Management. Provide a means to distribute configuration changes, including the SSID and cryptographic keys, from the root to all or selected non-root modules. Allow the SSR to capture and store the configuration onto the SSR laptop, and t o restore the configuration later to the same or a replacement module.

<SUBJECT>R -- OPTOELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR MODE RESOLVED OPTICAL COMB CONTROL
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Purdue University for an Optoelectronic system. The University will be responsible for the design, construction and testing of a high performance opto-electronic system for mode-resolved temporal/spectral control of individual modes of a femtosecond optical frequency comb. Hardware developed must be integrated with an existing Optical Frequency Synthesizer (OFS) referenced to a NIST optical atomic frequency standard in the NIST, Boulder laboratory. The tasks are as follows:
1.	Design optical system that can resolve and control individual modes of a femtosecond-optical-frequency-comb (FOFC) based on a high-repetition rate mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with the following characteristics
a.	Self-referenced laser parameters
i.	Pulse repetition rate 1 GHz
ii.	Offset frequency phase-locked using the 1f-2f or 2f-3f method
b.	Optical interferometer
i.	Central wavelength band of primary interest is near 650 nm 
ii.	Produce output display as 2-dimensional optical array that spatially and spectrally resolves individual modes in manor that would allow temporal and spatial control of the amplitude and phase of individual modes.
2.	Construct the optical interferometer designed in task 1 in the NIST-OFMG Boulder laboratory with input optical beam provided by NIST broadband optical frequency comb.
3.	Construct optical detection system capable of resolving and displaying individual comb modes as two-dimensional image and demonstrate with NIST FOFC.  
4.	Evaluate the performance of the optical interferometer constructed in task 2 in terms of the following critical parameters.
a.	Spectral/spatial resolving power
b.	Frequency domain spectral resolving power
c.	Detection system performance relative to fundamental limits (shot noise, thermal noise, optical power)
i.	Detection sensitivity
ii.	Background noise levels (optical and electronic)
iii.	Temporal bandwidth
5.	Demonstrate the performance of such a mode-resolved comb by application to high resolution spectroscopy of an atomic/molecular system. 
6.	Design modulation system for use with this spatially/spectrally resolved comb
a.	Ability  to phase modulate individual comb modes
b.	Ability to amplitude modulate individual comb modes
c.	Evaluate constraints on performance including: temporal bandwidth, optical power limits, amplitude and phase fidelity, and feasibility for fabrication into an array structure.  
Deliverables for these items will be a combination of written documents, verbal presentations, assembled hardware as described above and integrated with NIST-OFMG optical frequency comb, and test reports.  Components and instrumentation will be provided by the NIST-OFMG.  Work must be completed prior to July 2007.  Purdue University is the only group in the world that has developed a method and demonstrated its feasibility for resolving individual comb modes of a femtosecond mode-locked laser and is therefore the only qualified source to complete this work.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

<SUBJECT>66 -- METS VALIDATION SOFTWARE ANd METS 231s FOR EDWARDS AFB, CA.
<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement

SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR METS-231 AND METS VALIDATION SOFTWARE.  

DESC: INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WITH SCIENTIFIC DATA SYSTEMS (SDS), LCC.  The Air Force, at Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to SCIENTIFIC DATA SYSTEMS (SDS), LCC, 2137 North Main Street, Las Cruces, NM 88001.  The Sole Source purchase will be for the following commercial items: 

1)  METS Validation Software, Including IRIG-B, IRG-G, PCM (8 Channels), MIL-STD 1553 (1 Dual redundant bus), Video (2 Channels), Ethernet (2 Channels), and ARINC 429 (8 Channels).   (Quantity – 1)

2)  UPGRADED METS-231s from METS-201, including all necessary hardware/software modification and additions.  (Quantity – 5) 

Freight is FOB Destination.  Delivery schedule is 30 weeks ARO.  

The goal is to implement and apply commonality, standardization, and interoperability amongst all major test ranges and facility bases (MTRFB). The basic strategy to accomplish these goals is by providing standard instrumentation and instrumentation support system components to instrumentation operations engineers.  Since Eglin AFB developed IRIG 106, Chapter 10 verification and validation procedures, they procured METS-201 to accomplish these procedures.  In January 2006, Edwards AFB followed suit and procured the same system for standardization and commonality.  This contract action is a procurement of METS-231 which is an upgrade of METS-201.  It is; therefore, paramount that Edwards AFB should procure METS-231 from the same company for cost effectiveness.

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the items above.   Responses may be sent via e-mail to Terence.vickers@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412 TW/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Terence D. Vickers.  Phone Number 661-277-9559 and Fax Number: 661-275-7860.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 4 June 2006, a Sole Source purchase order will be pursued with SCIENTIFIC DATA SYSTEMS (SDS), LCC, 2137 North Main Street, Las Cruces, NM 88001.

<SUBJECT>--Meteorological Support Services (MSS), U.S. Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS)
<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with 3D Research Corporation (3DRC), Huntsville, Alabama, for a four (4) extension to the current 3DRC Contract DASG60-03-C-0107.  The proposed action is pursua nt to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This extension is required to maintain uninterrupted Meteorological Support Services (MSS) in support of the US Army Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS) mission operations pending completion of a competitive award currently underway for MSS.  Award to any source other than 3DRC would not support current agency commitments and test schedules and would result in unacceptable delays and substantia l costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The extension will support the execution of work planned until a new competitive award can be completed.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new co ntractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition of this short term effort.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward 3D Research Corporation.  This acquisition is not  open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed co ntract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Senior Development Advisor (SDA) to SOCOM will serve as a key USAID lead in developing coordinated programs, systems, and coordination mechanisms in critical regions and program functions for the US national security interest.  

B.	BACKGROUND

The USAID Office of Military Affairs (OMA) was created as of March 2005.  It is housed within the USAID Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA Bureau, also home to the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), Food for Peace (FFP), Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Democracy and Governance (DG) Offices), but its responsibilities are Agency-wide.  Its objective is to help USAID and the military define, evaluate and develop programs and coordination mechanisms that address areas of common interest between the U.S. defense and development communities, including but not limited to the U.S. National Security Strategy.  

To accomplish this objective, the following tasks will be undertaken:

1.  Evaluate and develop joint and parallel planning and programs focused on regional and field missions supported through USAID regional bureaus and DOD combatant commands (COCOMs).  

2.  Develop mutually acceptable guidance, policy and doctrine as needed for effective program development and coordination.  

3.  Implement training, education and operational programs designed to build understanding and operational efficiency between the two organizations.

Program areas of common interest include, but may not be limited to, humanitarian assistance, the global war on terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, and transformational development.  

The office will serve as the Agency-wide unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship.  This responsibility includes program planning and implementation needed for effective operations involving USAID and the military, and the development of operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The office will consist of two divisions, one for planning and one for operations.  The functions of the planning division  is to serve as the overall coordination unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship, and for planning, program development/management needed for effective future joint and parallel operations involving USAID and the military (U.S. and others).  The operations division will serve as the lead unit to develop operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The locus of informed and enhanced field operations within the US military resides in the combatant commands, both regional and functional.  The key regional commands of specific interest to USAID are as follows:

CENTCOM, or Central Command.  Located at McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, CENTCOM is responsible for field operations throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.  This command covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Central Asia, making it the most important and active command at this point in time.

EUCOM, or the European Command.  Located in Stuttgart, Germany, EUCOM is responsible for North, West and Southern Africa, the Caucuses, Europe and Russia.  Africa is now its most strategically important territory.  

PACOM, or the Pacific Command.  Located at Camp Smith in Honolulu, HI, PACOM is responsible for Asia and the Pacific up to the border of Pakistan.  While northern Asia (China, Japan and Korea) are key areas of focus, Southeast and South Asia are increasingly important in the Global War on Terror.  Indonesia and the Philippines are of particular importance.  

SOUTHCOM, or the Southern Command.  Located in Miami, FL, SOUTHCOM is responsible for South and Central America.  Although natural disaster and counter-narcotics responses have been the major focus of civ-mil operations in the recent past, there is a growing list of countries of concern and joint interest on the development front in the region.  

SOCOM, or the Special Operations Command.  Located in McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, SOCOM oversees Special Forces of all services, Civil Affairs, and Psyops.  SOCOM is considered the lead command for the Global War on Terror.  Civil Affairs is a key interlocutor with USAID in most countries on humanitarian and development assistance, and will likely look to a more collaborative relationship with USAID under emerging stability operations programs under DOD.  SOCOM officially requested an advisor during a recent visit of Gen. Dailey to the USAID Administrator.  SOCOM’s role in Stability Operations, Civil Affairs and the Global War on Terror all involve a substantial intersect with USAID’s development agenda.  

C. 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) will serve as USAID’s senior development advisor to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  The overall objective is to strengthen both DOD and USAID planning and operations in SOCOM through improved coordination and joint action between the two organizations.  The PSC will serve for a period of two years, with option to extend an additional two years based on mutual agreement.  The PSC will be stationed at SOCOM in MacDill Air Force Base, and will work within the SOCOM Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG).  

The PSC will report to the Senior Military Advisor in the Office of Military Affairs (DCHA/OMA) in USAID/Washington, and will be supported and assisted by the relevant bureau representatives through the Office of Military Affairs Working Group.   

For day-to-day cooperation and guidance, the PSC will report to and come under the support, an appointed senior representative of the Director of the SOCOM JIACG.  The Director/JIACG will ensure the provision of support services for the PSC.  The Director, JIACG will provide access and interface to units and officers deemed essential to build a strong working relationship between USAID and SOCOM.  The PSC will also coordinate closely with the State Department Political Advisor (the POLAD) in SOCOM, providing information and input that would help State operations and ensure a close working relationship with the Ambassadors in the respective regions.  

The PSC tasks shall include, but not be limited to:

1.  Coordinate the evaluation, review and development of SOCOM and USAID assistance programs and plans deemed of mutual interest and objectives within the SOCOM area of operations.  This would include Theater Security Cooperation Plans, Information Operations Plans, emerging Stability Operations proposals, and USAID mission annual and sectoral planning documentation, among others as appropriate.  The Security Cooperation Plans represent DOD’s annual planning and budget document for most non-warfare programs.  The PSC will link together USAID’s regional bureau headquarters and their field missions with the SOCOM planning groups so that programs and budgets are developed that reinforce and support joint objectives and approaches in the region.  (25%)

2.  The PSC will lead or facilitate the evaluation and development of USAID assistance programs of mutual interest that may lie outside of the Theater Security Cooperation Plan.  Of particular importance will be the development of Stability Operations plans and programs.

5.  The PSC will develop a network of working relationships between USAID and the US military as relevant to SOCOM’s area of operation, with a focus on USAID field missions and key USAID contractors and grantees working with SOCOM.  This will include assistance on the negotiation of effective working relationships in the field between the NGO community and the military.  Contacts in the US military will be guided by SOCOM, and should include relevant US and overseas training, pre-deployment and support units; key policy and support groups and leaders in the Pentagon, with point persons in Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); and other COCOMs including their USAID liaison officers.  The PSC will also develop relationships with other key donors and partners working in the region, including NATO, UN organizations, and other country militaries as recommended by SOCOM and OMA.  (20%)

6.  The PSC will advise the OMA on guidance, doctrine, systems development and other organizational development tools needed to codify and strengthen the long-term development of USAID’s interface with the US military.  In doing this, the PSC will seek input from other COCOM representatives to discern lessons learned from other regions. (10%)

7.  The PSC will prepare monthly reports summarizing activities of the concluding month and planned activities over the next month, to be circulated to all appropriate SOCOM officers and to USAID OMA, regional bureaus (AFR, E&E and ANE), field missions within the SOCOM area of responsibility, the USAID Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (PPC), and others as directed by OMA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is 60029 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.     This is not a small business set-aside. 

The National Institute on Drug Abuse on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has a requirement for proteomic typing.  The Neuro-immunology Branch of the Division of Intramural Program (DIR) at the NINDS, NIH is conducting a proteomics study of specimens derived from a multi-center clinical trial with goals to identify protein markers of multiple sclerosis (MS).
     
Proteomic techniques aimed at biomarker discovery have been centered on identification of differentially expressed proteins following gel or liquid chromatographic separation.  The candidate biomarker is then evaluated by immunoassay for population-wide sensitivity and specificity at detection.  This two step approach is proven to be effective and has been greatly enhanced by the sequencing of the human genome and concomitant improvements in mass spectroscopy.  However, a significant number of the biomarkers initially identified using this approach will fail in the population studies.  2D-gel analysis has been the proteomic tool of choice, with systems now routinely analyzing 10s of gels simultaneously.  However, in addition to the need for high-throughput, there is a tremendous need for improved ability to mine the full depth of the proteome.  Methodology that can accommodate higher-throughput with the ability to observe high volume of protein events are needed to advance clinical proteomics.  Currently, many systems that couple robotic handling of samples in the front-end to a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer can fulfill this need.  

This work entails the serum protein profiling and protein identification of samples from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls obtained from a large multicenter trial (BioMS) designed to identify candidate biomarkers in MS.   An examination of abundant and less abundant proteins will be required using high-throughput, selective affinity approaches using high-resolution MALDI-TOF (Bruker ClinProt UltraFlex™ MALDI-TOF/TOF preferred). All samples will be examined both as whole proteins and as trypsinized protein samples. Identification of differentially expressed proteins from samples is desired.  All data will be mined and analyzed using appropriate bioinformatics tools.  Both raw and analyzed data will be delivered in a specified format and within time frames listed below.  

1). The facility must be equipped with high resolution of MALDI-TOF (Bruker ClinProt UltraFlex™ MALDI-TOF/TOF preferred) and have an established track record in clinical proteomics with peer-reviewed journal publications in this area.  
2). An initial pilot study (study 1) with approximately 150-200 samples will be performed. Within 30 days of receipt of the initial study 1 samples, profile spectra (at least one spectrum per sample) will be delivered to the Principal Investigator.  
3). A larger more comprehensive study (study 2) will involve all the baseline data and will include approximately 600-800 patient samples and approximately 200 control samples.   For study 2 the contractor will provide both profile raw spectra and protein identifications (i.e. approximate mass/charge values if not protein function/name identification) of those proteins that distinguish patients from healthy controls.  
4). In addition, a patient only study (study 3) may be initiated of a before and after taking drugs comparison to include a maximum of 600-800 patients at two time points (i.e. 1200-1600 total samples). Within 120 days of receipt of samples for study 2 or study 3, profile spectra will be delivered to the PI.  For study 3 the goal will be to identify what protein expression is associated with positive or negative response to the drug regimens.  
5). All samples will be distributed to the facility from a central sample repository site.  The facility must have the ability to track the specimens related information (specimen ID, date received, amount used, remaining amount, storage location, etc.) received from the sample distribution center and allows the PI to query samples and create reports.

As described in the previous section, the first set of results must be submitted to the PI within 30 days of receipt of the initial study 1 samples (150-200 samples) with profile spectra (at least one spectrum per sample) and an analysis of the data.  The second and third sets of results are to be submitted to the PI within 120 days of receipt of each set of samples and again, with raw profile spectra and an analysis of the data.

<DESC>This amendment is for solicitation numbers 246-06-Q-0034A, 246-06-Q-0034B and 246-06-Q-0034C.  The following questions were received from interested sources.  Answers provided by the Project Officer follow each question:
1. In regards to the PACS portion of the solicitation, is the group (Lawton USPHS Indian Hospital)interested in receiving proposals from PACS vendors such as BRIT Systems, in this case would compete with Ramsoft, or are they only targeting Ramsoft distributors to get the best price for a Ramsoft solution? We (Lawton USPHS Indian Hospital) would prefer RAMSOFT as our PAC System.
2. A list of all the modalities that are expected to send images to the archive as well as the current DICOM classes they support (Do they each support DICOM Store and DICOM Modality Work List? Do they support one and not the other?) This information will determine the integration and components required to acquire images.  ANSWER: A List of modalities: a. 1 - 16 slice Digital CT (will support latest Dicom Classes); b. 1 - DR (part of lease); c. 4 - CR (part of lease); d. 2 - US (needs digital upgrade, will support latest Dicom Classes); e. 4 - Imagers (part of lease); f. 1 - Radiologist Workstation (part of lease); g. 2 - Administrative Workstation (part of lease); h. 31- Clinical Workstations (part of lease); i. 1 - HIS/RIS gateway (part of lease); j. 2 - Digitizers (part of lease).
3. Does each site have a Hospital Information System (HIS)? YES, are they expected to enter orders and patient demographics in that system and integrate to the PACS? YES. Or, will each site require a RIS product? NO. If a site has a HIS system that will need to be integrated, what type is it? RPMS. And does it support HL-7? YES.
4. At each of the sites, will the radiologists continue to dictate the way they currently do? NO. Will they be interested in upgrading to a different product for dictation? Voice Activated Dictation will need to be included in Radiologist Workstation and PACS Software. This information will determine what type of voice dictation to expect to integrate with, or initiate the proposal of a new dictation solution.
5. At each site, what application is used for billing (what vendor and model)? VA 3RD Party Billing System V 2.5. Since the RIS/PACS solution will need to integrate to the billing applications (perhaps the billing is part of the HIS?) YES. 
6. What are the bandwidth specifications between all 3 sites? We have a dedicated T1 at each facility. 
The RFQ closing date of June 2, 2006, is not changed by this amendment.

<DESC>13. "The CCS shall be capable of being shipped via common carrier without special handling or packaging. The system, including the batteries, shall not need to be classified as hazardous material per 49 CFR Part 173."

This requirement, if strictly interpreted, will effectively preclude the use of Lithium ion batteries in the portable units, thereby increasing their weight and substantially reducing
the available battery run time.

It is also likely to increase the cost of the system significantly.

To meet the above solicitation requirement, is it acceptable to ship the portable units individually, and to impose the requirement that the boxes be labeled in accordance with
existing regulations? Further, can the definition of "shipping" be limited to common carriers within the US and its possessions, since international requirements for Lithium ion batteries are much more strict than US requirements?

Answer: Our interpretation of 49 CFR Part 173 is that rechargeable lithium ion batteries are not hazardous material and do not warrant special handling or packaging. Shipping is defined at the continental United States and it's territories.

<DESC>This Amendment does not change the date that offers are due. The purpose of this Amendment is to (A) replace language in section 11.0 of the Statement of Work in 06PR-TDP-312; and, the purpose of this amendment is to (B) post answers to questions regarding the solicitation.

(A) Remove and replace:

Remove from section 11.0
A time and material contract award is anticipated.

Replace with
A firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contract award is anticipated.

(B)

Questions and answers as of May 25, 2006:

Question #1

Will a team that includes subcontractors with specialized expertise be considered?

Answer: Yes. A team that includes subcontractors will be considered.

Question #2

Must any of the team members be located in the Washington D.C. area? If the team lead is available to travel to D.C. as required, can the majority of the work (writing, media contact, etc.) be done virtually?

Answer: No person is required to be located in Washington DC. However, the duties of the position (see 5.5 of Statement of Work) sometimes require the contractor to be in Washington DC. It is estimated that the contractor will need to be in Washington D.C. 12 to 15 times per year.

Question #3

Does the annual report entail any design, or is it strictly text and data?

Answer: The annual report is more than text and data. I would recommend that you look to the IRS Oversight Board web site for examples. (www.treas.gov/irsob)

Question #4

How long is the annual report and what type of format is typically produced?

Answer: The last three annual reports have been 2005 (48), 2004 (49), and 2003 (30) pages long. Examples of the format produced can be found on the IRS Board web site previously referenced.

Question #5

Should travel expenses be incorporated into the proposal, or should expenses be estimated separately and billed at cost?

Answer: Travel expenses should be incorporated into the proposal and Travel should be reimbursed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. The applicable regulations can be found at www.gsa/ftr.gov .

Question #6

Is there a preferred format in which you would like to receive our response to this bid?
 
Answer: There is no preferred format for the response. Please see FAR 52.212-1 for instructions for offerors.

Question #7

Do we need to provide estimated costs for the 4 option years?

Answer: Yes.

Question #8

Should past performance references be federal government agencies or, since my company has not worked for the federal government before, will other client references be accepted?

Answer: Past performance references are not restricted to federal government agencies. All references will be evaluated.

Question #9

I would also be interested in learning when you expect to make a decision and award a contract, if you have that information and can you share it. 

Answer: There is no definitive date set for decision and award. Under simplified acquisition procedures, unsuccessful offerors are not required to be notified. (See FAR 13.106-3) If you desire to be notified, please request notification in writing.

Question #10

How many “additional reports”, as stated in the solicitation, are expected?

Answer: The number of additional reports varies from year to year. Due to the difficulty in predicting circumstances that may warrant a need to produce an additional report, any response to this question would be mere speculation; and, therefore no number will be provided. Reports that were completed in past years are available on the IRS Oversight Board web site.

Question #11

Will you need assistance in planning/producing the Board meetings, either within the Oversight Board’s offices or those held elsewhere?

Answer: The statement of work contained in the body of the combined synopsis/solicitation details the responsibility of the contractor regarding Board meetings.

Question #12 

Will Contractors be given an opportunity to meet with the Program Officer?

Answer: No

Question #13

Will select Contractors be given an opportunity to present their proposal and examples of their work in person?

Answer: No Contractor, select or otherwise, will be given an opportunity to present their proposal beyond their submission as required in the solicitation.

Question #14

Are you looking for an hourly rate and estimate of time and materials on deliverables mentioned? I would imagine that we would include an hourly rate for any additional work that falls outside of this scope. If this be the case, then I would presume that you aren't looking for a "firm fixed price" quotation? 

Answer:  The solicitation is for commercial items which require a firm fixed price contract per the Federal Acquisition Regulation; therefore any quote should reflect this requirement.

Question #15

“Generic” I think there may be something that can be done better or additionally in the requirement. Should I propose this?

Answer: Your quote should reflect the requirements of the solicitation. However, you are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the Government’s requirement with the understanding that the Government will select the offer that is most advantageous, price and other factors considered. See FAR 52.212-1 & -2

Question #16

Should the proposal include print management and cost of printing? Or just the cost for us to manage printing with print cost being separate and quoted once piece is designed?

Answer: Printing is done by the Department of Treasury; but the contractor develops the specifications for printing, including type of paper, use of color, binding, quantify, and other parameters of the job. The actual cost of printing is not borne by the contractor.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate answers to questions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation.

Q:  What is the duration of the interview in minutes.   
A:  Estimated duration is around 20 minutes.

Q:  A list of 400 names will be supplied by CDC. Are these respondents aware of the study and have they agreed to participate? 
A:  No, persons have not been contacted. 

Q:  If 400 names are provided it is unlikely we will get more than 20-30% (optimistically), is there a desire to get a minimum number of these respondents to answer the survey? 
A:  We will provide lists of ongoing cases detected by the surveillance system. We will continue to provide lists until the desired sample size has been reached. 

Q:  Another 200 respondents will be dialed randomly. What are the qualifying criteria for these respondents?  Aware of Dengue Infection?  Have previously had Dengue Infection? 
A:  Verbal screening test for dengue will take place. These 200 respondents should not have current or recent dengue infection.
 
Q:  Are there other demographic requirements such as % of male / female?  location? etc. 
A:  200 respondents will be matched by town to the persons with dengue infections. No requirements for % male or female. 

Q:  What is the assumed incidence of respondents to qualify for the survey? 
A:  The response rate based on pilot study and previous experience is expected to be excellent (>90%). 

Q:  When is the study commence?  
A:  As soon as the contract is awarded and in accordance with the times in the synopsis. 

Q:  The study will utilize a questionnaire that will be developed and provided by CDC investigators. How is the questionnaire defined? Open or closed answers? 
A:  Both.
 
Q:  How many questions are included in the questionnaire? 
A:  166 questions approximately but it has a skip pattern throughout the questionnaire so not all the questions will be asked in a given interview. 

Q:  How is considered a questionnaire which is not 100% completed; considering that the interviewed person may not wish to provide answers to all the questions? 
A:  Not all questions need to be answered. A person may decide not to answer some of the questions, particularly sensitive questions but if most of the questionnaire is answered, this will be considered a completed interview. 
 
Q:  Please confirm if the sample size of 600 persons is the sum of the 400 persons listed by the CDC plus the 200 persons from the control group. 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How many persons will be re-contacted in the second set?
A:  All the persons contacted in the initial set. 
   
Q:  Which is the difference in the second questionnaire from the first one? 
A:  Almost identical questionnaire.
 
Q:   How is the questionnaire defined? Open or closed answers? 
A:  Both.

Q:  How will the  identification criteria be applied? Is it related to the data gathering method or is it related to the characteristics necessary to include a person in the control group?
A:   Criteria to identify 400 persons will be applied by CDC to obtain the lists that will be provided to the vendor. 
 
Q:  What will be done if the persons in the list provided by the CDC can not be reached? (Wrong phone number, does not agree to answer, etc.) Will the survey be completed with the contacted persons regardless of the contacts obtained in the list group or will the control group size be adjusted? 
A:  Additional lists will be provided until the desired sample size has been reached.

Q:  Will specific amount of persons that the vendor will have to interview as part of the control group by municipality? Please confirm.
A:  Yes.
 
Q:  Which are your preferences in terms of quotation for this service: by labor hours or by questionnaire completed? It is important to clarify this question because if there are any changes to the questionnaire or the method of interview the results or the amount of hours necessary to complete the survey will be affected. If so, will it be issued an adjustment to the purchase order in terms of volume? 
A:  By questionnaire completed. Only minor changes are expected. The duration of the interview should not change significantly.

Q:  Do you have a forecast of the period length to achieve the 400 persons in the list to be provided by the CDC? 
A:  This will depend on the rate on which cases accrue but we estimate about 9 months to identify and complete the first interviews of 400 persons.

Q:  Which is the frequency in which the CDC will provide lists? Will they be partial lists?
A:   Lists can be provided on a weekly basis. Yes, they will be partial lists.

Q:  Do you have an estimated date for the beginning of the 400 persons list build up?
A:   As soon as the contract is awarded.

Q:  Is there any specific format to submit the quotation?
A:  No

1.3.  SPECIFIC TASKS

1.3.1.	REQUIREMENTS.  The requirements specified in this SOW are subject to periods of fluctuation as mission and personnel requirements change.  Therefore, quantities and delivery schedules are not static and are subject to change.  Each organization will establish/maintain individual requirement quantities and delivery schedules.

1.3.4.   HAZARDOUS WASTE.

B.	The Contractor shall handle all hazardous waste in accordance with all legal and regulatory requirements; including, but not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (R.C.R.A., 40 C.F.R. §240-299).  In addition, the Contractor shall:
 
1.	Provide monthly report showing the proper disposal of hazardous material to include manifests with authorized signatures.

1.4.3.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE.  Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times while operating a motor vehicle on base.  Montana state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Malmstrom AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Security Forces personnel for failure to comply.

In addition, all vehicle operators, both military and civilian, driving personal or government-owned vehicles on Malmstrom AFB are prohibited from using a cell phone unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  Also, the wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB is prohibited.  Violation of this policy may affect your driving privileges, as each violation will result in the loss of three (3) points.

Additionally, any persons found speeding while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB shall be subject to the same suspensions.  Repeated offenses will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on the Contractor’s ability to perform agreement requirements.

1.5.  PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.  The contractor must identify a Project Manager and alternate who is able to address issues and concerns that may arise during the performance of this agreement.

1.6.	INVOICES AND PAYMENTS.  The Contractor shall submit invoices by the 10th of each month for services rendered the previous month.  Each organization will pay respective invoices by Government Purchase Card.
