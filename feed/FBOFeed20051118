<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The National Response Plan designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical responses to man-made or natural disasters.  The HHS Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was established in 2002.  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect the American population from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.  Specifically, the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) within OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in preparation for a public health emergency response.  
DESCRIPTION:   The purpose of this notice is to indicate that HHS anticipates publishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition of product on or after December 5, 2005.  The Department of Health and Human Services has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of therapeutic products to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic disruptions associated with Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  ARS, also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by radiation delivered to the whole body (or a large proportion of the body) over a period of seconds to days. In addition ingested, inhaled, or absorbed radioisotopes could also produce ARS. There are several blood-cell types that are primarily affected in ARS including white cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes), red cells, and platelets.  The significant decrease of neutrophils (called neutropenia) significantly increases an individual’s susceptibility to lethal infections.  Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia, (a lack of platelets and red blood cells respectively) can significantly increase an individual’s risk for bleeding (at platelet levels <20,000/uL) or tissue ischemia due to loss of oxygen carrying capacity, respectively.  The current requirement is for the acquisition of up to 100,000 treatment courses of medical countermeasures to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic syndrome associated with ARS; THE TREATMENTS TO BE ACQUIRED MUST MITIGATE AND/OR TREAT NEUTROPENIA. Following whole body radiation exposure in the 2 – 6 Gy range, treatment of neutropenia is the most critical clinical requirement and thus Offerors’ product(s) must mitigate and/or treat neutropenia associated with ARS. Medical countermeasures that both treat and/or mitigate the other components of the hematopoetic syndrome and/or the gastrointestinal syndrome of ARS are of interest to the USG. The gastrointestinal syndrome facilitates the transmigration of the intestinal flora placing patients with neutropenia at increased risk of life-threatening bacteremia and sepsis.  The Technical Evaluation Criteria to be published in the RFP will establish a scoring system whereby those products that can address additional components of ARS in addition to neutropenia (including thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, GI syndrome, etc.) will be given additional points.  This acquisition is based on the availability of funds.
  
The RFP to be issued will be on the basis of full and open competition.  Subcontracting with small and small disadvantaged business is encouraged.  All Offerors with a candidate product or products for the mitigation and/or treatment of neutropenia alone or neutropenia in combination with one or more additional components of ARS that meet the Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility specified in the RFP are encouraged to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  
The Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility will include:
Product(s) that treat the neutropenia associated with ARS.  Neutropenia will be defined as a reduction in neutrophils (granulocytes) meeting one of the following criteria:
•	Moderate <1000 neutrophils/uL
•	Severe <500 neutrophils/uL
The Government reserves the right to make single or multiple contract awards.  It is anticipated that up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses may be acquired under SEPARATE RFP(s) at a later date, contingent on the availability of funds.  
The RFP will be released on GSA FEDBIZOPPS website (www.fbo.gov).  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>United States Special Operations is seeking industry comments on a proposed strategy and draft Statement of Work (SOW) to acquire a production ready, SOF Deployable Node, Medium (SDN-M).  This announcement is a request for comment only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The RFP will posted on Fed Biz Ops and shall likely be designated as a small business set aside since the corresponding market investigation determined that multiple small businesses were capable of satisfying this requirement.  The NAICS Code is 334220. The primary objective of the SDN-M program is to leverage ongoing industry initiatives/commercial items in the area of Internet Protocol (IP) based SATCOM   technologies to satisfy SDN-M performance/operational requirements without a Government funded development program.  The SDN-M requirement is to procure up to 109 non-developmental, commercially available, transit case configured, Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) for satellite communications in the Ku frequency band. 

The basis for contract award shall be BEST VALUE, with evaluation factors consisting of technical, past performance and cost/price.  The technical evaluation will assess both the written proposal and an Initial Production System (IPS) demonstration at a Government designated facility.  The RFP will identify the IPS demonstration set-up, procedures, and performance parameters that will be assessed as part of Source Selection. Each offeror shall provide an operational IPS for evaluation comprised of their VSAT terminal (not exceeding 1 meter in aperture) and an integrated environmentally protected iDirect modem supporting Internet Protocol (IP) satellite transport.  In addition to shared resource IP-based communications such as hub-spoke Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) protocols, the integral modem shall provide a bypass mode supporting Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) functionality.  The purpose of the IPS demonstration is to assess the technical maturity of the product proposed and the realism of the offeror’s proposed schedule for delivery of production test articles.  The IPS must possess all of the required INTELSAT certifications prior to the IPS demonstration.  If the IPS does not include all the baseline performance parameters as described in the SOW, then the offeror shall explain in its technical proposal what additional effort is required to fully implement those parameter(s).  Additional capabilities exceeding the SDN-M baseline requirements that are proposed for delivery in the SDN-M first production units, must be included in the IPS demonstration.  Instructions will be provided in the RFP regarding the location and time of the IPS demonstration.  

The Government anticipates, upon conclusion of source selection, the award of a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year hardware ordering period and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  The USSOCOM requirement is for up to 109 SDN-M production systems, training, and ancillary equipment and spares.   

Potential offerors are invited to review and comment on this strategy and the draft SOW within 15 days of this announcement.  The draft SOW is available electronically on the Fed Biz Ops Web Site.

<DESC>The Missile defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman (NG) to develop discrimination and battle management technologies in support of the Project Hercules mission.  Since 2000, NG has worked to develop an extensive suite of clutter-suppression algorithms and architecture based on 25 years of NG prior experience with BMD and the design, development, and integration experience gained from the existing 5-year contract.  At least a one year delay would result if a different team took over this work and attempted to understand and improve upon all the many aspects of these algorithms and their interrelationship when connected in a suite.  NG has performed critical functions and used its unique blend of Red Dog, pre-Red Dog (Red Tigress and other missions at RTS), and current flight test design, planning, and analysis and system engineering experience in the successful design of the Red Dog flight test. NG prepared the original system-level requirements for payloads and the requirements for sensor participation and sensor observations (data collection).  NG provided system engineering and design guidance to the HardFac in the development of the two novel payloads it prepared for Red Dog Flight 1-B.  NG reduced and analyzed sensor data post-mission to characterize the payloads in their operation, to anchor the Corporate Clutter Working Group (CCWG) simulation model SigSim to the data collected, and to modify and extend CCWG mitigation algorithms.  This flight was directly relevant to clutter-suppression algorithms whereby NG gained valuable experience that cannot be duplicated elsewhere.  As a follow on to Red Dog, a key upcoming test is scheduled for FY06 to test Project Hercules clutter suppression algorithms.  NG is applying expertise in the planning of FT06-4 (CMCM-4).  That campaign will provide an opportunity for a real-time demonstration of one or more CCWG. The institutional expertise and lessons learned from Red Dog, make it unfeasible for another company to meet this stringent schedule.  See Note 22.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

6. Reason for Sole Source/Limited Sources:

(   )  Only one source (unique capabilities)
( X )  Proprietary drawings, specifications, and/or engineering
       data, patents, copyrights
(   )  Brand Name essential to the Government’s needs.
(   )  Standardization Program supported by Agency Head
       Determination and Findings (D&F).
(   )  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (limited sources)

 Briefly Explain:

1. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to issue a firm fixed price contract to Ideal
Electronic Security CO. who will obtain through  SI-TEX Marine Electronics, Inc. thirteen (13) Direction Finder Standard Antenna Assemblies, p/n IES-LA-73.  This part is in support of the IES-KDF-538, Direction Finder used onboard various Coast Guard cutter platforms.

2.	When the original item was procured by USCG Headquarters there were no requirements 
specified for manufacturer engineering drawings, test procedures, or test specifications.  According to Ideal Electronic Security CO, the antennas were not developed with USCG funds. Because the USCG did not acquire rights to the antennas, the technical data regarding the subject hardware is proprietary to Ideal Electronic Security CO.

3.	FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), permits contracting for supplies
or services when the supplies or services required by the agency are deemed available only from the original source(s) for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment. These antennas are part of a specialized equipment necessary to provide basic mariner safety.


4.	In accordance with FAR 7.101, the USCG conducted a market research utilizing the
       World Wide Web, Thomas Registers’ Manuals, Commercial Catalog, Federal Supply 
       Schedules, National Stock Numbers (NSN), etc. in order to locate as many capable sources
       for the antennas as possible. There was only one company that can supply the antennas to the
       USCG, Ideal Electronic Security CO, Wash, D.C.  According to the USCG, Engineering 
       Logistics Center, Ideal Electronic Security CO is the sole-source manufacturer capable of 
       supplying the antennas without long-term development.

7.	Impact to the Government if not awarded in accordance with
   The above: If the USCG is unable to obtain replacement antenna assemblies compatible 
       to the original IES-KDF-538 equipment, it will be forced to recapitalize the entire IES-
       KDF-538 equipment population as they fail.  This would lead to a lack of adequate spares 
       and would greatly decrease the Coast Guard’s capabilities of monitoring VHF and  
       emergency distress beacon transmissions, in turn reducing it’s ability to respond adequately 
       to it’s lifesaving missions.

(    )  Standardization Program supported by Agency Head
         Determination and Findings (D&F).
(    )  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (limited sources)

Briefly Explain:  
       1.  FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) (B), For DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements for enhanced HF communications. This procurement will allow the purchase of CG/URC-1 (V) piece parts. These piece parts are available from Sunair Electron-ics, Inc. only.

2.   In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3) (i) the USCG conducted a market research utilizing the World Wide Web, Thomas Registers’, Manuals,  other vendor’s Commercial Catalogs and GSA Supply Schedules, in order to locate as many capable sources of supply for these radios as possible. The only vendors located are the OEM, Sunair Electronics, Inc,

7.  Impact to the Government if not awarded in accordance with the above:  
All parts must be physically the same in form, fit and function as the already supported CG/URC-1 (V). Any deviation from this standard will significantly increase the cost for support and will adversely impact the United States Coast Guard (USCG) command and control communications, interoperability with DHS agencies, Joint Military Operations and communications with the boating public. This system also supports law enforcement, search and rescue, migrant interdiction and environmental protection. This procurement will ensure that the pipeline is fully populated to accommodate the demand and keep the availability of the CG/URC-1 (V) on track as the HF Low Power Re-placement Project, (HFLP) continues. The (HFLP) Replacement project will improve communications capabilities Coast Guard wide.

<CONTACT>Michael Dixon (703) 432-4224 Valerie Mosqueira: (703) 432-4127 or Valerie.Mosqueira@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to procure on a sole source basis, software development, systems integration, and support services for the Target Location, Designation and Hand-Off System (TLDHS) from Stauder Technologies, Inc., 115 Mexico Court, Suite D, St. Peters, MO. 63376.  The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) for the software development and integration, Time and Materials (T&M) for engineering services, and Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) for production options contract is anticipated.  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $12,006,000.00.  The Period of Performance is from FY 06 through FY 10 (five years).  The proposed contract action is to complete development and testing of TLDHS Block II and extend the Block II functionality to integrate n!  aval surface fires through the use of Naval Fire Control Systems (NFCS).  This effort encompasses support of software requirements, design, development, documentation, integration, and testing on the TLDHS.  It will allow continued development of TLDHS Block II software to maintain compatibility with other digital systems as those systems continue to upgrade and change their interfaces.  Stauder Technologies has developed and implemented unique algorithms in their software package.  This development has resulted in an original system whose function cannot be duplicated by any existing package or by a modification to any existing package.  The Government does not have the source code for TLDHS and therefore cannot provide it with a solicitation.  As a result of Stauder Technologies’ extensive experience, any competition would result in unrecoverable, extensive duplication of cost.  Moreover, award of the TLDHS development and support contract to any other source would result!   in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements and co uld upset the present program schedule by introducing unknown variables and schedule risk.  Based on the years taken to develop this capability to date, it is not expected that another source could step in, replicate the capability, test and field and remain on track for the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) in April 2006 and successfully support and pass the OT&E event.  Currently the Government does not have a technical data package which includes software.  No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding. However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement. All communications shall be in writing. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI),Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Ms. Patricia E. Davis, 13907 Lullaby Road, Germantown, Maryland 20874, to provide acquisition expert consultant services.  STATEMENT OF WORK: Specifically, the Contractor shall perform pre-award contract specialist work from the point of receiving a new initiative to award.  The work entails creating an Acquisition Plan/Request for Contract, preparing the independent government cost estimate, preparing the Request for Proposal, responding to offeror;s questions, participating in peer review, documenting the competitive range, negotiating with potential offerors documenting the source selection decision, obtaining clearances, documenting the contract file, and writing the contract.  Many of these tasks are done collaboratively with the project officer.  The consultant shall present her recommendations to an NHLBI, COAC Contracting Officer and in no way shall bind the government to a course of action.  While performing these task, Ms. Davis shall provide on-the-job training to other Contract Specialist as requested.  In addition she will serve as a liaison between a new Project Officers from NHLBI’s COAC Customer Institute, helping with writing statements of work, justifications and evaluation criteria. Ms. Davis shall perform pre-solicitation and pre-award contract file reviews.   This project is expected to required 384 man hours during the period of performance, beginning the date of award and for approximately six (6) months for an average of two (2) days (16 hours) per week.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise associated with Ms. Davis’s 30 years of employment with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in acquisitions.  Ms. Davis has extensive knowledge and experience of all phases of the NHLBI research  contract process.  She is familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and NIH/NHLBI contracting policy procedures and practices used within the COAC.   Ms. Davis has extensive experience in clinical trials and epidemiology studies.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) First Stage. This effort will encompass the design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E), including long lead items for the initial production of CLV First Stage. The First Stage will be a reusable solid rocket booster (SRB) stage derived from the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) SRB. The activities include design, development, and flight testing of the CLV First Stage and long lead materials for a follow-on production.  Pursuant to FAR 6.302.1(a), NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Alliant Tech Systems (ATK) Thiokol Propulsion, 9160 N. Hwy 83, Brigham City, UT, 84302.  Only ATK possesses the facilities, manufacturing capability, and current engineering and manufacturing work force to successfully manufacture the CLV First Stage as a single prime contractor in the DDT&E phase.  ATK is the only source for a large human-rated, reusable solid propellant motor. ATK owns the facilities where the RSRMs are refurbished and manufactured in Utah. No other facilities exist that can refurbish or manufacture the RSRM. ATK maintains unique and specific design, processing, and testing knowledge and capability required to ensure the reliability required for large-scale human-rated solid rocket booster systems.  The production effort for First Stage will be a separate procurement.  However, long lead items are included in this effort to support the production of First Stage beyond the DDT&E effort. These long lead items will be considered Government Furnished Property (GFP) for the production procurement.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications, and approach to produce the CLV First Stage to include signed teaming arrangements in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 2, 2005. Such information will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact ATK directly.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<CONTACT>Patrick W. Lorton Contract Specialist 2083875717     Patrick_Lorton@nifc.blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to acquire 20 each DC-7 parachutes, 11 each MT-1S reserve parachutes, and 11 each MT-1S Deployment Systems.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Para-Flite, Inc., 5800 Magnolia Avenue, Pennsauken, NJ 08109 who owns the patent rights to these items.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following specification applies to the DC-7 parachute requirement: The parachute canopy shall be 375 square feet to accommodate a payload ranging from 220-300 pounds and be capable of reaching at least 20 miles per hour forward speed.  The parachute shall be capable of achieving descent rates of 0-10 feet per second in no wind conditions using a static deep brake setting. Slotted stabilizer bars are required for good slow speed performance and stability.  A span wise constructed seam is required in order to fit a canopy of this size into the required development bags and containers. The color scheme shall be as follows: (a) Top Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the second span of fabric shall be white, the third span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (b) Bottom Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the 2nd span of fabric shall be fire red, the 3rd span of fabric shall be white, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 5th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (c) End cells shall be fire red; (d) Ribs shall be fire red; (e) Stabilizers shall be fire red; (f) Slider shall be fire red. The MT-1S reserve parachute is 280 square feet and has a pack volume of 745 cubic inches. This parachute is the only ram-air reserve chute meeting the BLM requirements for fitting the reserve container and meeting all testing requirements of the BLM Smokejumper program. The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $75,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 314999 and SIC code 2399 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAQ062001.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost including R&D requirements and full technical certifications and testing.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by November 28, 2005 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Para-Flite, Inc. for the requirements stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Patrick Lorton at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 56132 	The Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters Office in Washington DC  is presently interested in soliciting request for quotes (RFQ) from vendors to provide Temporary Help Services to complete a critical need by assisting the Agriculture Branch with the annual  mailing of reporting forms to pesticide-producing and device-producing establishments so they may meet the requirements of Section 7 of the federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). 		If you have any questions or need clarification, please forward your questions to the Project  Officer above.  All responses must be addressed in writing to US EPA, Joanne Bullock (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202)565-2554, Attn: Joanne Bullock, or sent by email to bullock.joanne@epa.gov. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing  no later than Nov. 28, 2005. Please include your name, point of contact, address, area code and telephone number, and facsimile number, tax ID number, indicate whether you are a small or large business; woman or minority owned; 8(a), GSA schedule, or open market. Telephone requests or inquiries  will not be accepted. 	STATEMENT OF WORK TITLE:		Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), SECTION 7 - ANNUAL SOLICITATION OF PESTICIDE PRODUCING FIRMS. BACKGROUND:	The Agriculture Branch/Agriculture Division within the Office of Compliance/Office of Enforcement and  Compliance Assurance annually prepares for mailing approximately 11,000 envelopes containing the information necessary for reporting the production of pesticide products.  The purpose of this mailing is to assure compliance with the statutory requirement that each Pesticide Producing Establishment  reports the amount of pesticides produced for each year.  EPA regulations require these reports to be made available using EPA supplied forms.  In cooperation with various EPA Offices but coordinated by the Agriculture Branch, envelopes are prepared with pre-addressed labels, stuffed with written  materials, and prepared for mailing.  Each envelope will contain:  1) copies of instructions for completing the EPA Form 3540-16, 2) the EPA Form 3540-16, 3) Letter of introduction, 4) Pesticide Producing firm site address labels and 5) guidance describing scenarios on how to report common  occurrences in producing establishments. 			Since this task requires that accurate and complete packages be sent to each of the recipients (pesticide companies), the services of employees who are competent, possess the ability to read well and understand processes, etc. is essential.   Additionally, persons may be required to move envelopes (in small quantities) from one location in a room to another pre-prescribed location within that room (i.e., from a work table surface to a box on the floor or on the table). WORK LOCATION:	 			All work is to be performed onsite at EPA's  business location listed below because of the mass of papers/materials involved in compiling this mailout activity. 			The work will be performed at EPA's Ariel Rios Building, 12th Street & 			Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Room 6104-South.  A conference room along with tables and chairs will be  provided for the work site.  No food or drink may be consumed in this room.			 			Individuals reporting to work shall report to Michelle Stevenson at (202) 564-4203. 			Public transportation to the work location is available in the form of METRO Bus or METRO Rail to the Federal Triangle  stop. 			Entrance to the Ariel Rios building is through doors identified "United States Environmental Protection Agency" located adjacent to the Federal Triangle Metro escalators.   WORK HOURS:	8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. 			Monday - Friday with 1 hour for Lunch. DATES OF PROPOSED  WORK:		START:  	Monday, December 5, 2005 at 8:00 a.m. and  						END: 	Friday, December 16, 2005 at 5:00 p.m.    TASKS TO BE COMPLETED: 		From various sorted separate stacks of information each person will be required to take:  one copy of an Instruction Sheet, one copy of an introductory Letter,  as many copies of EPA Form 3540-16 as there are establishments for a particular company [establishment site labels (gummed labels) go on the right side of form in blocks 8-13], guidance describing scenarios on how to report common occurrences in producing establishments, materials from the  Agriculture Compliance Assistance center, the appropriate Pesticide Producing firm site labels (these labels can be easily associated with the "company" envelope since each have preprinted corresponding numbers), place site labels on forms, and place them into an appropriate "company's" envelope.   Each envelope will then be addressed with an appropriate pre-addressed company mailing label specific to the group of pesticide producing firms contained within the envelope.  The envelope will then be sealed.  In order to seal the envelop either tape and/or tube type wetters will be provided.   Once each envelope is stuffed, sealed and addressed it will be set aside for mailing.  The same process, as described above, will be used for subsequent envelopes.  (EPA Staff will be available to instruct the contractor on the proper way to stuff envelopes with the required information as listed  under this Task).

TITLE:  Commander's Predictive Environment – Understand the Battleship

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER:  BAA # 06-07-IFKA

CFDA Number:  12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 19 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Jun 06; and FY 08 by 1 Jun 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 07, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.  

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The objective of the Commander's Predictive Environment (CPE) program is to provide a decision support environment that enables the Joint Force Commander / Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFC/JFACC) to anticipate and shape the future battlespace.  As envisioned, CPE will have four key capabilities: 1) Understand the Battlespace, 2) Anticipate Plausible Futures, 3) Evaluate Courses of Action, and 4) Access and Share Battlespace Information.  This BAA specifically addresses the first key capability, "Understand the Battlespace."

To assist in understanding the battlespace, a System-of-Systems Analysis (SoSA) views the battlespace as an interrelated system of Political, Military, Economic, Social, Information, and Infrastructure (PMESII) dimensions.  The process attempts to 1) Model and analyze adversaries, self, and neutrals as a complex adaptive system; 2) Understand key relationships, dependencies, and vulnerabilities of adversary/self/neutrals; and 3) Identify leverage points that represent opportunities to influence capabilities, perceptions, decision making, and behavior.

PMESII model development is currently a time-consuming activity.  Skilled analysts build detailed, narrowly focused models that typically serve a single purpose.  While useful, the current process is too slow, doesn't readily adapt to changes, and does not encompass the entire battlespace.  The future operational need is for a capability that enables rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance.  Significant effort has been undertaken to develop individual PMESII models.  This BAA focuses on technologies for rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance; rather than individual PMESII model development.  The scope of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate technologies to: 1) Facilitate PMESII model development, adaptation, and maintenance, 2) Integrate and/or make interoperable heterogeneous PMESII models, and 3) Leverage proven software engineering concepts such as standards, APIs, interfaces, etc.

Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for developing innovative and critical technologies necessary to make the CPE capability viable. The vision of this research is a "PMESII Model Framework and Development Environment" that is analogous to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for software development. Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches, as well as applied research capabilities, will be sought. The goal of this effort will be to develop technologies that support an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for PMESII model development and maintenance.  Such technologies  include editors/browsers/inspectors, debuggers, version control, hierarchy diagrams, visual development, common model APIs and interfaces, interoperable data and model schema (ontologies), knowledge elicitation, model producer and consumer GUIs, and model reuse. The IDE should be capable of handling heterogeneous modeling frameworks while preserving their underlying formalisms.  For example Markov Decision Process might be connected to an Adaptive Neural Net.  The logic associated with each should be preserved. Also to be addressed  are model scalability, dynamically multi-resolution models and resolution requirements, model abstraction techniques, model validation and verification, mapping of PMESII attributes to Diplomatic Infrastructure Military and Economic (DIME) actions and the predictive capability of the models, dynamic update of schema data/trends and learning/updating relationships amongst attributes.  Solutions are also sought for interoperability between "soft social" and "hard infrastructure" models. All modeling techniques and technologies are of interest (e.g. System dynamics, Fuzzy Network, Associative Memories, Topic Trees, etc.). This BAA places a particular interest in new and innovative approaches for PMESII element modeling and interactions.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $2M; FY 07 - $2.4M; and FY 08 - $500K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts ranging between $50,000 and $300,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 1) Effectiveness in enhancing rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance of PMESII models for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness.  Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4.  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando, TSD intends to contract on a sole-source basis with Northrop Grumman, in support of Technical expertise in conducting an architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS). A sole source award is contemplated because Northrop Grumman Information Technology’s COTS CTTASã is the underlying architect of the GRTS system and as such would be the only contractor that could provide the technical support needed to conduct the study of architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS) to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications. 

The Navy is developing a new class of combatant called Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  This concept provides a Sea Frame and Multiple Mission Packages.  Mission Packages and Sea Frames will be deployed forward and crews will rotate based on time-on-station and mission.  Both the Sea Frames and the Mission Packages are being developed using a spiral development approach.  LCS Core and Mission Package Training is both a near and long tear challenge.  Current industry teams are developing the Sea Frames while Navy Laboratories and other industries develop the Baseline Zero Mission Package for Mined Warfare (MIW) and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW).  As stated above the concept is for crews to rotate every 90 days.  Developing and maintaining tactical proficiency for multiple crews staged in Fleet concentration areas presents a significant challenge.

The Navy needs a Total Ship Training capability that can be used to develop and maintain crew proficiency for LCS combat operations.  This training system needs to be ready to begin use no later than December 2006.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends for the contractor to conduct an architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS) Architecture to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications.  The purpose of this task is to have the contractor provide technical support to the Government in the development of a “30 day quick study” analysis of possible shore-based training system solutions for the LCS core and mission system training. Architecture is to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications. The immediate requirement is to have a contractor provide technical support to the Government in the development of a “30 day quick study” analysis of possible shore-based training system solutions for the LCS core and mission system training. 

The CTTASã is a commercial COTS product that provides simulation framework for developing both training systems and warfare/system analysis test beds.  CTTASã is an open architecture set of software components that runs on standard PC hardware linked on standard networks.  The CTTASã framework features standard application programming interfaces (API) for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) as well as well-defined APIs for display and system interfaces.  As the architect for this simulation framework, which comprises the GRTS architecture, it is imperative that Northrop Grumman Information Technology provides the technical support necessary to complete this “30 day quick study” analysis.

This sole source award is based on substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to recover through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the customer’s needs. Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact not later than Closing time of this notice. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 

If you have any questions or concerns please contact: Mr. Mark A. Muñiz, Contract Specialist, phone 407-380-4080, fax 407-380-4164, or Mark.Muniz@Navy.Mil

Sources that wish to express capabilities that contradict the above justification should submit such capabilities to the identified contact specialist no later than the closing date of this notice.  Statement of Work is posted at the NAVAIR Orlando TSD Business Opportunities Website:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>DHHS-ORDC-DDA-05-12

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The National Response Plan designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical responses to man-made or natural disasters.  The HHS Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was established in 2002.  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect the American population from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.  Specifically, the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) within OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in preparation for a public health emergency response.  
DESCRIPTION:   The purpose of this notice is to indicate that HHS anticipates publishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition of product on or after December 5, 2005.  The Department of Health and Human Services has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of therapeutic products to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic disruptions associated with Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  ARS, also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by radiation delivered to the whole body (or a large proportion of the body) over a period of seconds to days. In addition ingested, inhaled, or absorbed radioisotopes could also produce ARS. There are several blood-cell types that are primarily affected in ARS including white cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes), red cells, and platelets.  The significant decrease of neutrophils (called neutropenia) significantly increases an individual's susceptibility to lethal infections.  Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia, (a lack of platelets and red blood cells respectively) can significantly increase an individual's risk for bleeding (at platelet levels <20,000/uL) or tissue ischemia due to loss of oxygen carrying capacity, respectively.  The current requirement is for the acquisition of up to 100,000 treatment courses of medical countermeasures to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic syndrome associated with ARS; THE TREATMENTS TO BE ACQUIRED MUST MITIGATE AND/OR TREAT NEUTROPENIA. Following whole body radiation exposure in the 2 to 6 Gy range, treatment of neutropenia is the most critical clinical requirement and thus Offerors' product(s) must mitigate and/or treat neutropenia associated with ARS. Medical countermeasures that both treat and/or mitigate the other components of the hematopoetic syndrome and/or the gastrointestinal syndrome of ARS are of interest to the USG. The gastrointestinal syndrome facilitates the transmigration of the intestinal flora placing patients with neutropenia at increased risk of life-threatening bacteremia and sepsis.  The Technical Evaluation Criteria to be published in the RFP will establish a scoring system whereby those products that can address additional components of ARS in addition to neutropenia (including thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, GI syndrome, etc.) will be given additional points.  This acquisition is based on the availability of funds.
  
The RFP to be issued will be on the basis of full and open competition.  Subcontracting with small and small disadvantaged business is encouraged.  All Offerors with a candidate product or products for the mitigation and/or treatment of neutropenia alone or neutropenia in combination with one or more additional components of ARS that meet the Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility specified in the RFP are encouraged to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  
The Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility will include:
Product(s) that treat the neutropenia associated with ARS.  Neutropenia will be defined as a reduction in neutrophils (granulocytes) meeting one of the following criteria:
o	Moderate <1000 neutrophils/uL
o	Severe <500 neutrophils/uL
The Government reserves the right to make single or multiple contract awards.  It is anticipated that up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses may be acquired under SEPARATE RFP(s) at a later date, contingent on the availability of funds.  
The RFP will be released on GSA FEDBIZOPPS website (www.fbo.gov).  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing airborne weather surveillance support services for the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) in support of defense and commercial launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida. Services include, but are not limited to, (1) airborne real time observation and reporting of weather phenomena and parameters to help the Launch Weather Team (LWT) determine the likelihood of natural and/or triggered lightning in support of launch operations; and (2) direct aerial observation and interpretation of real time weather conditions in and around the Eastern Range (ER) to help the LWT evaluate meteorological phenomena associated with established Launch Commit Criteria (LCC).  Offerors must possess and demonstrate a broad knowledge of basic meteorological observational skills and of the established Launch Commit Criteria (LCC).  Offerors must possess specific skills that include determining cloud bases and tops, cloud opaqueness, and in cloud precipitation. Operating locations will include CCAFS, Patrick AFB, FL, and further locations to be determined.  Offerors must possess access to aircraft capable of operating under all weather conditions during day or night to an altitude of 40,000 feet (service ceiling) with a minimum rate of climb of 3,300 feet per minute, attain speeds of 400 knots or more, measure/monitor outside air temperature and winds, and occasionally fly through moderate icing and turbulence.  The offeror shall have a FAA Part 135 certificate for their aircraft and meet requirements as outlined in 14 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 135.163, with a FAA Standard Airworthiness Certificate.  The offeror must be able to support operations at any hour, any day of the year with 10 days notice.  The pilot shall follow procedures IAW 45 SWI 13-201 established by the 45 SW for operating an aircraft in restricted airspace.  For all launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), the offeror shall place an aircraft on standby at Patrick AFB, FL so that government representatives have access at a minimum of three hours prior to the beginning of the launch window.  The aircraft must be airborne within 15 minutes of call-up by the government. Once airborne, the aircraft must have the ability to perform surveillance for up to three continuous hours.  The offeror will provide continuous radio communication with the Launch Weather Operations Center (LWOC) while in flight.  Due to weather and/or other factors, the offeror must be able to support multiple launch attempts typically separated by a minimum of 24 hours.  Secret security clearances are required. The applicable NAICS code and size standard are 541990/1000 employees. Conflict of interest (COI) rules may apply, which would prohibit participation in related acquisitions and/or submit mitigation plans following release of the RFP.  Additional acquisition information will be available via Internet at https://45cons.patrick.af.mil/awsmr/.  Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the website for program documents; e.g., Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Acquisition Schedule, and Requests for Information (RFIs). Firms responding to this sources sought notice must (1) state whether they are a small or large business based on the size standard above; if applicable, identify subcontractors to be used and their anticipated responsibilities; (2) indicate if a small disadvantaged or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (3) provide experience in the form of an outline of previous projects for specific relevant work completed or currently being performed of equivalent magnitude including contract numbers, description of the work, points of contact, and phone numbers; professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel identified to perform the work; and (4) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess a firm’s capabilities. Because the government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside based on the responses received, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information so that capabilities can be evaluated accurately. Complete responses must be received by the government prior to close of business on 2 Dec 2005. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.

<CONTACT>Purnell Drew, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-5132, Fax 202-2059028, Email purnell.drew@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), is pleased to issue this solicitation for the FirstSource program.  This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. This final solicitation replaces the draft issued on August 9, 2005.
ITAC’s primary goal of the FirstSource acquisition is to establish a portfolio of IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department.  The FirstSource Program will support the DHS goal of promoting a functionally integrated Department with standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among the Department’s Components. DHS needs access to technological advances and new business practices as they occur that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHS’s Department-wide buying power to obtain lowest possible prices. 
The FirstSource Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractor’s commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. 
The method for accomplishing these objectives is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology, on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking, and associated services. The high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.

<DESC>NOTE: The text that follows is intended to replace the entire notice published November 16, 2005.

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.  
	
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT:  The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP.  

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. The IC contract will include reimbursement for the required medical evacuation coverage, not to exceed $500.00, and medical examination costs up to $500.00. 3) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. 
	
NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are NOT authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a “secret” security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Interested individuals are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps at:

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS-BT/USCS/PDDC20229/Reference%2DNumber%2DIC%2D2006%2D01/Attachments.html . 

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at  http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf . A copy of the 2002 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBP.IC@dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied previously are to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and awarded a contract for one or more assignments in the future. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00).

CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at  http://www.acqnet.gov/far/ ). The contract document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. 

NOTE: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of a contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number.

Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept the contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor.  

NOTE: This announcement is not an offer of employment. This Notice is being published on an annual basis and supersedes previous notices for intermittent contractors issued by CBP. This Notice remains in affect until canceled or superseded. Applicants must realize that CBP requirements for the services described above occur on a sporadic basis and there is no assurance or guarantee that they will receive a contract for the services described herein. 

DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE IN FEDBIZOPPS: One or more documents available at the FedBizOpps website may be in a compressed ZIP format. Applicants using MS WINDOWS XP should be able to unzip the files without difficulty. Applicants using previous or other operating systems will need to obtain suitable decompression/unzip software (i.e., WINZIP, PKZIP, etc.) to view the files.

<DESC>****NOTE: CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO PREVIOUS WORDING OF THE NOTICE TO CLARIFY THE FACT THAT DLA INTENDS TO PURCHASE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND MAINTENANCE (NOT JUST MAINTENANCE) VIA THE PROSPECTIVE BPA.  SEE CHANGES REFLECTED THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS****
The DLA HQ Information Operations Directorate (J-6) has tasked the DLA Enterprise Support Acquisition Office (DES-A) to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) establishing terms by which the DLA Enterprise can obtain Cisco hardware, software, and maintenance.  

The goal is to provide the DLA Enterprise with best value, world class Cisco products and maintenance.  In assessing best value, DLA will consider a number of factors, which may include, but may not be limited to the following: 1) Price; 2) Delivery/Response Time; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Technical Capability, which can be broken down into the following subfactors: a) Asset Management, b) Organizational Structure, c) Value Added.  Two critical elements of asset management that should be noted are: 1) Order tracking (the effective maintenance of records including but not necessarily limited to sales data, DLA requiring activity/location, P/N, serial #, maintenance term, warranty, etc.); 2) Contractorâ€™s plan to meet DLA goal of consolidating/organizing DLA maintenance agreements to co-terminate at one end date.    

The Government anticipates the scope of the requirement to include all Cisco hardware, software, and maintenance P/N items currently in offering, including CONUS and OCONUS maintenance/support for the various DLA field activities around the world.    

The Government invites all interested, responsible parties to provide a brief plan/outline as to how they would best meet the Governmentâ€™s requirement.  The format for submission is at the discretion of the contractor, but should address the prospective evaluation factors noted.  The following information should also be provided by the interested party: 1) CAGE Code; 2) Business Size (Use NAICS code 423430, size standard: 500 employees as a reference point); 3) Cisco Certifications (i.e. Gold, Silver, Premier, etc.).  Keep in mind that this is not a formal solicitation, but a Request For Information (RFI) / Presolicitation Notice and responses to this notice should not be submitted, nor will they be evaluated as offers.  The Government will take into account feedback to this preliminary notice in the drafting its formal solicitation to be released at a later date.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. *** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. The Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire or a significant portion of the body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a relatively short time period (minutes).  This exposure results in the depletion of hematopoetic stem cells and progenitors, resulting in severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Severe neutropenia can significantly increase an individual’s susceptibility to lethal infections, while thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhage.  Currently there are no approved therapeutics to mitigate ARS.   The Government has an interest in identifying sources of therapeutics likely to be effective in preventing or reducing the development of neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia when administered at times after acute exposure to radiation.  The Government is particularly interested in identifying therapeutics that are effective when given several hours to days after exposure.    Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use; e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Information must be submitted by December 20, 2004. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person: Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, D. Andre Early. 

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<DESC>The INL has developed a small reliable, multiple-use, self-contained timed firing device capable of initiating multiple size shock-tubes, and conventional blasting caps, which facilitates the disruption of improvised explosive devices (IED).  This design is cost effective, can be placed into operation in less than one minute, several safeguards to prevent premature initiation, weather resistant, and weighs 6.2 ounces.  

The TTFD design is rectangular (2.5” x 5” x 1.2”) self-contained electronic timing device that is capable of initiating a standard shock tube or 2 ohm blasting cap when the count reaches zero.   The connector for electric blasting is an insulation displacement type connector supporting either a 20ga wire, solid or stranded, or a stranded 18ga wire.

DESC:  The National Institutes of Health is doing a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of:

•	Hubzone 
•	Service-disabled veteran owned 
•	8(a) and
•	small businesses. 

The NIH would like to also determine of the below required services are commercially available. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a large biomedical research facility with approximately 2500 radioactive materials laboratories and a 350-bed research hospital. The NIH is licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to use a wide variety and appreciable quantities of radioactive materials in biomedical research and medical diagnosis and treatment.  The NIH is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of businesses interested in helping NIH ensure compliance with regulations and policies governing the use of radioactive materials and radiation-producing equipment for biomedical research.   

The majority of the radioactive material laboratories and equipment are located in Bethesda, MD; however, some are located at other licensed locations in Gaithersburg, MD, Rockville, MD, Kensington, MD, Poolesville, MD, Frederick, MD, and Baltimore, MD.  In addition to routine radioactive materials laboratories, NIH has a number of special-use laboratories in the Nuclear Medicine and PET Departments, in the Building 21 hot lab facility, and in the cyclotron facility.  

The purpose of this procurement is to contract for qualified technical assistance to be provided to assist NIH in ensuring compliance with pertinent regulations and policies.
The scope of the work is in the following areas:
&#61507;	About 5000 comprehensive (24 radiation safety compliance items to be evaluated) surveys per year

&#61507;	Monthly surveys of about 250 labs

&#61507;	Bi-monthly checks on security of radioactive materials based on a computer-generated list that specifies areas to be checked weekdays, some to be checked weekday evenings (between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.), and some to be checked on weekends.

&#61507;	Inspection of radiation-producing equipment (about 15 radiographic units, 15 fluoroscopic units, 5 bone densitometers, 15 dental radiographic units, 20 cabinet x-ray units, 6 x-ray diffraction units; 25 electron microscopes, 6 CT scanners) 
&#61507;	MARSSIM type final status surveys: the time frame for completing final status surveys (approximately 2 times per year) will vary depending on the size and condition of the site and the evacuation and demolition schedules. The Contractor shall negotiate the time frame with and directly bill the NIH representative coordinating the decommissioning of that particular facility.

<DESC>This FEDBIZOPPS Announcement modifies notice "Reference-Number-FSACOD-05", posted February 22, 2005, that stated Federal Student Aid (FSA) intended to award to Accenture a one (1) year sole source contract with a one (1) year option at the discretion of the government.

The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) of the Department of Education intends to award a seven (7) month sole source contract with three (3) one (1) year options, at the discretion of the government, to Accenture.     Accenture's Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system supports the origination and disbursements of funds for FSA's Pell Grant and Direct Loans programs to post-secondary schools and students.  The intended contract will be for COD System operations, maintenance, call center, technical, documentation support, and update the system to support new Award Years.  FSA believes that Accenture is the only source possessing the necessary existing information, resources, and expertise to meet the FSA's Pell Grant and Direct Loan program requirements within the time required by FSA.  As a result of a competitive procurement, FSA awarded a contract for the integration of COD into a new financial aid delivery system referred to as Advance.  The contract that FSA intends to award to Accenture is necessary to continue services for COD until the new Advance system is in production.

MDA intends to utilize its Basic Support Services Program (BSSP) General Services Administration (GSA) ordering procedures to acquire the services described in this notice (information on the MDA BSSP may be found at http://www.mda.mil/barbb/setaserv.htm).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) category for this requirement is 561210 FACILITIES SUPPORT SERVICES (BASE MAINTENANCE), with a size standard of $30 million.  This requirement is open to all GSA schedule holders; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit only small businesses if a sufficient number are determined to possess the required capabilities.  MDA is seeking business firms under GSA schedule contract sources to support staff augmentation for approximately 35 on-site staff in support of Security Operations and Access Control at its Huntsville, Alabama facilities.  Based on capability statements submitted in response to this notice, the Government will invite the only the “most highly qualified” companies to participate in the competition. GSA schedule holders judged best qualified to compete for the work will be sent a draft Request for Quotations package within two (2) weeks of the deadline for submission of capability statements and invited to schedule “1-on-1” meetings with Government representatives to address any questions.  A final RFQ will be released on or about January 2nd, 2006, with offers due approximately two (2) weeks later.  

The required support includes:  Facility security services at the 106 Wynn Drive and 215 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL locations, including Federal Holidays and weekends.  Work includes: controlling visitor access; monitoring personnel access; controlling electro-magnetic media entry and exit; recording visit authorization requests through refinement, maintenance and operation of computerized badging, access and Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) systems; escorting visitors, facility maintenance, and limited numbers of construction personnel; operating and maintaining a computerized badging station connected to MDA badging systems; issuing local security badges, to include ability to manipulate digital photographs in multiple formats; operating and maintaining database, and trouble shooting MDA networked access control system; performing light maintenance and troubleshooting of door and access control system hardware.  

The security services required include:  (a) Operating a Security Operations Center (SOC) to include:  Duty Communications Controller and security communications that provide sufficient coverage to encompass all MDA facilities within the Huntsville, AL vicinity; security clearance administration; foreign visit administration; facility physical security and anti-terrorism/force protection; employee and tenant badging; emergency assessment; security training and briefings; liaison with other agencies and functional elements such as Emergency Action Center (EAC) and the SI Counterintelligence Division (SIC); EAC back-up and Continuity of Operations (COOP) implementation; office/equipment operations; issuing and maintaining courier cards; establishing an alternate SOC as required; (b) performing access control functions including:  processing visit requests; processing and escorting visitors; controlling electronic media and classified materials; maintaining records; and (c) other security functions including:  supporting actions; formulation and preparation of security plans and policies; security surveillance and special requirements; contract management; providing and managing technical anti-terrorism/force protection procedures; and security of MDA spaces and information systems.

A draft Statement of Objectives may be found at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website, https://www.fedteds.gov, using the solicitation number “HQ0006-06-Q-0002”.  Businesses must register with the FedTeDS site in order to access this information.  Once the short-list is determined and the formal RFQ released, only firms on the short-list will have access to the FedTeDS HQ0006-06-Q-0002 site.

The resultant order will consist of a Firm-Fixed Price support services contract line item for steady-state support and a Time & Materials contract line item for in-scope short-term performance requirements above the level of effort authorized under the contract at its steady state (i.e. to support conferences, large meetings, etc.).  

The term of the order including options is anticipated to be at least four (4) years.  All positions will be on site at the following MDA locations: 106 Wynn Drive and 215 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL.  MDA may expand operations to other facilities in the Huntsville area or aboard Redstone Army Arsenal.  These services may be expanded to those other locations.

Acceptable sources must hold a GSA Schedule, and be able to provide 100% of personnel with SECRET clearances on task order start date which will be 30 calendar days after task order award date.  

GSA schedule contractors who qualify under NAICS 561210 Facilities Support Services (Base Maintenance) are invited to submit to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than November 29, 2005, a three-page Capability Statement summarizing the corporate strengths in relation to the following criteria:

<DESC>The U.S.Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate Ft.Eustis Virginia is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This notice neither constitutes an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor do es it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. The current aging fleet of the U.S.Armys aircraft towing vehicles contains many vehicles that do not have logistical support. In addition newer vehicles locally procured to meet immediate n eeds, also do not have logistical support. As a result this survey is being conducted to gain knowledge of sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy the U.S Armys requirements through the use of commercial or Non-Developmental Items (NDI) systems, fo r a Standard Aircraft Towing System (SATS). The SATS must be able to move aircraft and AGSE by towing/pushing to support various maintenance operations on level and inclined surfaces up to 15 degrees, utilizing diesel fuel or JP-8 without degradation in pe rformance. Weights of aircraft run from about 1229 pounds for an A/MH-6 to about 55,000 pounds for the maximum gross weight of an MH-47.  The SATS should improve unit readiness by providing aviation units with a standardized, logistically supported towing system, capable of towing or relocating aircraft and AGSE on improved/unimproved surfaces and in and around aircraft hangers.  The SATS will be employed in aviation maintenance units worldwide and is expected to operate under the same climatic conditions a s the aircraft it supports, during daytime or nighttime in adverse weather conditions in a temperature range from 25 degrees F to +145 degrees F. The SATS must be capable of safely seating and carrying two personnel, with toolboxes, and securely carrying a standard aircraft tow bar. The rear service deck for carrying tools and parts should be no higher than (48) inches. The SATS must possess a low profile to enable clearance under and around helicopter rotor blades and allow for deployment by internal or e xternal transport assets, i.e.C-130 and CH-47 aircraft    (maximum height, with operator (75) inches, maximum width (57) inches, and maximum length (115) inches), or be transported by ground units as cargo on or behind organic vehicles. In order to maintai n cost effectiveness the mean time between mission failures should be 160 hours. Interested Vendors are invited to submit a (3) page White Paper providing a description of their system .The White Paper shall include, as a minimum: 1) A description of the s ystem and the validating information supporting claims that the proposed system meets the above performance capabilities; 2) Product literature; 3) Past performance information; and 4) Price schedules/catalogues (not included in the page count). Respondent s must also include information regarding 1) customary practices  (include warranties, discounts, etc.), and under which commercial sales of the product are made, and 2) requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the items discussed. Additionally, respondents should express their interest in performing a collaborative effort, e.g., a cooperative research and development agreement or vendor demonstration (without Government funding). Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sough t shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as such. Responses to this Sources Sought should be received no later than 9 JAN 2006. This announcement is for purposes of exchanging information to improve understanding of the G overnment requirement and industry capability and is for information and planning.  This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. Vendors with systems that can meet the requirements will be asked approximately mid-March, about arrangements for t heir system to be demonstrated at a Government facility.  Address responses to Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN:  AMSRD-AMR-AA-P (Dominick Lubrano), Bldg 401, Lee Blvd, Ft Eustis, VA 23604-5577.

<SUBJECT>R -- Tissue-Based Small Animal Model for HIV Drug Discovery
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the J. Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (Gladstone) for a multiple-year contract to establish a small-animal model to evaluate potential therapeutics for HIV-1 infection.  This work is currently being performed by Gladstone under contract number N01-AI-05418, entitled “Tissue-Based Small Animal Model for HIV Drug Discovery”.  The animal model being used is an immunodeficient mouse engrafted with human fetal thymus and liver (SCID-hu Thy/Liv) and infected with well-characterized isolates of HIV-1.  Gladstone possesses a unique capability to evaluate potential HIV-1 therapeutics, alone and in combination, for efficacy and toxicity in vivo, in a validated animal model consisting of SCID mice engrafted with human fetal thymus and liver (SCID-hu Thy/Liv) tissue and infected with a diverse panel of well characterized primary isolates and molecular clones of HIV-1.  Gladstone has a license from Stanford University, the holder of the patent rights for the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model, to use the model to evaluate therapeutic entities that may originate in the private sector.  The statutory authority justifying this other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)1) and FAR 6.302-1.  See Numbered Note 22.

A. Introduction
The Health Communications Specialist (HCS) assigned to USAID/Zambia shall collaborate with the U.S. Embassy, AID/W, Department of State Office for Global AIDS Coordination (OGAC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Peace Corps, and the Defense Attaché Office -- collectively referred to as the U.S. Mission (USG) -- to create awareness of the American assistance being provided to Zambia through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  


B. Program Overview and Maintenance of Multiple Office Relationships
With interest in HIV/AIDS growing, the HCS position is critical to the functioning of the U.S. Mission in making sure that clear, consistent information on the United States Government’s HIV/AIDS programs is available to Zambian policymakers and the public.

The HCS works out of the Program, Resources, and Monitoring Office (PRM) primarily to provide public communications backstop support to Strategic Objective Team 9 (Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS) and to other USG staff managing PEPFAR-funded activities.  

Although there are no direct supervisory duties associated with the HCS position, the incumbent shall work collaboratively with USAID SO teams, relevant U.S. agency representatives, and the U.S. Mission Emergency Coordinator to strengthen internal PEPFAR links within the U.S. Mission as well as improve contacts and promote better public relations with local press.  

The HCS shall collaborate with the U.S. Embassy’s Public Affairs Section (PAS), which has overall media and public relations responsibility for the USG.  The HCS shall assist the PAS in developing appropriate public relations for the entire U.S. Mission relating to the Mission’s HIV/AIDS activities.

The HCS shall develop a collegial professional relationship with and serve as a mentor to the FSN Development Outreach and Communications Officer (DOC) who will principally support all non-PEPFAR funded activities.  Mentoring of the DOC shall include substantial help with developing the American English skills of the DOC, including editing assistance, as required.

ISSUANCE DATE: November 15, 2005
CLOSING DATE/TIME: December 19, 2005, 15:00 Local time, Washington, D.C.
POSITION TITLE:  Legal Reform Advisor
MARKET VALUE:  $103,947 - $135,136
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two Years
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.
SECURITY ACCESS:  Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens Only

I. Background

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E), Office of Economic Growth, is seeking to hire under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) a qualified individual to fill the position of Legal Reform Advisor.  Under the direction of the Division Chief of Market Transition and/or his/her designee with the Office of Economic Growth, the Advisor will provide substantive analytical and technical expertise in the area of legal reform that promotes market based economies creating sustainable job growth.  The work will support the Bureaus’ objective of promoting a sound, competitive and market responsive private economic sector which is key to the transition from a centrally planned to market economy.

Below are some of the priority economic and legal reform areas on which the E&E/EG Office works:

(1) Enterprise formation (company--laws, business registries);
(2) Business transactions (contract law, collateral/secured transactions law and registries);
(3) Tax regimes (income, payroll taxes as they affect business decisions);
(4) Business finance (access to debt and equity capital via effective banking and capital markets systems);
(5) Accounting standards and practices consistent with international norms and conducive to foreign investment;
(6) Open competition (de-regulation policy, anti-monopoly laws, government procurement rules, etc.);
(7) Land issues (privatization, titling, real estate markets)
(8) Trade regimes (laws/policies on subsidies, customs, tariffs, intellectual property, etc.);
(9) Effective means for business exit '(bankruptcy and insolvency laws and procedures); 
(10) Labor market laws and policies (labor market flexibility, ease of hiring and firing); and
(11) Anti-corruption measures (financial disclosure, ethics codes, and watchdog groups) to help insure transparency and credibility in the functioning of laws and policies.

The E&E Bureau and Missions in the region rely on the technical staff in Washington to help develop economic growth strategies for individual countries, and perform assessments, design new technical assistance activities, and evaluate current programs. Washington technical staff are expected to play an important role in bringing practical USAID (and other donor/IFI) knowledge not only regarding the economic reform models which have worked (or not worked) in the region but also the experience of the last ten years in implementing comprehensive and interactive economic reform programs and individual activities. This ensures that new economic growth programs incorporate the lessons learned, both positive and negative, and use the most effective technical assistance models to accelerate the transfer of skills and expertise.

Duties and Responsibilities

Under the technical direction of the Chief, Market Transition Division, in the E&E/EG office, or his or her designee, and in close coordination with the USAID Missions in E&E, the Legal Reform Advisor will be responsible for (1) identifying and assessing the problems and obstacles experienced by private sector participants and relevant government bodies with a focus on commercial and economic laws/policies, business regulation and institutional development: (2) designing, developing, and evaluating specific interventions to address the constraints and barriers to private sector development in the region, taking into account the current needs of the private sector and governments, other donor activities, and past program designs and interventions; and (3) representing USAID in economic and legal reform discussions  with senior level host government, other multilateral and U.S. Government agencies and ensuring effective interaction and coordination with those entities.

More specifically, the Legal Reform Advisor's duties will include, but not be limited to, the following:

1.  Provide leadership in developing and refining strategies for commercial and economic law, business regulatory and institutional development throughout E&E.

2.  Maintain and disseminate information for use by USAID and other interested entities on the status and progress of legal/regulatory/institutional aspects of private sector development in E&E countries. Provide for means of regular updating the information, refinement of program indicators and measures, and effective summary presentations of most relevant information and findings to USAID Missions and senior USAID managers.

3. Design and develop cost-effective activities (involving contracts, grants, interagency agreements with USG-agencies, transfer of funds to public international organizations, etc.) for both regional and country-specific commercial and economic law, business regulatory and institutional development initiatives. This includes, but is not limited to, conducting or participating on country- and/or sector-level assessments, designing projects, identifying funding and implementation mechanisms, developing terms of reference for assistance programs, conducting needed competitions, reviewing bids, and overseeing implementation once the activities are underway. In addition, this includes the pursuit of innovative means to engage the services of lawyers, business economists, judges, and other professionals on a pro bono basis which might reduce total activity costs while enhancing effectiveness. 

4. Establish and maintain high-level professional contacts with counterpart senior officials and representatives of the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD, the EBRD, the EU, other USG agencies and private sector entities (foundations, NGOs, etc.) involved in commercial and economic law, business regulatory and institutional development in the E&E region. 

5. Keep abreast of professional literature in order to (a) promote coordination of bilateral and multilateral assistance and (b) identify alternative project implementation mechanisms and lessons learned to refine the design and delivery of USAID assistance.

6.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation with additional information included in this notice.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has a need for several Special Hearing Officers to provide hearings for applicants and licensees if they request one upon receipt of a notice of firearms license denial or revocation.   (Reference 18 U.S.C. § 923(f)(2) and 27 CFR, part 478, subpart E.  The hearings will be conducted at numerous locations throughout the country.  Special Hearing Officers, hereinafter referred to as “contractor(s),” must possess sufficient abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by the Firearms and Explosives Industry Services Division (FEISD).  Each contractor, when conducting a hearing, is representing the ATF.  The ATF expects such representation to reflect positively on the Bureau.  To that end, contractors, when conducting hearings, must present themselves in a professional manner.  Upon completion of a hearing assignment each contractor must submit the following items to the FEISD: 1) Hard copy of the Hearing Officer Report; 2) Disk containing the Hearing Officer Report -Audio tape(s) of the hearing; 3) Completed Contractor’s Invoice for Payment; and 4) Attachments/exhibits as stated in the Hearing Officer Report.  The Hearing Officer must hand deliver these items to FEISD or ship using Federal Express account number provided by FEISD within ten business days of the completion of the hearing.  If a contractor determines that he or she cannot meet the due date for a particular report, the contractor must seek an extension from FEISD.  The hearing shall be recorded using an audio tape recorder, which will be provided by FESID and operated by the hearing officer.  The tape, along with the exhibits, shall constitute the official record of the hearing.   Contractors will be required to conduct the hearing and review the tape recording (post-hearing), take accurate notes of the hearing, and reduce those notes to writing in the form of a Hearing Officer Report.  Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all of their reports are neatly prepared, grammatically correct, free of spelling errors, and most importantly, factually accurate.  Hearing Officer Reports must be able to stand up to de novo judicial review in U.S. District Court if necessary.  ATF will terminate the contract of contractors who repeatedly present report inaccuracies or discrepancies.  Hearing Officer Reports must objectively state the facts as presented during the hearing.   In order to receive assignments and to complete the required Hearing Officer Reports, each contractor must possess, or have access to and knowledge of the following equipment and software programs: 1) A personal computer with a Windows™ operating system, preferably Windows 98™ or newer; 2) An Inkjet or LaserJet printer.  (Dot-matrix printers are not acceptable equipment;) 3) A full version of Microsoft Word®.  (Microsoft Works® will not suffice as an acceptable software program); 4) Each personal computer must have Microsoft Excel® loaded thereon, or each contractor must be able to download from the World Wide Web a “reader” that will permit the user to read Microsoft Excel® documents; and 5) Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Microsoft Outlook®.  (Microsoft Outlook Express®, standing alone, will not be sufficient.)  Pre and post-hearing responsibilities, in many cases, requires the contractor to use his or her personal telephone, cellular telephone, FAX machine, or other related equipment.  ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase, maintenance, use or misuse of these devices. ATF will reimburse the contractor for reasonable and necessary FAX transmittals and long-distance telephone calls made in connection with the conduct of a hearing.  Local telephone calls or cellular airtime charges will not be reimbursed.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a hearing.  Audiotapes, notes, exhibits, copies of Hearing Officer Reports, etc. are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  The contractor will retain all notes and a copy of the Hearing Officer Report for 120 days after the official report and file is submitted.  The contractor is to destroy all notes and material at that time.  Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the Firearms and Explosives Industry Services Division.  Contractors are expected to use their own private facilities when preparing the Hearing Officer Report in connection with hearings.  ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase or maintenance of a contactor’s personal facility, nor will ATF reimburse any contractor for use of such facility.  Contractors must be able to conduct hearings within a 200-mile radius of their home.  Contractors are expected to possess an automobile with appropriate insurance coverage. ATF assumes no liability for contractor misconduct or negligence while driving their personal automobile in connection with their hearing assignments.  When using their personal automobile in connection with performing assignments, contractors will be reimbursed for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.  (The current rate is $.485 per mile.)  Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of miles driven, as well as any other incidental expenses, in connection with any particular assignment. Such invoice is subject to audit by the FEISD.   Each contractor shall undergo a personnel security investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and/or data.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, and be performed under such standards as the Personnel Security Branch may establish.  The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.  Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or data will not be authorized.  Contractors are responsible for notifying the Personnel Security Branch of any changes in personnel information.  Contractors will be compensated for conducting the hearing, travel to the hearing site, conduct of the hearing, travel back to their residence and the preparation of the Hearing Officer Report.  In addition, contractors will be reimbursed for reasonable and ordinary expenses incurred in the performance of their assignments, such as long distance telephone calls, tolls, parking fees, etc.  Travel arrangements are the responsibility of the contractor and under no circumstances, will advances be made for anticipated or scheduled travel.  Significant travel is defined as modes of transportation other than the contractor’s personally owned vehicle and/or the requirement for lodging accommodations.  FEISD must pre-approve all significant travel in order to compensate the contractor.  Contractors will be reimbursed for travel costs associated with an assigned hearing.  When applicable, ATF will reimburse subsistence expenses to the contractor up to the current Government travel rates.  Airfares must be the coach or business class rate whichever is less.  The contractor shall submit such expenses detailed on an invoice specifying the hearing where the expenses apply.  This invoice, together with any other approved expenses incurred during any 30-day period will be summarized on a monthly invoice.  The Government has the right to audit all claims for payment or reimbursement.  The expert shall sign a non-disclosure agreement.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number S-WHARC-06-Q-1007 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The quotation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06.

<DESC>Section 1
Description of Services

1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1 Description of Services.  This effort supports a complete turnkey reengineer and upgrade of the ACC/A3X conference room (a.k.a. COMACC VTC) audiovisual (AV) and video teleconference (VTC) systems located at 205 Dodd Blvd, Room 224, at Langley AFB, VA.  Contractor will provide services to support the conference room reconfiguration and system upgrade.  

1.2 Scope.  Redesign and replace conference room AV and VTC equipment.  This will be a best value acquisition rated in the following order, quality and state-of-the-art technical capability being rated higher than  delivery time or price.  Need relocation of equipment to improve control room functionality and use.  The term “customer” designates the conference room user or conference attendee.  The term “operator” designates the person who maintains the room and room equipment (two AV equipment operators and two VTC equipment operators).  

1.2.1 Period of Performance:  Contractor shall have all necessary equipment and supplies available to start work within 5 business days of notification of award.  Complete all work within 10 work days of notification of award.  Work hours are 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday excluding holidays.  All employees will be accompanied by a government representative for escort while in the building.  All employee’s must be able to speak, read and understand English.  The following requirements are required of all employee’s:   full name, social security number, valid driver’s license and current proof of insurance if driving on base, and theymust provide a home address for base pass processing.

1.3 Background and Objective.  

1.3.1  Most of the conference room AV and VTC equipment is good but the condition and age makes reliability a risk.   Wiring is unlabeled, unsecured, excess cabling is coiled on the floor and obsolete cables not removed.  Moving around the room and access to most equipment is difficult.   Customers have access to all equipment and can change setting that cause operation problems and failures.  No laptop port exists at the conference room table for customers easy input to the AV system.  Remote controls aren’t configured for efficiency and menu navigation isn’t obvious to user.  Equipment racks are in the way of operators—a legacy from earlier configuration no longer relevant.  Projector images don’t fill the screens due to projectors throw distance limits, brightness limits and crypto rack placement.  Crypto cabinet door blocks projection when open making troubleshooting or equipment access impossible during projector operation.  Crypto cabinet must be moved.  Audio between control room and conference room is poor at best making it difficult for operator to answer customer questions.  

1.3.2  Objective is a total upgrade of all audio, video, presentation, and video-teleconferencing (VTC) network capabilities in support of all facility activities.  Prepared a flexible, fully automated, and very reliable audiovisual and videoconferencing system design package using high-quality and high-resolution devices for the best possible audio and visual intelligibility. The design must reflects a Command Headquarters large conference room upgrade solution that will provide outstanding performance for all presentation and videoconferencing requirements for the next 5-7 years with daily use. Some of the key conference room features include:

1.3.2.1 New High Resolution Video Projection System with Short Throw Lens

1.3.2.2 New state of the art fixed and wireless touch screen control of all peripheral devices and subsystems providing operational simplicity and control of the entire audiovisual and videoconferencing system from the control room facilitator station or floor space during mobile operation.

1.3.2.3 New video routing, audio routing, and control system infrastructure capable of sending any peripheral source to any local display or far end destination in native resolution.

1.3.2.4 New classified and unclassified Polycom videoconferencing capability in ISDN while posturing for IP 

1.3.2.5 On Demand selection and presentation control of up to (3) GFE laptop and desktop computers from remote control system

1.3.2.6 New microphone capability for 2-way communications with between the conference room and the control room

1.3.2.7 Turnkey single vendor design, installation, and maintenance for the proposed solution.

1.3.2.8 Vendor 90 day on-site repair warranty and 1-Year manufacturer warranty

<DESC>I. SCOPE OF WORK

A. Introduction
The Health Communications Specialist (HCS) assigned to USAID/Zambia shall collaborate with the U.S. Embassy, AID/W, Department of State Office for Global AIDS Coordination (OGAC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Peace Corps, and the Defense Attaché Office -- collectively referred to as the U.S. Mission (USG) -- to create awareness of the American assistance being provided to Zambia through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  


B. Program Overview and Maintenance of Multiple Office Relationships
With interest in HIV/AIDS growing, the HCS position is critical to the functioning of the U.S. Mission in making sure that clear, consistent information on the United States Government’s HIV/AIDS programs is available to Zambian policymakers and the public.

The HCS works out of the Program, Resources, and Monitoring Office (PRM) primarily to provide public communications backstop support to Strategic Objective Team 9 (Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS) and to other USG staff managing PEPFAR-funded activities.  

Although there are no direct supervisory duties associated with the HCS position, the incumbent shall work collaboratively with USAID SO teams, relevant U.S. agency representatives, and the U.S. Mission Emergency Coordinator to strengthen internal PEPFAR links within the U.S. Mission as well as improve contacts and promote better public relations with local press.  

The HCS shall collaborate with the U.S. Embassy’s Public Affairs Section (PAS), which has overall media and public relations responsibility for the USG.  The HCS shall assist the PAS in developing appropriate public relations for the entire U.S. Mission relating to the Mission’s HIV/AIDS activities.

The HCS shall develop a collegial professional relationship with and serve as a mentor to the FSN Development Outreach and Communications Officer (DOC) who will principally support all non-PEPFAR funded activities.  Mentoring of the DOC shall include substantial help with developing the American English skills of the DOC, including editing assistance, as required.  The HCS shall collaborate with and mentor the USAID and PAS Web Masters/Information Technology coordinators concerning website content related to PEPFAR.

The HCS shall work closely with the USAID Mission Director, the Deputy Chief of Mission, the Public Affairs Officer, and with fellow communications specialists for all USG HIV/AIDS cooperating agencies.

Determinations under this requirement are subject to the Disputes Clause.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause could constitute grounds for termination for default.  (b) Information Protection. The term "sensitive information" means any information which warrants a degree of protection and administrative control as defined by the Bureau of Reclamation or that meets the criteria for exemption from public disclosure set forth under Sections 552 and 552a of Title 5, United States Code: the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. Sensitive information is generally categorized as For Official Use Only (FOUO) Sensitive information, but in some cases may include other unclassified. (The protection of Classified information is beyond the scope of this clause.  If any work on Classified information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.) The Contractor shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized persons, organizations, or subcontractors. Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed sensitive by the Bureau of Reclamation shall be protected as instructed by Reclamation in accordance with the magnitude of the loss or harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the data. All provisions of this clause also apply to all subcontractors. (c) Required protective and nondisclosure requirements: (1)  The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any sensitive, or otherwise protected information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, electronic), pertaining to any part of this contract or any Reclamation program or activity, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval. (2) Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release. The Contractor shall submit its request to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days before the proposed date for release.

Subcontractors shall submit requests for authorization to release through the prime Contractor to the Contracting Officer. (4) Any Government-furnished information/material does not become the property of the Contractor and may be withdrawn at any time. Upon expiration of the contract, all documents released and any material using data from such documents shall be returned to the Contracting Officer's Representative for final disposition. Only with prior authorization may the Contractor retain the material. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not disclose or release the materials provided to any activity or individuals of the Contractor's organization not directly engaged in providing services under the contract that has not undergone an applicable suitability investigation commensurate with the contract specifications.  All technical data provided to the Contractor by the government shall be protected from public or private disclosure in accordance with the markings printed on them. All other information relating to the items to be delivered or the services to be performed under this contract shall not be disclosed by any means without prior approval of the authorized representative of the Contracting Officer. Prohibited dissemination or disclosure includes, but is not limited to: permitting access to such information by foreign nationals or by immigrant aliens who may be employed by the Contractor, publication of technical or scientific papers, advertising, and disclosure to contractor staff not investigated and deemed acceptable at the appropriate contract/information sensitivity level, or any other proposed public release. The Contractor shall provide adequate physical protection to such information so as to preclude access by any individual or entity not authorized such access by the government. Contractor shall maintain, and furnish upon demand of the Contracting Officer, records of the names of individuals who have access to sensitive material in its custody. All questions regarding classification, access and control shall be referred to the CO or COR for coordination with the Project Manager and/or the appropriate Reclamation Security Officer.

Sensitive information supplied as Government-furnished materials, to a non-Federal user, or those who produce new original work, are to be returned upon completion of the authorized work; the Contractor agrees to handle protected information as follows: (2) During non-duty hours, sensitive information must be secured within a locked office or suite, or secured in a locked container. (3) When electronically transmitting sensitive information, do so through means that limit the potential for unauthorized disclosure.  Since information transmitted over unencrypted electronic links such as telephones or electronic (e-mail) may be intercepted by unintended recipients, the Contractor, as custodian of sensitive information, will evaluate whether specific information warrants a higher level of protection accorded by a secure fax, phone, or other encrypted means of communication.   Note:  When sending sensitive information via fax, the sender shall ensure that the intended recipient is physically present at the receiving end of the fax before initiating the transmission. (4) Sensitive information may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service or commercial messenger, provided it is packaged in a way that does not disclose its contents.  Sensitive information will NOT be posted on the Internet or Contractor intranet. (5) Newly-created sensitive information will be marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO) Sensitive" in letters larger than the rest of the general text at the center-top and center-bottom of each page and within the title block on drawings and/or maps. (6) Classified information requires special marking and handling procedures.  If the Contractor will have access to classified information, Reclamation will provide additional handling instructions and training to the Contractor as needed. (7) The Contractor shall NOT provide access to employees, or subcontract employees, until written access clearance is provided by the Contracting Officer. (8) The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts. (e) Physical Security - General Procedural Security Requirements:  (1) The Contractor's employees governed by this contract may need to access sensitive information and/or may need access to designated restricted areas.

The requests may be during non-business hours (i.e. weekends, after hours or holidays). The government anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base period of one-year from date of award and four one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government. During the term of the contract, which includes the base year and all option years exercised, the government shall order, as a minimum, services in an amount of at least $10,000.00 USD and the maximum cumulative amount of the Task Orders issued during a single year will not exceed $25,000.00. The maximum dollar value for the life of the contract will be $125,000.00 which includes the base year and all options. Historically, the NAS has chartered from as few as one helicopter per year, to as many as five helicopters per year. 

The contractor will be required to have expertise and experience with FAA regulations, vendor certification (14 CFR 121,125,127,133,135 or 137 as appropriate), operated and maintained under provisions of 14 CFR 91,121,125,127, 133,135 or 137 as appropriate. The contractor shall provide all direct labor, material, transportation, supervision, aircraft maintenance and administration pertaining to the aircraft. When the government has a charter requirement, the contractor will be required to obtain chartered aircraft of varying sizes of a Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger III and/or a Bell 206L-4 Long Ranger IV in order to accommodate the numbers of USG and foreign nationals needing to travel via chartered aircraft. The contractor must be capable of responding to requests for chartered aircraft services within 12 hours of a request. The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency conduct appearance and integrity and shall be responsible for taking such disciplinary action against the Contractor’s employees as may be necessary. Personnel assigned to this contract must be acceptable to the Government in terms of personal and professional conduct. Personnel working on the contract or provided by the contractor to provide services shall not disclose sensitive information, or violate security and safety regulations and procedures. If contractor personnel are not upholding standards of conduct or create conflicts of interest with the Government, the Contracting Officer (CO) will notify the contractor and the personnel shall be removed from working on the contract. Any such actions will be justified and documented by the Government.  Failure to pass the background investigation will preclude a contractor employee from working on the contract.
