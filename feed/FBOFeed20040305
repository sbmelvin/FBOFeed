<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CARFULLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.   The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541710 "Oceanographic research and development laboratories or services".  TITLE: Survey of Deepwater Currents in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Recent deepwater leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico extend beyond water depths of 1,600 m.  The presence of these leases implies a potential for exploration by the oil and gas industry, which currently includes exploratory wells in the Lloyd Ridge area.  The eastern Gulf is a location strongly influenced by the Loop Current, its frontal eddies, and where Loop Current rings form.  Our most recent current data in the eastern Gulf reaches only to 1,300 m near the DeSoto Canyon.  In order for MMS to fulfill its regulatory function proactively, more current data in this area is definitely desirable.  This proposed study will collect current and hydrographic measurements in the eastern Gulf in water depth over 1,500 m that will allow identification of processes present in the region and help design future oceanographic studies.  To address this information need the MMS is conducting this study. The objectives of this study are: (1) to conduct measurements of deepwater currents in the eastern Gulf of Mexico using moorings to increase our regional database of ocean currents; (2) to improve our understanding of the regional oceanography to help design future studies, assist calculation of horizontal and vertical trajectories of release oil and its dispersion; and (3) to provide an oceanographic framework to help with interpretation of regional biological processes determining the organisms diversity.  The performance period of this study shall be forty-eight (48) months; the fieldwork task shall last eighteen (18) months including six (6) for mobilization at the beginning of this contract.  The remaining 30 months shall be devoted to analyses, synthesis of results, and completion of all deliverables.  The study area is bounded at the northwest corner at 28.848°N, 87.918°W; the northeast corner at 28.850°N, 87.523°W; the southwest corner at 27.453°N, 87.907°W; and the southeast corner at 27.455°N, 87.516°W.  Cost of this study is estimated to be between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000.  This study consists of three (3) main tasks: (1) conducting a post award meeting; (2) field work and data collection (three moorings); (3) and data analyses and report preparation.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Immunization Services Division, National Immunization Program, seeks assistance to determine effectiveness of a telephone reminder to increase pneumococcal vaccination in a population that has already received mail reminders and to determine whether the impact of this intervention is similar for African Americans and Whites.  Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all persons age 65 and older, and for younger persons with chronic medical conditions such as heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease, or immunodeficiency.  Yet among persons age 65 and older, marked differences in pneumococcal vaccine coverage exist by race/ethnicity.  According to 2000-2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data, 57% of non-Hispanic Whites compared to 33% of non-Hispanic Blacks recalled receiving pneumococcal vaccine (MMWR vol. 52, no. 40).  Although the racial gap in younger persons is less remarkable, vaccination rates among high risk patients age 18 to 64 are low, with 10% coverage among high risk persons age 18 to 49 and 27% coverage among high risk persons age 50 to 64 (NHIS 2001 data, unpublished).  Managed care has been shown to decrease racial disparities in immunization coverage compared to fee-for-service insurance; however, racial disparities in coverage persist in managed care (Schneider et al 2001).  Little is known about why disparities exist in populations with equal access to care.  Evaluation of a randomized trial within a managed care setting will help to determine whether telephone outreach improves pneumococcal vaccine uptake among minority high risk populations as well as identifying potential barriers to vaccination.  The Scope of Work requires providing a telephone reminder to 400 to 500 persons, per category, in the following four categories: 1) unvaccinated African American patients age 18 to 64 with high risk conditions, 2) unvaccinated White patients age 18 to 64 with high risk conditions, 3) unvaccinated African American patients age 65 and over, and 4) unvaccinated White patients age 65 and over.  Uptake of immunization will then be compared to unvaccinated controls. The selected contractor must be able to identify high risk adults under 65, and be able to identify pneumococcal vaccination status for high risk adults 18 to 64 and adults 65 and over to exclude those already vaccinated from the randomization.   Deliverables include the following:  1)  Baseline eligible sampe and randomization strategy, 30 days ARO;  2)  Survey database fields and design, 30 days ARO;  3)  Nursing script and survey collection instruments, 60 days ARO; and De-identified dataset with documentation, 12 months ARO.   Offerors will be required to submit a proposal which describes their understanding of the problem and an approach for providing the services required by the Statement of Work.  The entire scope of work, deliverables and evaluation factors are addressed in the solicitation documents.  The period of performance is for 12 months.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less then $100,000 and is being issued unrestricted.   Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 2004-Q-01228 will be issued by mail and posted on FBO on or after March 19, 2004, and proposals will be due April 9, 2004.   No telephone requests will be accepted.    Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to: DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, ATTN: Brenda Goodwin, MS L-1019, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.

Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute  Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation Certificate Program The Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation is a training and research program dedicated to persons with severe mental illness and to the development and investigation of rehabilitation strategies that facilitate their treatment goals. Towards this end, Center faculty and staff train clinical staff as well as clinical leaders to implement user-friendly and effective rehabilitation programs, provide ongoing consultation for maintenance of those programs, and investigate the efficacy of various rehabilitation and staff training programs. In addition, Center faculty are leading experts on the stigma of mental illness and effective programs for erasing stigma. The Psychiatric Rehabilitation Certificate Program (PRCP) is the only program of its kind. Over the past five years, the Center has led national and international efforts in curricula development for paraprofessionals with the PRCP, and continues its tradition of excellence in materials and instructor training. The Center has an extensive program of over 30 colleges, more than 200 trained instructors, and a network of primary contacts that maintain a quality program throughout the state of Illinois. PRCP materials are currently being used in Argentina, South Korea, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, British Columbia, and Canada.  In the U.S., people from Florida, Colorado, and Louisiana have come to Illinois for instructor training. Texas is adopting the program in several large agencies and a state hospital, and as a result much of this large state will also be covered by PRCP. The PRCP is a 14-16 semester-hour certificate program designed for delivery in an academic setting, such as a community college or university.  Individual agencies or consortia may also use the courses as a staff development program, building the staff skills and improving service delivery through regularly planned practical training sessions. The PRCP curriculum includes 125 core competencies identified by several hundred mental health professionals, consumers, and representatives from the academic community as essential for staff working in the area of severe mental illness. Some of these competencies include: ·	psychiatric expertise  ·	knowledge of the mental health system  ·	understanding stigma  ·	advocacy  ·	cultural sensitivity  ·	treatment planning  ·	rehabilitation skills training ·	knowledge of medications  ·	crisis intervention  ·	legal issues ·	documentation  ·	first aid and safety  ·	benefits  There are three important things to note about the PRCP curriculum:  First, the curriculum assumes a rehabilitative approach to severe mental illness. This represents a significant change in how severe mental illness is viewed and treated.  Second, the courses feature state-of-the-art principles and techniques. The most up-to-date research has been used to develop the curriculum and training materials.  Third, PRCP courses are offered through community colleges across Illinois.  For these reasons, the University of Chicago Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation offers instructors' training for each course.  Satisfactory passing the instructors' training and the instructors' exam is necessary for approval to teach any of the courses in the PRCP curriculum. The Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation offers instructor training for each of its four PRCP courses.  Instructor training provides participants with practical information, tips, and how-to’s they can use to deliver high quality PSR training using the PRCP materials.  Instructor training sessions focus on the process of teaching PSR to staff or students. PRCP instructor training is an information and action filled experience. Using discussion, demonstration, participative exercises, and audio/visual aids, trainers will: ·	Provide lecture by lecture tips on how to teach the material ·	Point out key concepts and how they are presented  ·	Demonstrate exercises and role plays  ·	Identify pitfalls and common errors ·	Answer questions you might expect to hear  ·	Trouble-shoot areas common to many PSR staff and programs  ·	Model effective use of handouts and other materials  ·	Demonstrate PowerPoint shows and videos included with the curricula  The first course, called Survey of Psychiatric Rehabilitation, has four themes -- understanding psychiatric disability and current approaches to treatment, the mental health system and surrounding legal issues, psychiatric rehabilitation through vocational and skills training, and family and community support systems.  In the second course, Psychiatric Rehabilitation Skills, students learn how to implement skills training for behaviors like medication management, basic conversation, and symptom management. The Process Model for social and coping skills provides a foundation for understanding how basic skills are learned and performed. Employment has economic, social, and therapeutic opportunities for persons with severe mental illness. The third course, Vocational Rehabilitation and Community Living Skills, focuses on vocational rehabilitation, including supported employment, and skills needed for community case management. The fourth course, Health Skills for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, includes skills such as nutrition, sanitation, and safety information needed in psychiatric settings, to help persons working in the field of severe mental illness promote wellness through basic health skills.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer. (b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference. (c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled. (d) If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing. (e) Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:
	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                   ].

	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                          ]. * When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize and market ENERGY-10, Version 1.7, an award-winning PC-based design tool, that helps architects and building designers quickly identify the most cost-effective, energy-saving measures for commercial and residential buildings.  ENERGY-10 software can identify the best combination of energy-efficient strategies for buildings, including daylighting, passive solar heating, and high-efficiency mechanical systems.  Using ENERGY-10 at a project's start takes less than an hour and can result in energy savings of 40%–70%, with little or no increase in construction cost.  ENERGY-10 can be used to design buildings for energy efficiency and a superior indoor environment, including offices, schools, stores, banks, churches, and houses.  
ENERGY-10 is the software component of “Designing Low-Energy Buildings with ENERGY-10,” a collaborative project of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Center for Buildings and Thermal Systems, the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Berkeley Solar Group.  Any licensing relationship may include access to future enhancements of the software.  It is expected that the successful applicant for license rights will have the capabilities and commitment to enable broad distribution, training and support for the software use.  
License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  Information on technology transfer and patents available for licensing are available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by April 12, 2004, to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity, and reserves the right to withdraw this offer at any time.
Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Walter Copan, fax # 303-275-3040, or e-mail to walter_copan@nrel.gov

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize and market ENERGY-10, Version 1.7, an award-winning PC-based design tool, that helps architects and building designers quickly identify the most cost-effective, energy-saving measures for commercial and residential buildings.  ENERGY-10 software can identify the best combination of energy-efficient strategies for buildings, including daylighting, passive solar heating, and high-efficiency mechanical systems.  Using ENERGY-10 at a project's start takes less than an hour and can result in energy savings of 40%–70%, with little or no increase in construction cost.  ENERGY-10 can be used to design buildings for energy efficiency and a superior indoor environment, including offices, schools, stores, banks, churches, and houses.  
ENERGY-10 is the software component of “Designing Low-Energy Buildings with ENERGY-10,” a collaborative project of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Center for Buildings and Thermal Systems, the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Berkeley Solar Group.  Any licensing relationship may include access to future enhancements of the software.  It is expected that the successful applicant for license rights will have the capabilities and commitment to enable broad distribution, training and support for the software use.  
License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize and market ENERGY-10, Version 1.7, an award-winning PC-based design tool, that helps architects and building designers quickly identify the most cost-effective, energy-saving measures for commercial and residential buildings.  ENERGY-10 software can identify the best combination of energy-efficient strategies for buildings, including daylighting, passive solar heating, and high-efficiency mechanical systems.  Using ENERGY-10 at a project's start takes less than an hour and can result in energy savings of 40%–70%, with little or no increase in construction cost.  ENERGY-10 can be used to design buildings for energy efficiency and a superior indoor environment, including offices, schools, stores, banks, churches, and houses.  
ENERGY-10 is the software component of “Designing Low-Energy Buildings with ENERGY-10,” a collaborative project of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Center for Buildings and Thermal Systems, the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Berkeley Solar Group.

<DESC>The MAGTF Expeditionary Family of Fighting Vehicle (MEFFV) Office is conducting pre-ACAT analysis activities to support development of an acquistion program plan designed to meet the emerging program goals.  These analytical activities include comprehensive evaluation of the contributions and feasibility of Electromagnetic (EM) Weapons.

These activities are designed to provide insights for the analysis of alternatives for letahlity mechanisms.  The products of this effort will also be used in subsequent evaluation of the integration challenges of employing EM weapons on combat vehicles.  As the performer develops information regarding system trades, the MEFFV program office is responsible for coordinating a response on behalf of the combat developer.  This should ensure a cohesive and result-oriented technology investigation.

The contractor shall install two underwater cameras (provided as GFP), test their operation and provide sufficient training to NUWC personnel to operate the equipment.

However, all proposals received by March 17 will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>East Vallecito Fuels Reduction Project approximately 160 acres. This is a cooperative project between the USFS and the BOR.  The primary objective of the treatment in to restore the forest to a structure and composition similar to the pre-settlement range of variation and in so doing also reduce the risk of stand-replacement fire or other disturbance.

Within areas of predominant ponderosa pine the proposed treatment is a thinning to reduce basal area to a range of 80 to 100 square feet per acre favoring the larger and healthier trees and clumps.  Existing openings and clumpiness will be enhanced by the thinning. 

The proposal for the mixed conifer is a restoration treatment removing a majority of the white fir and some of the Douglas-fir and pine.  All white fir, Douglas-fir and small pine ladder fuels will be removed from around any pre-settlement pine or Douglas-fir.  Hazard and potential hazard trees could also be removed in the treatment. The residual basal area will be from 80 to 120 square feet per acre with emphasis on fire resistant species such as pine and larger Douglas-fir.  Some mature aspen with or without evidence of decay will also be removed in order to remove hazard trees and stimulate sprouting.  The areas along the creeks will be protected with a variable and staggered buffer strip of 25 to 50 feet.  Some small Douglas-fir and white fir will be left in the campgrounds to serve as screens between the campsites.

The merchantable trees to be removed will be individually marked.  Non-merchantable small trees, limbs and tops will be chipped on site and the chips spread on the ground to serve as mulch and sediment filter.  Small white fir killed by the Missionary Ridge Fire would also be chipped.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The United States, in conjunction with the Air Force, plans to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater utility systems at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.  The Request for Proposal is expected to be issued on or around March 19, 2004.  Please address all questions regarding this solicitation to Mily Le (703-767-2387 / mily.le@dla.mil) or Terri Workman (703-767-8130 / terri.workman@dla.mil).

System Descriptions: The following information is only an estimate of the size, scope, and general description of the electrical, natural gas, potable water, and sanitary wastewater utility systems at Tinker AFB and is subject to change.  Tinker AFB occupies approximately 5,000 acres of real estate and is located 8 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  It has 771 buildings and 730 family housing units containing 15.5 million square feet of floor space. 

Electrical: The electrical service is provided by Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) via a combination of overhead 138kV and 69kV lines.  Tinker AFB owns and operates three of four substations on base property; OG&E owns and operates the substation transformers at the remaining station.  Power is distributed at 12,470 volts to feed distribution transformers and other miscellaneous equipment.  The distribution system is of a loop-type and is sufficient for current base operations; however, minimal capacity exists for future expansion.  There are approximately 74,000 feet of overhead circuits and approximately 162,000 feet of underground circuits.

Natural Gas: Natural gas is provided by Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) at three individually-metered stations.  The distribution system consists of approximately 263,000 linear feet of underground piping, the majority of which is over 50 years old.  The system has steel pipe, some with cathodic protection, and polyethylene pipe.  Gas distribution is provided at a pressure of 45 psig or lower throughout the system, with military housing being provided at 17 psig.

Potable Water: Tinker AFB provides its own water from 23 wells located throughout the base.  These wells have a combined pumping capacity of 5148 gpm.  Water produced is stored in five water tanks with a combined capacity of three million gallons.  Water is also available from the City of Oklahoma City at two tie-in points: a 75psi 8-inch line and a 75-psi 10-inch line.  The distribution system is almost entirely decentralized and consists of approximately 562,000 linear feet of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, and VC piping as well as approximately 600 fire hydrants.

Sanitary Wastewater: The sanitary wastewater collection system consists of approximately 255,579 linear feet of clay, some lined with plastic, and PVC piping.  Manholes are both brick and concrete.  There are four lift stations integral to the collection system operation.  The sanitary waste stream is collected and metered prior to discharge to the City of Oklahoma City through a single 24-inch main.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NEC’s outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT – The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT – The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating country’s export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Government’s export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating country’s specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO REPLACE HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA BASIC ANNOUNCEMENT AND MODIFICATION 01 IN THEIR ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA MODIFICATION 02.

The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capabilities or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, the Deputy for Advanced Systems (MDA/AS) established the Advanced Systems Innovation Cell (ASIC) to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  The ASIC team consists of subject matter experts tasked with evaluating new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The ASIC seeks new and inventive concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following nine technology areas: 

(1)	Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Transmit/receive modules, Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; and Passive RF Systems; 
(2)	 Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Read-out electronics, Lethality Mechanisms; Laser Imaging with High Frame Rates, Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) testing of Multi-/Hyper-Spectral Sensors, HWIL testing of LADAR systems in a Thermal Vacuum Environment, test of ground, air, space, sea-based operations (all wavelengths will be considered); 
(3)	Mathematics and Computer Science including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Decision Systems, Estimation, Prediction, Homing Navigation, Data Fusion, Pattern Recognition, Identification, Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion and Distributed Systems for Scene Generation; 
(4)	Signal and Data Processing including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; 
(5)	Physics and Chemistry including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis;

(7)	Battle Management/Command and Control including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification; Aircraft mountable high bandwidth communications (T1 minimum with T3 or greater preferred) for line of sight and over the horizon data transfer; and Lethality Assessment Technologies, non-real-time, non-tactical (not kill assessment) test applications; and Discrimination and Fire Control; and 
(8)	High Altitude Airships technologies including platforms designs, subsystems, components and payloads, electrolyzers, fuel cells, Solar arrays;  
(9)ions.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (no more than five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) to the point of contact listed below.  

MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighted equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offerors’ capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.106).  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until January 31, 2006.  Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a final proposal will be requested.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2004 through FY 2006, and will most likely be a cost-plus-fixed fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.

(A11) See revision to solicitation below; (Q12) Will conduit be provided for the 100 pair cables that are to be installed between Rooms #119 and #219? (A12) See revision to solicitation below. The solicitation is hereby corrected as follows: (1) Remove: “pulling 28 100 pair cables between telephone closets;” Replace with: “pulling 10 100 pair cables between telephone closets;” (2) Remove: “labeling, dressing, and terminating 28 100 pair cables at MDF;” Replace with: “labeling, dressing, and terminating 10 100 pair cables at MDF;” (3) Remove: “labeling, dressing, and terminating 28 100 pair cables at IDF;” Replace with: “labeling, dressing, and terminating 10 100 pair cables at IDF.” The solicitation is hereby revised to incorporate the following: (1) Required Avaya equipment , as solicited, may be provided either as new or refurbished/warrantied-as-new; (2) The required expansion port network will be AC powered: 208 VAC, 60 HZ, single-phase; (3) Room #119 telephone closet is located directly below Room #219 telephone closet, with a distance of 17 feet between the true floor of Room #119 and the true floor of Room #219; (4) 3 existing conduits, each of 4” diameter, are dedicated as part of the building construction for receiving the required 10 100 pair cables between telephone closets; (5) The current software release of the existing Avaya Definity G3r telephone switch is R011r.03.0.526.5; (6) As solicited, the contractor shall be responsible for punching-down the 1,000 CAT5E cables onto the IDF’s that originate from the wall and floor jacks in Rooms #119 and #219.

S. citizens and in possession of proper identification, such as a valid driver’s license; (8) The contractor’s hardware installation technicians must hold valid and current Avaya Incorporated certification of training in installation and troubleshooting of Avaya Definity G3r; and (9) The contractor’s terminal board/cabling installers must hold valid and current Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) certification from Building Industry Consulting Service International, Inc.

The new webcast vendor will only have to support the previous archived webcasts transferred from NIH in the Real Networks format.   However, all  "new" webcasts (not previous webcasts transferred from NIH) that the new webcast vendor broadcasts to viewers for the first time (either "Live" or as an archived version from an NRC videotape) will be required to be broadcast in both RealNetworks and a 2nd viewing software format, in any combination of streaming rates listed in the SOW;   

QUESTION #3:	Also, what are the existing file bitrates and if they are in Real Media format, how were they created: G2, other?

RESPONSE #3:	The existing files (archived webcasts) are all encoded in RealNetworks SureStream format which supports the 28.8kbps, 56kbps and 150kbps bitrates specified in the SOW.

(2)   FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
	
	"Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet"

PART TWO (2) Continuation of SOW from Modification Number 1.

Task-3		PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR NRC "LIVE" WEBCASTS:

Requirement:	The contractor shall broadcast the NRC Commission meetings over the Internet as they take place.  For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text).   The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage.

		During each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall continuously monitor the webcast to ensure any disruptions in the availability of viewing-access to the webcast by Internet viewers are prevented.  In the event of a problem with the webcast infrastructure, the Contractor shall immediately respond to minimize the impact of the problem on the webcast viewers ability to access the NRC webcasts.

		If the NRC-PO requests, the contractor shall provide support to perform tests 
		of the webcast system at any time between 6:00am-6:00pm EST each weekday.  In addition, beginning one-hour prior to the actual scheduled start of an NRC meeting to be webcast "live", the contractor shall continuously test the webcast system infrastructure to ensure the system  is "fully operational" and ready to generate a high-quality webcast when the meeting begins.
  
Date of Delivery:	The contractor shall establish the capability to support NRC "live" webcasts within 30-days after contract award, and thereafter shall provide support for NRC "test" and "live" webcasts with 24-hours of advance notice from the NRC-PO.

Task-3.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall provide viewers with access to a high-quality webcast during each NRC "test" and "live" webcast.  
Task-3.a.  NRC Standard:	The contractor shall provide uninterrupted viewer access for   each NRC "test" and "live" webcast, when NRC provides at least 24-hours of advance notice.  The contractor shall prevent any interruption in the availability of the webcast to viewers or alteration of the webcast content received from NRC.  The Contractor shall ensure the webcast is optimized for Internet viewers video/audio clarity, including any adjustments needed to enhance the clarity of the closed-caption text.
Task-3.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each "test" and "live" webcast by monitoring the webcast via the Internet during the entire webcast.

Guidance:	NRC will determine which NRC meetings will be webcast "live" and/or which will be webcast as an "archived" version.  For each "live" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor with access to a "live" feed of the meeting from the NRC videotape system. 

		In the event of a disruption or unavaiely thirty (30) 2-hour webcasts in CD-ROM format.   During each year of the contract, NRC estimates that one 2-hour video-tape of an NRC meeting will need converted to archive within 24-hours and one 2-hour video-tape will need converted to archive within 4-hours.

QUESTION #12 =	Is chat (for questions from audience) and polling required for the live webcast?
RESPONSE #12 =	Chat is not required.  The NRC does require the new webcast webpage to enable the viewers to complete and submit the NRC's multiple-choice "viewer survey" and also enable viewers to submit an e-mail with their comments and/or questions.  Refer to the section in the SOW for developing and hosting the webpage. 

QUESTION #13 =	Is there a dedicated TV-1 Fiber connection on site and available 
for this project at the meeting facility?
RESPONSE #13 =	No.  There is not a dedicated TV-1 Fiber connection on site and available for this project.

QUESTION #14 =	Will the incumbent vendor be bidding on this contract?
RESPONSE #14 =	No.  The incumbent vendor is another federal agency (National Institutes of Health - NIH) and this procurement is being competed as a Small-Business Set-a-Side. 

QUESTION #15 =	Will the meetings be in the same room each time?
RESPONSE #15 =	Normally, yes.  However, wherever the meetings are on the NRC campus, the NRC will provide the same Composite Video Feed over a RG6 coaxial cable down to the same fixed point in the NRC facility (P1-11 telephone room) each time.   At that fixed point in the NRC facility (P1-11 telephone room), the contractor shall be provided on-site space for the minimum on-site equipment needed to connect to the coaxial cable's RF connector, encode the signal and transmit the signal to the vendor's offsite webcasting facility over the dedicated line provided by the vendor.







QUESTION #16 =	What is the reason for switching contractors?
RESPONSE #16 =	NRC is currently obtaining this webcasting support from another federal agency (National Institutes Of Health - NIH) under an Inter-Agency Agreement until a contract with a Small Business can be established. 

QUESTION #17 =	Will the A/V equipment remain on-site, or is the existing contractor removing?
RESPONSE #17 =	The existing Contractor (NIH) has no AV equipment onsite.  The AV equipment on-site at NRC is owned and operated by NRC.  Refer to the RESPONSE to Question #4.

QUESTION #18 =	May we offer an alternative solution to encoding on-site?
RESPONSE #18 =	No, propose a solution that meets the Statement of Work (SOW).

QUESTION #19 =	Is the one hour test included in the archive, and if so, why?
RESPONSE #19 =	No, the archive only includes the actual NRC meeting being webcast and not any pre-meeting testing.

QUESTION #20 =	Also, there is reference in 0007 to 160 units and in 0008 to 120 units - can you explain how you arrived at these totals?
RESPONSE #20 =	Refer to the above revised estimates and pricing breakdown shown in the above revised pricing schedule.  The initial load of up to thirty old archived webcasts (averaging 2-hours in duration) into the new webcast webpage shall be included in the cost of CLIN #0005 above for developing the Webcast Webpage. The revised calculation is as follows: Live-webcast: QTY 320 half hours (estimated live webcast -40 time 4 hours live(with tests) equal 160 annual hours times 2 equal 320 half hours); Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 156 half-hours annually (from live within 24 hours- estimated 39 meetings times 2 hours (no tests) equal 78 hours annually times 2 equal 156 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from live within 4 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from VHS within 24 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from VHS within 4 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);

QUESTION #21 =	In Modification 1 you ask for a minimum 100 streams at 150kbps. 
How many concurrent streams are required for 56K and 28.8? 
RESPONSE #21 =	The requirement to support up to 100 concurrent streams at 150kbps is an estimate of the maximum bandwidth the NRC expects the public to be able to pull from the webcasting facility.  At any one point in time, the webcast provider shall support at least 100 concurrent users in any combination of the specified streaming rates of 150Kbps, 56Kbps and 28.8Kbps.

QUESTION #22 =	Can you provide a list of the AV equipment on-site and is it possible for us to have an on-site inspection prior to the bid?
RESPONSE #22 =	The list of AV equipment on-site is not needed to bid on this requirement since NRC will provide and operate all on-site AV videography equipment.  The webcast provider will only need to provide the necessary equipment on-site to connect to the NRC's AV output (composite video feed) connection point (NRC building P1-11 telephone room), encode the signal content and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure over the dedicated telecom line provided by the webcast vendor.  Vendor walk-through of NRC's facilities was completed on 3/13/2003.

QUESTION #23 = 	Who is currently providing this service?
RESPONSE #23 =	Refer to the RESPONSE to question #16.



QUESTION #24 =	Is there a requirement/desire to synchronize the powerpoint slides 
with the video of the meeting?
RESPONSE #24 =	No.  

QUESTION #25 =	Is there a requirement/desire to provide the ability to search the contents of the slides and/or the content of the closed-captioning?
RESPONSE #25 =	No.

QUESTION #26 =	Is Microsoft Media considered equivalent to Real Networks video or 
is there a preference for Real Networks?
RESPONSE #26 =	Refer to the RESPONSE provided for Question #3.

QUESTION #27 =	Do you have any preferred methods for the live delivery of streaming formats?
				A) QuickTime 
B) Windows media player 
C) Real Networks 
D) All of the above must be supplied. 
RESPONSE #27 =	Refer to the RESPONSE provided for Question #3.

QUESTION #28 =	Have these services been performed before?
RESPONSE #28 =	Yes.  Refer to the RESPONSE provided for Question #16.

QUESTION #29 =	Do you have any specifications on your preferences for streaming bit 
rates?
RESPONSE #29 =	Yes.  Refer to the RESPONSE provided for Question #21.     

QUESTION #30 =	What is your target audience using at an average for web connectivity? 
				A) 28.8/56k modems
				B) DSL
				C) cable
				D) T1 
RESPONSE #30 =	The majority of the target audience is the general public and they view our webcasts via a mixture of all of the above.  Those webcast viewers with modems may consume the 28.8kbps and 56kbps feeds, while the 150kbps feeds are for viewers with DSL, cable, and T1 Internet service.

QUESTION #31 =	On average, how many concurrent viewers (at the same time) do you
			expect to have viewing the video stream at one point in time?
				A) 0 to 100 concurrent users
				B) 100 - 500
				C) 500 - 1000
				D) 1000 - 3000
				E) 3000 - 5000
				F) 5k -10k
				G) 10K + 
RESPONSE #31 =	A) 0 to 100 concurrent users



QUESTION #32 =	What is the estimated number of individuals that normally follow up or 
are interested in the information you provide.
RESPONSE #32 =	Refer to the RESPONSE to Question #1.

QUESTION #33 =	Out of that figure how many users do you estimate would like to view 
the conferences online whether on-demand or live?
RESPONSE #33 =	Refer to the RESPONSE to Question #1.

QUESTION #34 =	Is a "dedicated" connection required between NRC Headquarters and the 
potential Contractor's Webcast System Center for the transmittal of the 
encoded video content or can the Internet be used as the transmission 
medium? Either way is fine, but we wanted clarification as one method is 
more costly than the other.
RESPONSE #34 =	A "dedicated" connection is required between the NRC Headquarters building in Rockville, Maryland and the potential Contractor's Webcast System Center for the transmittal of the encoded video content.

QUESTION #35 =	Additionally, can the video feed be provided as an "S-Video" or 
Composite link from your current equipment or will we need a NTSC Scan 
Converter?
RESPONSE #35 =	The NRC will provide the AV signal output for each webcast as a Composite Video Feed.

QUESTION #36 =	Does the NRC wish to have the Webcasting infrastructure built for them?  We took a look at the current Webcasts and it looks like the infrastructure has already been built but the solicitation reads as though this is something that still needs to be done.
RESPONSE #36 =	The NRC videotapes each meeting to be webcast and provides the content to the off-site webcast provider in the form of a Composite Video Feed.  The current off-site webcast provider is the NIH which provides all the required webcasting infrastructure and support for NRC webcasts from the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  The new webcast vendor will provide all webcast infrastructure and support to connect to the NRC's Composite Video Feed at the NRC building's P1-11 telephone room and accomplish all other requirements of the NRC SOW.   

QUESTION #37 =	Do you know what your average monthly transfer rates have been over the past couple years?
RESPONSE #37 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #21.

QUESTION #38 =	Can you give us the average size of your footprint?
RESPONSE #38 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #21.

RESPONSE#5: The offeror must submit the following material which will constitute its offer:  
(a)  Part 1 - Solicitation Package/Offer - Vendor transmittal letter signed by a duly authorized company representative which constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions of the contract.
(b)  Part II -PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS -- TECHNICAL  -- Submit one (1) original and two (2) copies of the "Technical Proposal which addresses:  CORPORATE EXPERIENCE: The offeror shall discuss how well its proposal demonstrates corporate experience. Describe, in general terms, corporate qualifications and experience in performing the same or similar work as required in the SOW Section of this solicitation the firm and any of its proposed subcontractors have performed over the past five years.  Include the number of years the firm has been in business and company growth history (personnel and dollars).  List any current commitments with other organizations, Government and/or commercial, for the same or similar effort. PAST PERFORMANCE:  Offerors shall provide past performance information that includes recent and relevant information for a minimum of two contracts performed over the past five (5) years for efforts accomplished in similar size and scope to the NRC's effort.  This information shall include contract number, dollar value, point of contact with a current telephone number and a brief synopsis of the services performed.  
(c)  Part III - PROPOSAL REQUIREMENT - PRICING - Submit one (1) original and two (2) copies of the "Cost Proposal which includes completing the pricing schedule.  An offeror's cost proposal shall reflect all costs necessary to perform the work reflected in this effort.   The offeror shall submit an overall cost proposal for the entire period of performance (base period and option periods).
(d)  Part IV -REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - Offeror must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 (October 2000) Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.

QUESTION#6:  Is there a particular standard form on which we should complete the provision at 52.212-3?  I've noted at www.arnet.gov/far what language must be included, but didn't know if there's an actual form to use or whether we should generate the elements of a form ourselves on our own letterhead, for example.
RESPONSE#6: The format for the certification is in FAR 52.212-3. There is not a separate form for this. Most offerors print a copy of the clause FAR 52.212-3 and complete the certification questions on the printed FAR clause. The marked-up FAR clause is submitted as the certification.  For example see paragraph (b) Taxpayer Identification Number of the clause. You will note that item number  (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) shown below leaves a place to write in the TIN or circle the statement that applies.  "o  TIN: _____________________. 

QUESTION#7: Are there any forms or representations that we need to provide with our proposal that relate to FAR 52.212-5 and the additional applicable clauses, or to the INS compliance?  Or would any such forms or representations be required following award of contract instead?
RESPONSE#7: There are no forms to complete in relationship to FAR 52.212-5. By your firm submitting a proposal in which you do not take any exceptions to clause FAR 52.212-5 indicates that you are accepting the Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders- Commercial Items. There is nothing additional to submit with your proposal.

QUESTION#8:  Regarding RS-ADM-03-161, modification 4, amendment 2, there seems to be a minor discrepancy involving CLIN 0017 and Option Period One.  CLIN 0017 is a repeat of CLIN 0016.  There is no CLIN under Option Period One for "CONVERSION of an NRC meeting from a VHS-tape into ARCHIVED format on an URGENT basis within 4-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held." Since such a CLIN exists in Base Period and Option periods Two, Three and Four, it would seem that a CLIN for such a service should be under Option Period One as well.
RESPONSE#8: See item number 1) of this amendment.


(3)   FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER. 

(4)  Nothing follows.

CLIN 0015)  LIVE BROAlability of the NRC's "live" feed, NRC will provide the Contractor with a VHS tape of the meeting for use in adding the meeting to the webpage as an archived webcast.  

		As part of the pre-webcast setup before each "live" webcast, NRC reserves the right to schedule the Contractor to perform a "test" webcast (usually the day before each scheduled "live" webcast).  During the test webcast, the Contractor shall establish a separate URL-address for NRC personnel to view the test webcast via the Internet in order to verify that all systems are working at optimum levels, and if not, to allow time before the scheduled "live" webcast for the Contractor to make any necessary system adjustments.  Additionally, the day of each scheduled NRC "live" webcast, the Contractor shall participate in another similar test webcast, to enable NRC to provide a test feed to the Contractor as part of the setup for the actual "live" webcast, beginning 60-minutes before the scheduled start of the meeting.  This will enable NRC personnel to verify via the Internet that all systems are still working at optimum levels and ensure the connection carrying the "live" feed from NRC to the Contractor is working properly before the actual meeting begins. 


Task-4		PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR NRC "ARCHIVED" WEBCASTS:

Requirement:	Provide conversion of approximately 40 NRC "live" webcasts annually (each averaging 3-hours in duration) into an "archived" format to allow any user on   the Internet the ability to view previous NRC webcasts on a "on-demand" basis, 24-hours a day, 7-days-week, during the contract period. 

		Provide capacity to concurrently support up to 120 NRC archived webcasts during the contract  period (each averaging 3-hours in duration).

		The Contractor shall provide viewers with uninterrupted "on-demand" access to any meeting at any time during the contract.

		The Contractor shall add all NRC "live" webcasts to the webcast webpage within 24-hours after the "live" webcast's completion.   If NRC designates a meeting is to be converted into "archived" format on an "urgent" basis, the contractor shall complete the archival of the meeting and make it available for viewers to access within 4-hours after either the completion of the "live" webcast or the Contractor receiving a VHS-tape of the meeting from NRC.

		The contractor shall notify the NRC-PO by e-mail when each webcast has been successfully converted into an "archived" format and is ready for viewers to access from the webcast webpage. 

		As in the current NRC webcast webpage, archived webcasts shall be listed on the webpage in chronological order with the most recent webcast listed first.  

		Provide long-term archival of NRC webcasts consisting of transferring each meeting's webcast onto a Compact Disk (CD) after the conclusion of it's usual 12-month period of availability on the Webpage as an archived webcast, and delivery of the CD to the NRC-PO.

		While each webcast is available for viewing from the webcast Web Page, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of NRC and non-NRC "unique viewers" accessing the webcast during each calendar month that the meeting is available for "archived" viewing.
	
Date of Delivery:	The contractor shall establish the capability to convert NRC meetings into an archived format for "on-demand" viewing from the webcast webpage within 30-days after contract award.  All NRC "live" webcasts shall be converted and added to the webcast webpage's "archived" access within 24-hours of the "live" webcast's completion.  For "urgent" conversions into the "archived" access availability, the Contractor shall provide "archived" viewing access to the webcast within 4-hours after either the completion of the "live" webcast or the Contractor receiving a VHS-tape of a meeting and/or event from NRC (in case the meeting or event was not webcast "live" originally, or there was any interruption or disruption in the "live" feed from NRC).  

			Deliver an "archived" version of each webcast to the NRC-PO, stored in a CD-ROM format, within 30-calendar-days of the initial "live" webcast of the meeting.	

Task-4.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall convert all NRC "live" webcasts, and other NRC meetings designated for conversion by NRC, and make them available for "on-demand" viewing from the webcast webpage.
Task-4.a.  NRC Standard:	The Contractor shall convert meetings and make them available within the standard 24-hour time frame or the 4-hour "urgent" time frame, as designated by the NRC-PO.  Each "archived" webcast shall be available for uninterrupted "on-demand" viewing access for at least 23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.   
Task-4.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each archived webcast upon notification by the contractor of the completion of the meeting's conversion into "archived" format availability.  The NRC-PO will also investigate any complaints received from viewers regarding their inability to access any NRC "archived" webcast in order to determine whether the contractor failed to comply with the minimum 23-hour per calendar-day level of "on-demand" access availability required by NRC.

Guidance:	In the event of a disruption in the "live" webcast feed, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS-tape of the meeting for use in archiving the webcast.

		NRC will require most "live" webcasts to be converted to an "archived" version and added to the webcasting webpage within 24-hours of the actual meeting's conclusion.  Occasionally, NRC will require a "live" webcast or other NRC meeting to be converted to an "archived" format and added to the webcast webpage on an "urgent" basis  (within 4-hours of the Contractor receiving either the "live" feed of the webcast or a VHS tape of the meeting).    

		The NRC will determine the length of time each webcast is kept available for viewing from the webcast webpage.

		NOTE: NRC will provide the Contractor with an archived version of the previous NRC webcasts (approximately thirty (30) 3-hour meetings) in CD-ROM format  for inclusion in the new webcast webpage.  NRC requires webcasts to remain available as an archived version until NRC is satisfied they have served their intended purpose (usually for 12-months after the "live" webcast of the meeting or the date the webcast was added to the webcast website, whichever was later).

Task-5		NETWORK SECURITY

Requirement:	The contractor shall provide "Maximum Network Security" for NRC webcasts including submission of a "webcast security plan" to the NRC-PO within 2-weeks  of the date of award, which explains the methodology to be used by the contractor to consistently achieve it.  If upon NRC's review, a weakness is revealed in the Contractor ?s proposed "webcast security plan", the Contractor shall make the necessary adjustments required to mitigate the weakness.

Date of Delivery:	The Contractor shall provide a "webcast security plan" to the NRC-PO within 2-weeks after the date of award, and establish "Maximum Network Security" for the webcast infrastructure within 30-days after the date of contract award. 

Task-5.a.  NRC Measure:	The contractor shall comply with the NRC requirement for "Maximum Network Security".
Task-5.a.  NRC Standard:	"Maximum Network Security" is achieved during the contract  period by:
					a.  Prevention of any interruption in the availability of NRC
					     "live" webcasts to Internet viewers; 
					b.  Prevention of any interruption in the availability of NRC
					     "archived" webcasts to Internet viewers, during at least
					     23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day,
					     and;
					c.  Prevention of any corruption or alteration of NRC
					     webcast data by unauthorized sources. 	
Task-5.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will coordinate an NRC review of the Contractor ?s "webcast security plan" and provide the Contractor any comments/questions and/or weaknesses found.  Further, the NRC-PO will inspect each "live" webcast during the webcast to verify the webcast is not interrupted, corrupted and/or altered in any way by unauthorized sources.  The NRC-PO will investigate any complaint from viewers that could be a result of the Contractor failing to maintain "Maximum Network Security", during the contract period. 

Guidance:	None


Task-6		DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING

Requirement:	During each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of NRC and non-NRC "unique viewers" who access the webcast during the meeting (the tracking of "unique viewers" does not count the same viewer more than once if they access the same "live" webcast multiple times) and provide the data to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of the conclusion of the webcast.
	  
		For each "archived" webcast, the Contractor shall collect data on the number of "unique viewers" accessing the webcast during each calendar-month period, and provide the data to the NRC-PO within 10-calendar-days after conclusion of the month. 

		For each e-mail response received from viewers with comments and/or questions on the NRC webcast program, the Contractor shall forward the viewer responses to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of receipt from the viewer.  
		
		For each viewer webcast survey response submitted, the Contractor shall forward the survey response to the NRC-PO within 24-hours of receipt from the viewer. 

Date of Delivery:	Provide the webcast viewer data and/or responses by e-mail to the   NRC-PO within the delivery-time specified above in Task-6, for each type of information.  

Task-6.a.  NRC Measure:	The Contractor shall accurately collect the viewer data/responses and forward them to the NRC-PO within the specified delivery-time. 

Task-6.a.  NRC Standard:	"Unique viewer" data provided to the NRC-PO shall accurately reflect the viewing audience of NRC webcasts.  All viewer questions, comments and survey responses received by the Contractor shall be forwarded to the NRC-PO within the designated time frame and complete. 
Task-6.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect all viewer data and viewer responses received from the Contractor. 



V.  	OVERALL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND DEDUCTION SCHEDULE:
	The following processes will be used by NRC to motivate successful performance of the contract requirements stated herein:

	Failure by the Contractor to comply with any of the procedures and/or contract requirements stated herein shall constitute a "valid-deficiency" under this contract, unless the failure can be shown to be caused by circumstances beyond the Contractor's control.  

	No more than one (1) contract-deficiency shall be allowed by NRC per calendar-month period, in which the NRC-PO determines the discrepancy is a "valid-deficiency" for   non-compliance with any Contract Requirements.                              

	The Contractor shall invoice monthly with a single invoice that includes a breakdown of the cost of all support provided during the previous calendar-month's period.  For any month in which the Contractor fails to comply with the contract requirements stated herein, NRC reserves the right to deduct the following amounts from that month's total monthly invoice payment:

		0-1	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in no deduction;
		   2	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 5% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   3	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 6% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   4	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 7% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   5	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 8% of the total monthly invoice being deducted;
		   6	Valid-deficiency's per calendar-month period will result in 10% of the total monthly invoice being deducted.
		
	NOTE: Under the Performance Incentives listed above, NRC will not deduct more than a 
	            total of 10% from the monthly invoice.   	

	The deductions listed above do not prevent NRC from taking other appropriate actions to correct performance problems under this contract.


VI.    	MEETINGS AND TRAVEL: 
 	The contractor shall attend an initial meeting with the NRC staff within 3-workdays after the contract is awarded.  The meeting will take place at NRC headquarters to provide clarification of any questions, concerns and expectations.  

 
VII.     NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT:
 	The NRC will provide the contractor onsite access for initial installation setup and shall provide limited space and power connection for the contractor's equipment.  The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.


VIII.    RIGHTS IN DATA: 
	NRC shall retain non-exclusive ownership and rights for all NRC meeting webcasts and their contents.


IX.   	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
	The base period is 12-months from date or award with four one-year option periods.


X.   	INVOICES/BILLING:
	Billing reports shall be submitted to the NRC PO monthly describing the services provided and the cost related to each service.  The monthly bill shall be consistent with the contract "pricing schedule".  In addition to the invoice specifying the line-item being billed, the invoice shall state the date(s) service performed.  For each "live" webcast, the invoice shall include the date of the webcast, webcast description listed on the NRC Homepage, the length of the webcast and its total cost.

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. The purpose of this modification is to add part 1 of attachment number 2 entitled "DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT, Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet." Part number 1 of Attachment number 2 follows:  

                                                                                            Attachment No. 2

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
	
	"Broadcasting NRC Commission Meetings On The Internet"

PART ONE (1)
 I.   BACKGROUND: 

	One of the primary goals of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is to make available to the public, full and complete information on NRC's activities to assist the public in making informed judgements regarding NRC activities.  The primary means of keeping the public informed about the regulatory activities and programs of the NRC is through the news media.  The NRC informs the media by:  issuing and posting on the Web news releases, speeches and fact sheets; distributing reports, decisions and other documents reflecting NRC actions; giving press conferences and talking with editorial boards of major newspapers around the country; responding to media questions after Commission meetings, staff meetings with licensees, plant visits, special inspections and other significant meetings; and talking to the media in person or by telephone.  

	Since March of 2000, NRC has offered the public, industry, and other NRC stakeholders access to monitoring Commission meetings over the Internet (webcasting). Under this initiative, designated Commission meetings are made available for remote access by Internet viewers "live" (as they take place) and/or "archived" (digital recordings of previously held meetings).  NRC currently obtains webcasting support described herein under an Interagency Agreement (IA) with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), IA number  NRC-10-02-144. 


II.   CONTRACT OBJECTIVE:

	The contractor shall provide experienced staff to support the creation and maintenance of the NRC webcast website and management of the technical aspects of NRC's webcasts.  The Contractor shall also provide the hardware, software, and telecommunication services to achieve complete and clear webcasting of NRC meetings via the Internet.  The contractor shall monitor all equipment remotely and  shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.


III.   SCOPE OF WORK:

	The contractor shall capture the audio and video content of Commission meetings from NRC's Commission Hearing Room audiovisual system, encode the content, and transmit the content to the contractor's technical infrastructure from which the Contractor shall make it available to the public, free of charge.  The contractor shall have a commitment to quality, customer service and providing the greatest number of viewers the fastest access possible to the NRC webcasts via the Internet. 

	The contract support shall include: (webpage development & maintenance, technical expertise, hardware, software, telecommunications services, Internet bandwidth, primary and backup servers, backup power, "viewing-software" user-Licenses, etc.) required to provide all interested parties with reliable access to NRC webcasts during the contract period.  

	The NRC estimates that a total of 40-meetings annually will be webcast "live", with an average length of support for each "live" webcast of 4-hours, including:
		A.  1-hour of pre-meeting testing the day before each webcast;
		B.  1-hour of pre-meeting testing the day of the webcast (just before the
		      start of the actual meeting);
		C.  2-hour usual duration of the actual meeting.    

	Upon completion of each "live" webcast, the Contractor shall add the webcast to the webcast webpage as an "archived" webcast, and provide viewers access to it on an   "on-demand" basis, 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, for up to 12-months.

	Occasionally, NRC will provide the Con

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. 
The combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161 is amended as set forth below.  NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The hour and date specified for receipt of responses remains 3/28/03 at 3:00 p.m. local time.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 3. Response to vendor technical questions will be responded to during the week of 3/24/2003.  Revision to the receipt of responses date will be addressed at that time.

(2)  Following are responses to questions: 

QUESTION#1: The solicitation is listed as a small business set aside.  You mentioned Streampipe at the tour.  Since they have been purchased by Loudeye, a large publicly owned corporation on the stock exchange, will they be one of the competing vendors?  Can we get a list of competing vendors?
 RESPONSE#1: Large business may not participate in this solicitation as a prime.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted only by small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Under this solicitation, we do not have a list of competing vendor until a proposal is submitted. After receipt of proposals the vendor list becomes procurement sensitive information which is not released to the public during the acquisition process.


QUESTION#2:  The announcement states that proposals are to be delivered by 12:00 Noon on March 12, 2003 (Now 3:00pm March 28, 2003). The announcement also states that: "All offerors shall allow extra time for internal mail distribution." Can you provide an idea of how much "extra time" to allow?  Should we deliver our bid by 3:30 PM the night before, March 11? At 7:30 AM
on March 12? At 9:30 AM on March 12? I will hand deliver the proposal to NRC on March 28,2003. What is the process and time required to insure that we are in compliance with the due
date?

The combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161 is amended as set forth below.  NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The hour and date specified for receipt of responses remains 3/28/03 at 3:00 p.m. local time.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined sysnopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 3.  The above numbered combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to respond to vendor questions.  Accordingly, ADM-03-161 is amended as follows:

(1)  Following are responses to questions: 


QUESTION #1 = 	How many viewers are expected for each webcast? 
RESPONSE #1 = 	100 concurrent viewers.

QUESTION #2 = 	What are the required encoding rates?
RESPONSE #2 = 	The SOW states "Enable all webcasts to be viewed at 150Kbps, 56Kbps and 28.8 Kbps".

QUESTION #3 = 	What formats for the video stream are required?
RESPONSE #3 = 	This is a vendor business decision. However, the SOW states "Provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the equivalent software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website.

QUESTION #4 = 	Does this include videography or will we take an audio and video 
feed from NRC equipment?
RESPONSE #4 =	No. NRC will perform all videography, creation of the closed-captioning for the "live" webcasts, and combine the video/audio and closed captioning into a single Composite Video Feed.  NRC will deliver the Composite Video Feed to the NRC building P1-11 telephone room during each "test" or "Live" webcast. The vendor shall be responsible for providing a dedicated telecommunications line to get the webcast signal from the NRC's P1-11 telephone room to the vendor's webcasting system. See the RESPONSE to Question #15.
 
QUESTION #5 =	Will the presentations include Powerpoint slides and graphics? 
RESPONSE #5 =	Yes, the presentations will include powerpoint slides and graphics.

QUESTION #6 =	Do the presentations require compliance with rule 508? 
RESPONSE #6 =	Yes, the presentations require compliance with rule 508.

QUESTION #7 =	What are the existing Internet, satellite and fiber connectivity 
infrastructure capabilities?
RESPONSE #7 =	Bidders should propose a solution that provides a dedicated line between the NRC Audio-Visual equipment output point (NRC building P1-11 telephone room) and the Bidder's webcasting facility.  Do not plan on using existing NRC Internet, satellite or fiber connectivity.

QUESTION #8 =	If we have access to an internet broadband connection, what is 
the minimum "dedicated" bandwidth that would be available?
RESPONSE #8 =	This is not an option.  Bidders should propose a dedicated line.

QUESTION #9 =	Do you require video webcasts or audio only?
RESPONSE #9 =	We require video webcasts.

QUESTION #10 =	Is any lighting or audio equipment required for the bid?
RESPONSE #10 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #4.  No lighting or audio equipment is required for the bid.

QUESTION #11 =	How many hours of content are expected for meetings or events 
that are NOT live webcast, but that need to be converted from video tape 
to internet library?
RESPONSE #11 =	Initially, to establish the list of archived previous webcasts on the new webcast provider's webpage, NRC will provide the new webcast provider with approximattractor a video (in either VHS, CD Rom or DVD format) of an NRC event that was not webcast "live" and require the Contractor to add  it to the list of archived webcasts on the webpage, for viewers to access on an 
	"on-demand" basis.

		each meeting.

		11.  Provide capacity to host the NRC's webcast webpage.

		12.  Provide viewers with access to a webcast in which viewers can easily identify the participants at the meeting, understand the meeting's discussions, read the closed-caption text and any exhibits used during the meeting.  

		13.  The Contractor shall provide the NRC-PO with a toll-free telephone number and an e-mail address for the NRC-PO's use in placing orders to the Contractor for upcoming "test", "live" and "archived" webcast support services.

Date of Delivery:	Within 30-days of the date of contract award. 

Task-1.a.   NRC Measure: 	The Contractor shall provide the "fully operational" webcast infrastructure system within 30-days of the date of award. 
Task-1.a.   NRC Standard:	For initial acceptance of the system, the Contractor shall conduct a "test" webcast of an NRC meeting and any other tests necessary to clearly demonstrate to NRC the system's full compliance with the requirements stated herein in Task-1 for being "fully operational".  During the test webcast there shall be no interruption in the availability of the webcast to viewers.    
Task-1.a.   NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect the initial "test" webcast and also participate in testing the required system capacities and viewer feedback features that are required by NRC under Task-1, for the system to be "fully operational".


Task-1.b.  NRC Measure:	During each calendar-month period of the contract, the Contractor shall ensure the entire system is kept "fully operational" during each "test" and "live" webcast.
Task-1.b.  NRC Standard:	During "test' and "live" webcasts, the Contractor shall ensure the system continuously complies with all requirements for being  "fully operational".  No complaints shall be received from webcast viewers that the NRC-PO determines are a result of the system failing to be kept "fully operational".  No inspections by the NRC-PO shall reveal the system is not being kept "fully operational". 
Task-1.b.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will inspect each "test" and "live" webcast by monitoring the entire webcast via the Internet, in order to verify the entire system is kept "fully operational" and without interruptions in webcast access to viewers.  Further, the NRC-PO will investigate each complaint received from webcast viewers to determine if the complaint results from the webcast system failing to be "fully operational".


Task-1.c.  NRC Measure:	During each calendar-month period, the Contractor shall ensure that viewers:
					A.  Have access to the "archived" webcasts;
					B.  Are able to provide NRC with comments/questions
					     about NRC webcasts; and
					C.  Are able to respond to the NRC webcast survey.

				activity, viewer survey responses and viewer comments and/or questions.  During these periods, the Contractor shall ensure that interruptions to the webcast system's status of being "fully operational" are kept to a minimum.  
Task-1.c.  NRC Standard:	During each calendar-day (24-hours), the Contractor shall ensure that viewers can access the archived webcasts, provide NRC with comments/questions about NRC webcasts and respond to the NRC survey during at least 23-hours out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.  Further, the Contractor shall ensure that interruptions to the webcast system's collection of  "unique viewer" activity data shall not exceed a total of 1-hour out of the 24-hours in each calendar-day.  
Task-1.c.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	The NRC-PO will investigate any complaint received from webcast viewers to determine if the cause of the complaint is due to the contractor's webcast infrastructure failing to comply with the NRC requirements for being "fully operational".

Guidance:	None



Task-2		DEVELOP/HOST WEBPAGE AND PROVIDE
	           MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT:

Requirement:	Develop and host a webpage.  The  webpage shall be the host site for NRC webcast viewers to gain access to "live" and/or "archived" webcasts of NRC meetings via the Internet during the contract period.  To ensure compatibility and a consistent appearance and functionality of the Contractor ?s webcast webpage with NRC's other webpages, the Contractor shall use the current webcast webpage developed by NIH as the model for developing the new webcast webpage. (Visit www.nrc.gov. and click on "Live NRC Meeting Webcast and Webcast Archive.")
		
		To be "fully operational" the  webpage shall:

		1.   Be written in "standard HTML" that complies with section 508 of the  Rehabilitation Act (for specific guidance refer to http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm ), and have no "HTML-links" that begin with a "dot-slash" or "dot-dot-slash" (e.g. ./ or ../).
		  
		2.   Provide the user (webcast viewers) with a webpage (including URL address) that will provide dynamically-generated content as follows: 
			a.  During scheduled times when there is no webcast in progress, 
			     a message so indicating, displayed for several seconds followed 
			     by an automatic transfer back to the prior (NRC) webpage; 
			b.  During scheduled times when an NRC-originated webcast is in
			     progress, a message so indicating, displayed for several seconds 
			     followed by an automatic launch of the webcast URL and then a 
			     transfer back to the prior (NRC) webpage; 
			c.  In either case (a & b) above, the automated launch and transfers 
			    shall also be provided as ordinary HTML hyperlinks, for users with
			    browsers which do not process automated transfers.

		3.   Accurately identify all NRC meetings available for viewing including whether the meeting is an upcoming or current "live" webcast, or an "archive" version of a  previous meeting or webcast.  For each upcoming "live" webcast, the Contractor shall use information provided by the NRC-PO to notify viewers of the scheduled date, time and description of the meeting to be webcast.  

		4.   Allow any other Web-site to "link" to the NRC meeting webcast webpage without  any "charge" (cost).  Sites that could be expected to seek such a link are the major news organizations such as CNN, ABC news, MSNBC, etc.

		5.   The Contractor shall include in the webcast webpage an option for webcast viewers to voluntarily respond to the NRC's "viewer survey".  The Contractor shall collect the data from each response and provide it to the NRC/PO within 10 days after the end of each calendar-month.  The NRC reserves the right to determine what information is to be collected by the survey.  The current   survey provides the viewer an opportunity to express their level of interest in both "live" and "archived" meeting webcasts, and also lists various "viewer affiliation categories" that the viewer can select to identify their affiliation including:
		 A. Categories of viewer affiliation (such as licensee, utility, general public,
		     media, NRC staffer, federal/state/local official, public interest group, 
		     industry, international).
		 B. Level of viewer interest in having "live" NRC meetings available for Internet
		     access (categorized by very interested, interested, slightly interested, and 
		     no interest). 
		 C. Level of viewer interest in having "archived" NRC meetings available for
		     Internet access (categorized by very interested, interested, slightly 
		     interested, and no interest). 

		6.  The Contractor shall include in the webcast webpage an option for webcast viewers to submit  comments/questions on the NRC webcasting program.  The Contractor shall forward each viewer comment/question to the NRC at STREAMING@NRC.GOV, within 24-hours of its receipt. 

		7.  The Contractor shall ensure the webcast webpage never contains "inappropriate language or references" (offensive or intentionally misleading).

		8.  To establish the initial list of "archived" webcasts on the Contractor ?s new webcast webpage, the NRC-PO will provide the Contractor those previously archived webcasts that are still of interest to viewers and the Contractor shall add the previous NRC webcasts to the Contractor ?s new webcast webpage (provided to the Contractor by the NRC-PO in CD-Rom format from the list of archived webcasts on the NRC's current webcast webpage supported by NIH).

		9.  The webcast webpage shall only include the information provided by NRC.

		10. The webcast webpage shall be "fully operational" during all "live" webcasts and shall be fully operational at least 23-hours out of each 24-hours in a calendar-day during periods when "live" webcasts are not being webcast. 

Date of Delivery:      Within 30-days of the date of contract award. 

Task-2.a.  NRC Measure:	The Contractor shall provide a webcast webpage that meets all of the NRC's requirements within the specified delivery time.
Task-2.a.  NRC Standard:	The webpage complies with all NRC requirements. 
Task-2.a.  NRC Quality 
	        Assurance:	Initially, the NRC-PO will inspect the webcast webpage upon notification by the Contractor of its completion, including inspecting the addition of the previous NRC webcasts that establishes the current "archived" webcast availability list.    During the contract period, the NRC-PO will inspect the webcast webpage prior to each "live" webcast and also after each webcast is added as an "archived" webcast.   Further, the NRC-PO will investigate any complaint received from viewers that the webpage is not "fully operational".

Guidance:	Upon award of the contract, NRC will provide the Contractor with a CD-ROM version of the previous NRC webcasts that NRC determines are still of interest to viewers and the Contractor shall add these previous webcasts to the new webcast webpage (approximately 30 3-hour webcasts).  NRC requires webcasts to remain available as an archived version until NRC is satisfied they have served their intended purpose (usually for 12-months after the "live" webcast of the meeting or the date the webcast was added to the webcast website, whichever was later).

Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 6.  The above numbered combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to respond to vendor questions.  Accordingly, ADM-03-161 is amended as follows:

(1)  Following are responses to questions: 

QUESTION #1:	You mentioned "scrambled" signal from NRC to contractor's site.  I assume this would be required if we were to take the feed by fiber to our facility and then webcast.  But, would we be able to install our webcasting computer in the rack at NRC, encode the signal there (hands off, remotely),and send it to our distribution network?  Would this strategy eliminate the need to scramble?
RESPONSE #1:	Refer to Task-3 in the SOW which states: "The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage."
			Please propose solutions that meet these requirements.


QUESTION #2:	Will any titles or captions, other than the captioning mentioned, be required?
RESPONSE #2: 	The webcast vendor will not be required to perform any captioning.  NRC will obtain the services to caption the meeting's discussions in real-time and NRC will then add the captions to the single composite video feed, prior to delivering the feed to the webcast vendor.  Refer to Task-3 in the SOW which states: "For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text)." 


QUESTION #3:	Your AV technician indicated that the archival video version would not require captioning.  Will tapes sent to contractor require captioning?  If so, will the captioning signal be part of the video or will contractor have to add?
RESPONSE #3:		Refer to the response to the previous question (#2).  The webcast vendor will not be required to perform any captioning.  NRC will add captioning to the composite video feed of "Live" webcasts, prior to delivering it to the webcast vendor.  If any captioning is desired by NRC for a taped meeting, NRC will add it to the video on the tape, before providing the tape to the webcast vendor.  

QUESTION #4:	Your specifications in the synopsis mentioned " equivalent quality of video image as the RealNetworks software".  Is RealNetworks software a requirement, or can we utilize Windows Media software which is considered by industry experts to be the equal to Real Networks in quality?  Should we offer a choice, or option, in our pricing proposal?
RESPONSE #4: 	We have decided to modify the current SOW under Task-1, requirement #4 which states: 
			"4. Provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the equivalent software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website." 
			This current language for #4 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following new language:
			"4.  Provide all webcast viewers with the capability of choosing to view NRC webcasts in two (2) software formats, one of which shall be RealNetworks.  The second media player software format is up to the webcast vendor, but both software formats shall comply with all of the SOW requirements.  For both software formats, the contractor shall provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the webcast viewing software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website. At all times, the webcast vendor shall support at least 100 concurrent viewers in any combination of users between the two software formats of media players."  


QUESTION #5:	"Will NRC provide the Fiber connection from the control booth to the cabling location on the P-1 level"? Or; "Is this Fiber connection to be provided by the contractor"?
RESPONSE #5:	NRC has already established a dedicated line connection between the audiovisual control booth (room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room) and the P1-11 telephone equipment room.   The webcast contractor shall be responsible for providing a dedicated line which can connect to this established NRC line at the P1-11 telephone room location and transport the NRC webcast signal from the P1-11 telephone room to the webcast vendor's offsite webcast infrastructure.  Webcast vendors are hereby advised that the established NRC dedicated line between the NRC Hearing Room's adjacent control booth and the P1-11 telephone equipment room is not a fiber connection.  Instead, it is an RG-6 coaxial cable with an F-type connector suitable for transporting a composite signal riding on RF on it (an RF signal).  (NOTE: You could currently attach this coax cable to the "cable-in" or "TV aerial-in jack" of a normal cable-ready TV and watch the NRC's composite signal of the Commission meeting to be webcast).  Additional NRC clarifications of the technical terms used herein are provided below:
			Composite: This signal has all the colour, brightness and synchronization information mixed together and sent on one wire.   In A/V gear you often see a yellow RCA jack (along with a red and white RCA jack).   The yellow is for the composite signal, and the red and white are for stereo sound.
			RF: Take a composite signal and then use it to modulate an RF signal and you get RF. This is what is received on a TV aerial.  RF is usually carried over RG-6 coax cable with F-type connectors.  In Montgomery county, this is what the cable guy hooks into your TV set.
			Additionally, webcast vendors are hereby advised that NRC will provide the webcast vendor with sufficient rack-space in the control booth room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room (instead of the P1-11 telephone room) for the vendor to install the on-site equipment required to encode the NRC webcast composite signal and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure.  
			To clarify this contract requirement, NRC hereby modifies the SOW to delete the following current language in Section VII NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT of the SOW in its entirety "The NRC will provide the contractor onsite access for initial installation setup and shall provide limited space and power connection for the contractor's equipment.  The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities."
	
			NRC hereby provides the following new language for Section VII NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT "The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  NRC will provide the webcast vendor with sufficient power and rack-space in the control booth room (which is adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room), for the vendor to install the necessary on-site equipment to encode the NRC webcast composite signal and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure.  NRC will provide a dedicated line (an RG-6 coaxial cable with an F-type connector suitable for transporting a composite signal riding on RF on it "an RF signal") between the control booth room and the P1-11 telephone room, for use by the webcast contractor to transmit the encoded webcast signal to the P1-11 telephone room location.  At the P1-11 room location, the webcast vendor shall provide the dedicated line necessary to transmit the encoded webcast signal to the vendor's offsite webcast infrastructure.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.  The on-site assistance NRC will provide the webcast vendor for NRC "test" or "Live" webcasts is limited to ensuring the vendor's equipment is "turned-on" prior to a webcast and ensuring it is "turned-off" after conclusion of each webcast, if the vendor requests such assistance."   
	
			GUIDANCE: NRC has decided to have the webcast vendor install the necessary on-site webcasting equipment in the control booth room (adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room) instead of the P1-11 telephone room (as discussed during the on-site walk-thru held on March 13th, 2003) in order to simplify providing the vendor with periodic access to the equipment when necessary, and to enable NRC to easily assist the vendor with the task of ensuring the equipment is "turned-on" before a "Live" webcast and "turned-off" upon the webcast's conclusion.   NRC will not make any other adjustments to the vendor's equipment.
     
QUESTION #6:	"Can you provide an estimate, based on your current system, of the number of total and/or concurrent viewers of the "On Demand" archived sessions"?
RESPONSE #6: 	Refer to the SOW under Task-1, requirement #3 which states: "3. Have capacity to support up to one-hundred (100) concurrent webcast viewers at 150kbps".


QUESTION #7:	Dedicated fiber - What are your preferred vendors for telecom support for that building that supply fiber?
 RESPONSE #7:	We have no preferred vendor.


QUESTION #8:	Is a dedicated fiber line to our server a requirement or would a dedicated T1 or a VPN or some other less expensive secure mechanism also be acceptable?
RESPONSE #8:	Only a dedicated line is a requirement.   A dedicated "fiber" line is not a requirement.  Use of any existing NRC IT network to meet this requirement is prohibited.



QUESTION #9:	Is there an existing example security plan that you could make available to us for review prior to the proposal submittal date?
 RESPONSE #9:	No.


QUESTION #10:	Do you have a preference where our streaming servers might be physically located within the US?
 RESPONSE #10:	No.


QUESTION #11:	Is the webcast video (Eg. meeting & captions) going to be different then what you want archived (Eg. meeting only) ?
 RESPONSE #11:	No.  The NRC's composite signal for the "Live" webcast (which contains the audio, video and closed-captioning) is the same content that NRC wants the viewers to be able to access in the archived version.  The one difference between the "Live" webcast and its archived version is the length of the webcast because NRC does not want the webcast vendor to include the video of the pre-meeting testing (conducted prior to each "Live" webcast) in the archived version of each webcast.    


QUESTION #12:	Are both the webcast and the archives to be made available at all 3 bandwidths or just the webcast?
 RESPONSE #12:	Both "Live" and "archived" webcasts shall be made available in any combination of all 3 bandwidths.


QUESTION #13:	Would the NRC be responsible for a power up mechanism for the encoder box from the control room or would we?
 RESPONSE #13:	Refer to the response for QUESTION #5 which solves this issue.


QUESTION #14:	What is the existing fiber on P1 used for?
RESPONSE #14: 	Other functions, un-related to webcasting.


QUESTION #15:	Can it be used to transmit the composite video for remote encoding?
 RESPONSE #15: 	No.  It is the contractors responsibility to provide a dedicated line from the NRC room P1-11 telephone room to their offsite webcasting facility.  NRC will not allow the use of existing NRC lines between the P1-11 room and the contractor's location. 


QUESTION #16:	If yes, what bandwidth is available on the fiber?
RESPONSE #16:	See the previous response to Question #15.

QUESTION #17:	Does NRC have a preferred or current vendor for fiber connectivity out of the building?
 RESPONSE #17:	We have no preferred vendor.

QUESTION #18:	Does NRC prefer encoding to take place on or off-site?
RESPONSE #18:	Refer to Task-3 which states this requirement as follows: "For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text).   The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage. "

QUESTION #19:	Does NRC have a preferred vendor for network connectivity?
 RESPONSE #19:	No preferred vendor.

QUESTION #20:	Is NRC providing the composite video feed from the control room to the P1 level network room (room P1-11)?
 RESPONSE #20:	Yes, see the response to question #5.


QUESTION #21:	Is NRC providing a rack and rack space on the P1 level?
RESPONSE #21:	Yes, NRC will provide a rack and rack-space on-site to accommodate the equipment required to encode and transmit the webcast signal from NRC to the contractor's webcast infrastructure.  However, the rack and rack-space will be in the control booth room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room where the NRC meetings that are to be webcast are held.  Refer to the response for Question #5. 


QUESTION #22:	Live viewer history. Can you tell us how many viewers you have had in the past per live webcast? 
RESPONSE #22:	Vendors should plan on supporting at least 100 concurrent viewers during each "Live" webcast.

QUESTION #23: 	Connection Rates.  Can you supply us with a breakout of the speed those viewers connected at?  How many at 28.8k, 56k and 150k?
RESPONSE #23:	The breakout of viewer connection rates will change with every webcast based on who is interested in the topic of the NRC meeting being webcast.  Vendors should refer to the SOW for the specified webcast system capacities required by NRC.


QUESTION #24:	Do you currently have a dedicated T1 line or higher to supply us for the broadcast?
RESPONSE #24:	No.

QUESTION #25:	Do you want us to host the webpage for you on one of our servers or just develop it for you?
RESPONSE #25:	Refer to Task-2 in the the SOW which states "Requirement: Develop and host a webpage.  The  webpage shall be the host site for NRC webcast viewers to gain access to "live" and/or "archived" webcasts of NRC meetings via the Internet during the contract period.  To ensure compatibility and a consistent appearance and functionality of the Contractor ‘s webcast webpage with NRC's other webpages, the Contractor shall use the current webcast webpage developed by NIH as the model for developing the new webcast webpage. (Visit www.nrc.gov. and click on "Live NRC Meeting Webcast and Webcast Archive.") " 
QUESTION #26:	In reading all of the modifications that have been posted lately, we noticedthat modification #6 (which was intended to correct a problem with CLINS 16-19) has a problem.  These units now have a question mark in front of the hour designation.  I am assuming that you still want these units priced in half-hour intervals but I thought I'd give you a heads up about it.  It may present itself as a problem later on and I wanted to point it out in case it was important.


RESPONSE #26:    The unit of measure for CLINs 0016, 0017, 0018, and 0019 is  one-half hour.
(2)   FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER. 

(3)  Nothing follows.

<DESC>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, competition for this procurement is restricted to the United States and  Canada.  Because of the Government's extensive prior development efforts in the  field of high energy pulsed power supply technology, the Government has decided  to release a Pulsed Power Supply (PPS) Technology Summary, to interested  Offerors, as soon as this solicitation is released.  Due to the restriction on  competition for this effort and the fact that Electromagnetic Gun (EM)  technology has been identified as a developing military critical technology,  all contractors that desire the Government's information package are required  to submit an approved DD Form 2345, "Military Critical Technical Data  Agreement" with their request for this information.  After receipt of the DD  Form 2345, a nondisclosure agreement will be sent to the contractor for  signature.  This may be signed and faxed to the Government.  Upon receipt, the  Government will mail a copy of the PPS information.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) is currently seeking sources for the assembly and manufacture of the FMU-139 C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze.    The FMU-139C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze is an electromechanical fuze that provides safing; in-flight cockpit setting capability, with multiple arming and multiple function delay selections; and moderate penetration capability.  The fuze contains an explosive train, which is mechanically and electrically out-of-line until specific weapon launch cycle events have occurred.  Once a valid launch has occurred, the fuze will arm in the selected arm time.  The fuze provides arm times selected either by the pulsed power/Fuze Function Control Set (FFCS), or when continuous power/turbine powered, by ground selection.  The FMU-139C/B can also be used with a separate proximity sensor.  The fuze can be initiated by either an external proximity sensor or impact.  A closure ring secures the fuze in the fuze well of warheads.  Prior to operational use it may be stored, transported worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes." It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection. SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather. SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees. SDO will have a mission life of 5 years.	NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the Propellant Tanks for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project. The present requirements are specified in the attached documents:  Exhibit 1 - Propellant Tank SOW 464-PROP-LEGL-0019 Exhibit 2 - Propellant Tank Specification 464-PROP-SPEC-0017 This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work and Specification via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities. NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-AAAAA
<RESPDATE>032404
<ARCHDATE>04082004
<CONTACT>Aaron Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-344-1404, Fax 202-344-1254, Email aaron.h.ford@customs.treas.gov - Aaron Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-344-1404, Fax 202-344-1254, Email aaron.h.ford@customs.treas.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has an immediate need for new technology, commercial off the shelf (COTS) License Plate Reader/Vehicle Counter System(s) to be installed and maintained to reflect additional CBP border crossing requirements.  BACKGROUND: Customs and Border Protection (CBP) initiated a program that successfully developed, deployed and maintained License Plate Reader (LPR) and Vehicle Counter Systems (VCS). The LPR system automatically locates, reads and communicates the license plate information to the CBP Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS). TECS then automatically queries its database for law enforcement information associated with the license plate and its registered owner and then provides the inspector with the response information.  This system eliminates inspectors from having to manually enter license plate information into TECS at operating terminals located at each Port of Entry primary inspection station.  This process is time consuming, subject to error and requires that the inspector lose eye contact with the approaching vehicle and its occupants, thereby precluding the possibility to optimize inspection. The Vehicle Counter System (VCS) utilizes the License Plate Reader (LPR) equipment to count the number of vehicles passing through each lane as they enter the United States. The information is computerized for tabulation purposes/management reporting on the number of vehicles crossing the borders per day, per lane, in half-hour increments and is able to maintain a one-year tabulation on a rotating monthly basis.  Currently, both the License Plate Reader and Vehicle Counter Systems are installed and maintained at inbound primary inspection lanes and some outbound traffic lanes at the Northern and Southern Border Ports of Entry.  REQUIREMENTS: License Plate Reader - The License Plate Reader when installed, shall automatically locate, read, process and communicate the license plate data to the Treasury Enforcement Communications System.  CBP requires the LPR system to locate the license plate(s), correctly read both the alphanumeric characters and the state or province of origin, sending the resulting license plate information (alphanumeric/province of origin) to TECS on at least 95% of all passenger vehicles which have at least one (1) license plate that is unobstructed, undamaged, and is in the field of view of the LPR system, as the vehicle passes through the lane.   When the LPR system is deployed, it shall interface with TECS and be capable of recording, saving and retrieving license plate images as required.  Vehicle Counter - The Vehicle Counter system shall be able to correctly count the number of passenger vehicles, which pass through a lane with at least 99% accuracy.  This system shall be capable of tabulating and generating reports, for management purposes, on the number of vehicles crossing the borders per day, per lane, in half-hour increments.   It shall also be capable of maintaining twelve (12) months of historical data, while saving data from the current month.  All data must be saved to a portable media.  CBP requires that the VC system be integrated within the LPR system.  Security – Some employees associated with the installation of CBP License Plate Reader and Vehicle Counter equipment may be exposed to law enforcement data and may require a Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection background investigation.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor's information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  Firms who wish to respond to this RFI shall provide a technical proposal/approach and a cost estimate to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at Aaron.H.Ford@dhs.gov.  The cost estimate is for budgetary/planning purposes.  Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should also include their business size, CAGE Code, Dun & Bradstreet number, GSA Schedule, should they possess one.  Interested persons should contact Aaron H. Ford, Contracting Officer, Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20229, (202) 344-1404.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.
	
This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to Pediatric Inpatient Drug Utilization Data.  A one-year base contract with two, 1-year options is contemplated.  The major objectives to be accomplished under this contract are to provide FDA with: 1) Immediate automated access to a currently existing, pediatric inpatient data resource with the capability of providing counts of discharges and/or patients utilizing drugs in children’s hospitals, and characterizing the hospitalization episode; 2) Direct, unlimited access to data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and 3) The ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.  The data resource shall contain information from a minimum of 25 pediatric hospitals, and must be commercially available as of July 1, 2004.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to provide the data as well as the means to access the data.  For purposes of this synopsis a pediatric hospital is defined as an institution which is organized and operated for the care of individuals who are usually less than 18 years of age, and who are being treated for conditions that normally require a stay of 30 days or less.  The data provided shall meet the need of the FDA to access discharge-level and/or patient-level data describing pediatric inpatient drug use in children’s hospitals.  The size and characteristics of the population of hospitals from which the data are derived shall be provided to the FDA.  Characterizing of the sample shall minimally include: number of hospitals, size of hospitals, geographic diversity of hospitals, number of discharges per year, demographic distribution of discharges in the sample, types of hospitals and a description of specialty units within sample hospitals. Also, if available, the FDA would like to know the number of unique patients hospitalized per year in the sample and their demographic distribution. The FDA has no interest in knowing the identity of any patient, provider, or hospital included in the data resource.  It shall be solely the Contractor’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  In addition, the following information shall be provided: 1) the number of years of valid data available overall and in real time; 2) the ability and ease of accessing data that is no longer on-line; 3) the lag time between the date of service for the hospitalization and on-line availability of the data; and 4) data collection and management procedures.  These characteristics are essential for determining whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available.  The inpatient data shall be amenable to analysis at the discharge-level and/or patient-level.  Age and gender of the patient at hospitalization shall be required.   Hospitalization episode data shall be required, and shall include the dates of hospitalization, the length of stay, all diagnoses related to the hospitalization, all procedures, and discharge disposition. Data related to drug prescriptions in hospital shall be required for all drugs administered during the hospitalization episode, and shall include the generic and established name for the drug, strength, and dosage form.  A complete data dictionary shall also be included.
Also, if available, the FDA would like to know information on race/ethnicity of hospitalized patients, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  The FDA would additionally like the following information relating to the hospitalization episode, if available: operating room and radiology procedure and drug data (anesthetics, contrast agents, etc.), microbiology data (cultures, sensitivities, antigen testing, etc.), information on admitting diagnosis, drugs at admission, and drugs at discharge.  The FDA would like the following drug-related information, if available, for all administered drugs: date administered, treatment dose, and treatment duration.

As part of the evaluation process offerors shall provide a seven-day trail subscription and technical documentation for four individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purpose of evaluation.  During the trial subscription period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purpose of evaluation of the data resource.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages, in Microsoft Word, no later than March 26, 2004 to the Contract Specialist via email at kminker@oc.fda.gov

Note: Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number D84002.

Request for copies of the RFP or other documents relating to this requirement will not be addressed.   No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until AFTER the RFP has been released.  Any questions received (via any medium including E-mail, Mail, Phone or Fax) before the RFP is released will be deleted/not addressed.   There is no additional information available at this time about this requirement.

<SUBJECT>B -- Quntitative Benefit-Cost Analyses for NIST Advance Technology Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SS-2004-01

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking sources with the capabilities to perform in-depth quantitative benefit-cost analyses of individual technology development projects and aggregates of projects funded by the Advanced Technology Program since its inception in 1990. *** Quantitative benefit-cost case studies are a foundation of ATP assessment of project outcomes and impacts in the longer term.  They have become instrumental in NIST-level budget documents and financial reporting as well as ATP reports to various stakeholders.  OMB, in particular, expects to see return on investment results, and has increased its expectations for “retrospective” analyses of benefits actually realized by the program to date, as compared with “prospective” analyses, as time has passed.  The utility of these studies depends on consistency and clarity of analysis and on the communication and presentation of complex concepts and results to a lay audience. *** Addressing the multi-faceted mission of the Advanced Technology Program “to accelerate the development of innovative technologies of broad public benefit undertaken through partnerships with the private sector”, studies will identify and quantify technical accomplishments, quantify private and public benefits and costs, and identify broader, less quantifiable impacts on industrial innovation and societal impact.   State-of-the art analysis techniques are expected to include traditional cash flow analysis directed at private and social rate of return measures and/or other approaches such as macroeconomic modeling, simulation, or econometrics, as appropriate.  Emphasis will be on ATP projects where the period of ATP funding has ended and commercialization has begun. *** Some task orders are anticipated to require a team approach, or a network of experts, encompassing specifically, scientist, economist, and/or financial market expertise.  Others may emphasize development of training modules or convening of workshops to explore issues in benefit-cost analysis techniques applied to early stage technology development projects undertaken by industry with private-public funding. *** Examples of studies currently being considered (not exhaustive) include the following: *** (1) Case studies of a single project, a cluster of similar technologies or applications, or a group of projects under an ATP focused program.  Studies will involve quantitative analysis of benefits and costs from product or process technologies.  Such studies will emphasize projects where the ATP-funded technology development phase is complete, and commercialization has begun.  (2) Case studies of complex projects, such as large joint ventures or groups of related projects involving substantial technology diffusion and potentially impacting multiple industries or multiple segments of a given industry.  Some of these studies are expected to require methodology development for tracing impacts in unanticipated applications and industries and to involve complex ATP attribution issues.  (3) Projects involving modeling of globalization of technology and trade.  Studies are expected to require modeling of economic benefits to U.S. consumers from ATP-funded technologies commercialized abroad.  (4) Workshops devoted to theoretical and practical issues in performing benefit-cost analysis; for example: appropriate use of private v. public v. social measures of return; confidentiality of company information; handling the counterfactual and program attributions; and definition of measures and/or new approaches; and possibilities for use of control groups. *** It is estimated that 1-2 task orders, amounting to $200,000–400,000 will be issued per year, beginning in FY 04. *** Information furnished must not exceed 10 pages and should include background information, contracts both Government and commercial for similar services, and references; i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organization’s capability for ATP to perform a proper evaluation of the capability statement. *** Interested parties shall provide the Government with information as follows: (1) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Company Size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), or Hubzone Small Business); (4) Identify whether you are interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; (5) Identify whether the services identified in the Draft Statement of  Work are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (6) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (7) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based - include the contract number; Government agency name and address; contract funded amount; (8) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; and (9) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel. *** THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. *** Firms interested in performing this requirement may reply to this Sources Sought by addressing the elements above and any processes that would be used.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to Abacus Technology Corporation for maintenance and consulting support for its Telecommunication Automated Tracking System (TATS).  The contractor will provide the Department of Education with maintenance and consulting services, including assisting ED staff with Telecommunications Ordering, Reporting and Inventory System (TORIS) configurations, specifications, code, functionality and general assistance inquiries for a base period of 10 months with 2 option periods of one year each.  A sole-source procurement is requested because of the proprietary nature of the application Abacus Technology developed which cannot be obtained from a competitive procurement.  Additionally, three other agencies (U.S. Courts, VA and Secret Service) have acquired and developed their own version of TORIS.  Abacus Technology Corporation provides maintenance for these applications and periodically makes code changes to enhance system functionality (at no cost to the government).  The Department would like to keep Abacus Technology Corporation on in a consulting capacity to keep the application at the same level as the other agencies and take advantage of the ongoing technology.  This is not a request for proposals.  However, all interested parties should submit a letter of interest to the contact person by the closing date in the notice.  If any another sources are interested, the Department will post an amendment to this notice seeking capability statements from interested parties.  If any other capable, responsible sources are found, this procurement will be opened for full and open competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) announces the intent to enter into sole source negotiations and award of a follow-on delivery order to Workforce Technologies, Inc., 451A Carlisle Drive, Herndon, VA 20170 for maintenance and technical support of a Resume Builder.  The DISA Manpower, Personnel, and Security (MPS) Directorate uses the proprietary technology of the Resume Builder product of WorkForce Technologies as a vital component of the automated resume intake and processing toolset used by the entire agency.  This product was originally procured as the only one of its type and has been extensively customized over the years specifically for DISA’s use.

This acquisition is for maintenance support for Resumix software.  The period of performance will be for twelve months with an option to renew for an additional two periods of six months.  It is the Government’s intent to make award utilizing GSA Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.  It has been determined that a sole source award to Workforce Technologies for continued services is in the best interest of the Government and would best satisfy the Agency’s needs.  This determination of the Government was made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(4) and is solely at the discretion of the Government.  There is NO solicitation document.

<SUBJECT>R -- Contract ceiling increases
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce that the contract ceiling on four multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts awarded on 11 September 2001 for National Communication System (NCS) Scientific Integration and Technical Assistance (SETA) will be increased by $108M from $64.5M to $172.5M.  These contracts contain a base period and four option periods.  Final expiration date of the last option period is 30 September 2006.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to unanticipated requirements in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11).  These requirements were not contemplated or included in the original ceiling of $64.5M, however, the work performed was within the scope of these contracts.  As a result of the requirements placed against these contracts as a result of the events of 9/11, the contract ceiling of $64.5M is expected to be reached by the end of March 2004.  An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued  scientific engineering and technical assistance support services for various projects for the NCS and Department of Homeland Security. The increase will ensure that sufficient contract ceiling is available for new tasks expected in support of the DHS.  The ceiling applies to all contracts and is not divided up in any away between the four contracts.  A competitive follow-on acquisition is planned to replace these contracts when they expire on 30 September 2006.  All task orders processed under the NCS SETA contracts are and will continue to be competed using fair opportunity procedures among the four NCS SETA contractors unless a fair opportunity exception in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies.  The four NCS SETA contractors and numbers are:  Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Inc. (BAH) – DCA100-01-D-4001, Sytex, Inc. – DCA100-01-D-4002, Arrowhead Gobal Solutions, Inc. – DCA100-01-D-4003, and Communications Technologies, Inc. – DCA100-01-D-4004.  See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Metals Affordability Initiative
<DESC>Introduction: Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate (AFRL/ML), reannounces the award of the Core Metals Affordability Initiative (“Core MAI”), Agreement Number F33615-99-2-5215. This Initiative is a joint effort of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Materials and Manufacturing Directorate and a Consortium made up of raw material producers, component suppliers, designers, assemblers, and original equipment manufacturers, currently: The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Brush-Wellman, Carpenter Technology Corporation, Dynamet, Honeywell Incorporated, Ladish Co. Inc., Howmet Corporation, ALLVAC, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, PCC Structurals Inc., Rolls-Royce Allison, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Special Metals Corporation, Titanium Metals Corporation, and Pratt & Whitney. 

Presently Pratt & Whitney is the fiduciary agent or lead company (“Recipient”) for the Consortium and staffs a Program Office to support the Consortium.  It is noted that as a Cooperative Agreement this Award is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (“FAR”). The Cooperative Agreement and its attached documents, and the Collaboration Agreement included all documents and procedures referenced herein may be obtained by contacting the MAI Program Office (Not from the POC listed above.) (Please see all the corresponding names, postal and electronic addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers as set forth in the documents that have been made available electronically at the addresses indicated herein.) 

The Core MAI Initiative is structured to facilitate the conduct of projects based upon the submittal and selection of White Papers setting forth projects that will further the goals stated herein.  The Materials Affordability Initiative Consortium (MAIC), in conjunction with AFRL/ML, is interested in receiving proposals (“White Papers”) on the technical efforts (“Projects”) described below. White Papers in response to this announcement shall be sent to the MAI Program Office at Pratt & Whitney (See Section F of this document for the Points of Contact and corresponding addresses) for receipt on or before 1500 Hours local (East Hartford) time 45 calendar days from the date of this announcement, if the offeror wishes to have his/her White Paper considered for funding at the expected Technical Oversight Committee (“TOC”) meeting to be held on or before May 5th 2004. Offerors, who wish to submit White Papers later than 45 calendar days from the date of this announcement, can do so, 4 (four) months prior to the proposed start date of the project (with no end date of a project proposed to go past the completion date of the Core MAI Cooperative Agreement which is currently September 30, 2007).  However, because of uncertainty of funding approval cycles it is not known when the TOC committee will again meet to review and evaluate White Papers.  

No other solicitation is anticipated in regard to this requirement; but you are advised to monitor the Wright Research Site Contracting Office Web Site: http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/.
You are further advised to continue to monitor the CBD and FedBizOpps (Federal Business Opportunities Web Site (http://www.eps.gov/) for adjustments and updates, including possible changes in the performance period for which White Papers Projects may apply.

Potential submitters are put on notice that if an offeror is not a consortium member at the time its White Paper is submitted, it must be designated by the Air Force as a consortium member in accordance with the Government's established and objective criteria and procedures and must sign the Collaboration Agreement between the consortium members, or team with a Consortium Member before its White Paper may be evaluated for funding in accordance with the process described in the Proposal Evaluation Process (PEP) document.  New consortium members will participate with existing consortium members on the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") in the evaluation and scoring of White Papers as described in the PEP.  All White Papers received in response to the solicitation will be submitted to the MAI Program Office which, in turn (and, if the offeror is not currently a member of the Consortium, after (1) notification by the Air Force that the offeror has been admitted as a new Consortium Member under the relevant objective criteria and (2) the offeror has signed the Collaboration agreement), will forward copies to each member of the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") at least three (3) weeks prior to the collective TOC evaluation .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and proposals are being requested. The U.S. Department of State is seeking services to conduct an initial screening for expediting the overall system of the Special Agents candidate examination as stated in the following Statement of Work: AUTOMATED SPECIAL AGENT SELECTION PROCESS.  Background:  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) recruits and hires Special Agents based upon their suitability for the job.  Approximately 10% of all applicants are immediately eliminated due to failure to meet minimum qualifications.  The remainders are tested in a process that culminates in each candidate being interviewed and examined in person.  Candidates who are successful are then placed on a rank-ordered list that is used to fill future vacancies.  DS needs to reduce the time and resources expended in this screening and initial testing process in order to more effectively focus attention on the personal interview/testing portions. Improved preliminary methodology is considered imperative in meeting increased demands for additional Special Agent resources.  An automated selection process to provide the methodology for conducting an initial screening is hereby recommended as the most feasible solution for expediting the overall system of Special Agent candidate examination. The resulting improvement would enable DS Recruiters to devote time to reviewing only the most qualified candidates who successfully complete the preliminary screening/testing. Objective: The objective of the program is to streamline the application and recruitment process to ensure that only the highest caliber applicants are offered appointments to be tested for the DS Special Agent position. The goal will be achieved by implementing an on-line examination/assessment process designed to identify only the best-qualified candidates for further consideration. The priority for implementation of this process is immediate. It is anticipated that the requirement is for a minimum of five years. Pilot Phase Online Examination Development: The offeror shall insure that the vital components of the Department’s assessment criteria are addressed.  These are referred to as the “KSAP’s” - Knowledge, Skills, Aptitude and Personal Characteristics. The examination shall be designed to minimize test-taker lethargy.  The examination is subject to DS and HR prior-approval and shall be sufficiently flexible to enable changes as deemed appropriate. Pilot Phase Deliverables and Schedule: (1) Draft Examination/Assessment Methodology Report, proposed 60-75 multiple-choice question examination in computer software format (e.g., Microsoft Word, Notepad).

(5) Program Review: Approximately 165 days after contract award. (6) Upon completion of Pilot Program (to run simultaneously with April 2004, Special Agent Vacancy Announcement), deliver results of online screening to DS.  This will serve to validate the process. Online Examination Operations and Support: The offeror shall provide online examination operations and support. DS will identify any changes, enhancement, or updates to the online examination as required to support this program.  The offeror shall support the online testing of DS Special Agent applicants using its own website resources and shall provide suitable documentation to DS containing the test results of each applicant who took the online examination.  The offeror shall monitor their website to maintain a high level of user availability.  Additionally, the offeror shall monitor the entire online examination process to verify the accuracy and integrity of test results produced by the online examination.

CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  

Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 

The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.
