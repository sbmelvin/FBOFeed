Box 1300, Attleboro Falls, MA 02763-0300, for 500 each, National Wildlife Refuge Service (NWRS) Law Enforcement Badges embedded into Lucite Mold with blue background and gold plate inside Lucite with engravable plate with letters, and 120 each, National Wildlife Refuge System logo, NWRS Centennial Badges, and NWRS Badge embedded with engraved gold plate inside Lucite.  The Service conducted a market research for different types of metals and finishes for badges to determine the desired product for the Service's law enforcement badges and found that only Backinton & Co. can provide the badges because they must match current National Wildlife Refuge System's badges which are made of a finished material that is a registered trademark of Blackinton.  It is critical that the same finish be applied when the badges are cleaned and refinished prior to placing them in Lucite.  Due to the fact that this is a Blackinton product, the process needs to be completed by Blackinton.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Please send inquiries preferably via email to Eric McDoniel at Eric_McDoniel@fws.gov.  No telephone inquiries, please.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for services.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ) # BLS-04-19 in accordance to FAR Part 13, NTE $35,000.00.  

DESCRIPTION:  

Background:  

Currently the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes data based on an integration of data from two different sources, an Interview and a Diary survey, which comprise the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Surveys. Data from each survey are used in the publication of expenditures, but microdata analysis of expenditures often relies on using only one of the surveys.  For both tabular publication and microdata use, two major concerns with the CE Interview and Diary data are the differences in the means and differences in the variances of expenditures for the same items collected in both components.  

The BLS is initiating a research project to examine the differences in the expenditure data collected in both the Interview and Diary.  For this research, the BLS is seeking a contractor who can build on earlier research to examine differences in both the mean and distribution of similar categories in the Interview and Diary, and then provide guidance regarding the possible use of components of both surveys to measure total expenditures for publication and for use in the microdata.  

Scope of Work:  

The goals of this research are to use both Interview and Diary data to identify the major sources of bias in the measurement of expenditure means and variances (and other moments) for integrated survey estimates, and to provide recommendations for the best use of both surveys in economic analyses using the microdata.  

The contractor, in consultation with BLS, will conduct the following:  

•	Calculate (levels of and trends in) the variances and covariances of a measure of non-durable expenditures and its components.  
•	Using interview quality data (e.g., length of interview, use of receipts, recall period, frequency of purchase, etc.) for both surveys, identify the measurement error in each survey by sub-category, estimate the relative sizes of each type of error, and determine whether particular measures of quality can be used in reducing these measurement errors.  
•	Determine whether there are any demographic differences between respondents of the Interview and Diary surveys, and if so the impact they have on their reported expenditures.  

ARTICLE I BLS INPUT:  

BLS will provide the contractor, if needed, any current BLS publications including
relevant research, reports, data documentation, and, if needed, additional non-confidential data and/or tabulations of data.

<SUBJECT>99--Solicitation for concession contract to provide marina services in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area
<SOLNBR>CCBICA00704
<ARCHDATE>04272005
<CONTACT>Judy Jennings Chief, Concessions Management 3039692661     ;
<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a prospectus to solicit proposals for a concession contract to provide marina services for the general public at Ok-A-Beh Marina in the North Unit of Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, Montana.  The prospectus will be issued for a 30-day response period.  Proposals for this prospectus must be received by the close of business (no later than 4:00 p.m.) 30 days after the posted date of this notice.  The concession contract authorizes the operation of the Ok-A-Beh Marina including boat gasoline and oil sales; boat rentals; boat slip rentals; sale of limited boat accessories, fishing and camping supplies, souvenirs, grocery items, prepackaged food products, and non-alcoholic beverages; limited fast food and beverage service; and tour boat service.  Marina services are provided a minimum from 12:00 p.m. (noon) to 6:00 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays and 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays from June 18 to September 12, 2004.  The concession may be open longer hours and more days in 2005 and 2006 upon approval from the superintendent.  Government owned facilities are assigned for concessioner's use.  The Director has determined that no preferred offeror for this contract exists pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51.  The concession permit expired December 31, 2003.  The length of the new contract will be for three (3) years.  The annual gross receipts from 1997 through 2001 averaged $115,061.  Annual gross receipts decreased to $20,398 during 2002.  The concession was open 10 days in 2002 due to low lake level and closure of the Ok-A-Beh boat ramp.  In 2002 and 2003 drought conditions reduced visitation to the park, the number of boats launched at Ok-A-Beh boat ramp, and days of concession operation.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $35 if the prospectus is to be shipped via Federal Express.  Please provide a telephone number, including area code, and physical address (no Post Office Box numbers). The printing cost recovery charge is $30 if the prospectus is picked up.

NOTE:  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>This procurement is in support of the Joint Program Management Office-Individual Protection Alternate Footwear Solution (AFS) project.  The AFS project is a subset of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) program.  Its goal is to acquire a chemical/biological (CB) protective overboot that requires less volume/package space than the overboots currently in use by the Joint Services.  Additionally, the Government seeks an overboot that can be manufactured for proper fit over the joint service boot population with significantly fewer sizes than overboots in the current inventory.  The development of an overboot that requires less volume is necessary to lighten the carrying weight and placement burdens on the individual warfighter, as well as to improve/lessen the overall storage and transportation requirements of CB overboots.  The AFS Acquisition Strategy  will be a full and open solicitation of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or non-developmental item (NDI) technology.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will support the Acquisition and Test Strategies.  The contemplated contract will have one base year and four option years.  The anticipated maximum quantity will be 3,000,000 pairs of chemical / biological protective overboots.

<SUBJECT>19--Naval Special Warfare 11M Rigid Inflatable Boat Total Refurbishment Support
<SOLNBR>N6133104R0033
<RESPDATE>062304
<ARCHDATE>07232004
<CONTACT>Allan Ziemba 850-235-5197 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source contract to United States Marine Incorporated (USMI) to provide total refurbishment of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) 11 meter Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIB).  The contract will be for one year with two options of one year each.  The NSW RIB is a high-speed, high-buoyancy all weather boat specifically designed to transport a fully equipped team of eight Navy SEALs and three crew members on short-range insertion and extraction missions.  Only USMI can perform the refurbishments for the following reasons.  In early summer of 1997, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded a contract to USMI to manufacture the NSW RIB. USMI has been the only source of the NSW RIB since that time.  This acquisition provides for the total refurbishment of  major systems as well as the incorporation of Engineeri ng Change Proposals (ECPs) to the NSW 11 meter RIBs.  As the sole developer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM), USMI is the only source with sufficient in-depth knowledge of the NSW RIB that could conceivably implement the refurbishment.  Additionally, the NSW RIB was procured as a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) item.  As a COTS item, the Government did not procure a full technical data package (TDP) with the hardware at that time.  The lack of a TDP makes the refurbishment of the NSW RIB by a contractor other than the OEM extremely difficult.  Use of another company to conduct the refurbishment may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable performance characteristics into the NSW RIB.    Furthermore there is a high risk that changes/deviations could be introduced into the NSW RIB that would greatly reduce its operating capabilities, cent er of gravity, weight, shock and vibration requirements, and airdrop capabilities.  Any changes in any of these parameters would greatly reduce the NSW RIB’s ability to meet mission requirements.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.

(the U.S. branch of QinetiQ, Ltd.), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1102, Arlington, VA 22202-4344 on a sole-source basis for the periscope camera system. In a cooperative effort, QinetiQ Ltd., based in the UK, created the periscope camera system, while the periscope control unit and supporting software was created in the United States. The basis for this cooperative development effort was the Information Exchange Annex (IEA) D-00-UK-0201, established 20 April, 2000 between the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (UK MoD), to the US-UK Master Information Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (MIEM) between the Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America, effective 18 November,  1994. Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334419 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is 5998.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) at NASA/LaRC is conducting an investigation into the cracking of the Shuttle Orbiter liquid hydrogen feedline flowliner. The feedline, of which the flowliner is a part, is the conduit of liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the Shuttle Main Engines. This feedline must have the ability to flex during the launch and flight of the Shuttle. In order to allow this flexing, the feedline contains several bellows assemblies. The bellows maintain feedline integrity while allowing the feedline to move about. Because of the high rate of volume passing through the feedline and the need for a rather smooth flow, some device is needed to prevent the bellows from disturbing the flow. The device that is used is called a flowliner. The flowliner, in two parts, is welded to the upper and lower parts of the same assembly as the bellows. The two parts assist in ensuring a laminar flow while allowing the bellows to flex. The flowliners themselves have numerous slots that serve two purposes - allow cleaning of the bellows area after manufacture and prevent an overpressure condition in the bellows area. Cracks began developing in the areas surrounding the slots. The cracks themselves do not constitute a problem but if a piece of debris were to break off in flight, failure of a Shuttle Main Engine could occur. Determining the nature and cause of these cracks is the focus of the NESC's Flowliner Independent Technical Assessment (IPA).  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Arrowhead Products Corporation, Los Alamitos, California.  Arrowhead Products has done extensive work for many years for the Shuttle Program. Arrowhead designed and built the feedlines and flowliners for the Shuttle and their manufactured feedlines are currently installed in all the remaining Shuttle Orbiters. A large part of the focus of the Flowliner investiagation is to examine the results of Arrowhead’s manufacturing process relative to the flowliner’s crack development.   Testing that will be conducted by the NESC Flowliner Independent Technical Assessment requires several flowliners to be welded to ‘gimbal like’ test pieces. NESC is requesting that Arrowhead manufacture these test pieces and assist in replicating portions of the feedline Gimbal assembly. This is particularly crucial to the area where the flowliner itself will be welded to the test piece. Arrowhead Products must be the sole source for this contract because of the need to replicate, as near as possible, the conditions that exist on the in-fleet Orbiters. In order for the NESC testing to prove any connection between the welding and the flowliner crack development, the exact same manufacturing process must be utilized. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and FAR 6.302-1 provide the authority for other than full and open competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has an upcoming requirement for the completion of a Nutrient Management Plan, Conservation Plan, and Recordkeeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation as part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities which, when combined into a system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource conservation goals are achieved for animal feeding operations.  The Nutrient Management Plan involves developing nutrient budgets (for all sources of nutrients used on the farm) based on crop needs, existing soil nutrient levels, and soil nutrient thresholds. The plan will include appropriate documents and field maps that identify the land base necessary to effectively utilize the manure produced.  The Conservation Plan includes the development of conservation and management practices required to minimize the movement of nutrients on the landscape and conserve the nutrient value for crop production.  This includes the planning and design of practices that address tillage and crop rotation systems, erosion and runoff control and conservation buffers.  Record-keeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation includes the collection of soil/manure samples, evaluating planned crop nutrient needs, calculating appropriate manure application rates, calibrating equipment and filing appropriate records for documentation.  Place of performance will be in various counties within South Dakota.  NAICS code is 541620.  The Request for Proposal will be available on or about June 15, 2004.  A pre-proposal site visit will be held on June 24, 2004.  Further information on the site visit will be provided in the solicitation.  Successful proposals may result in multiple awards.  Resulting contract or contracts will be of an Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity type consisting of a base year and four option years.  Task orders placed against the contract are subject to negotiations according to the terms and conditions contained therein, and under the guidelines provided in FAR Part 15.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below.  USAID has a long history of promoting justice sector improvements in Honduras since 1985.  For the 1997-2003 strategy period, USAID Honduras initiated the Strengthened Rule of Law and Respect for Human Rights (SROL I) activity.  The SROL I activity was designed to promote democracy in Honduras through support to key justice sector institutions and civil society. The objectives of the SROL I activity were: 1) a new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) effectively implemented; 2) an independent, apolitical and effective judiciary established; 3) an independent, apolitical and effective Public Ministry established; 4) broader civil society participation in justice sector reforms and monitoring; and 5) a changed mind set in the courts, in universities and elsewhere regarding the rule of law.  The activities under the SROL I activity are now being completed and will end in September 2004.
 
Significant change has occurred in the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new CPC, which introduced oral adversarial trials, more effective and transparent procedures, and greater protections for individual rights.  Nevertheless, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recognizes that numerous obstacles impede the effective functioning of the country’s legal system.  The judiciary in a democratic society must be independent of the Legislative and the Executive branches and therefore, not susceptible to improper political and economic influences from within the government and from private sector interests.  Changes in the institutional leadership that are subject to political interests threaten the reforms achieved to date and undermine the independence of key democratic institutions.  To improve the public’s confidence in its democratic systems and equal protection under the law, the Honduras justice system must strengthen its independence and protect itself from the influence of special interests that challenge the application of the rule of law.  Honduras has taken many important steps in reforming its justice sector, but further progress is required to address the rights of citizens to receive a fair hearing in court through a legal system that respects its own laws and regulations.
 
The current USAID Honduras strategy is entitled “Honduras Country Plan in Support of the Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy.”  The Country Plan was approved in August 2003 and sets forth the strategy of the USAID Honduras Mission for the period 2003-2008.  Under the new strategy, USAID/Honduras will build on the successes of the SROL I activity, particularly with regard to promoting inter-institutional approaches and developing a cadre of leadership for reform.  The new, 2-1/2 year SROL II activity will strengthen the momentum for reform within the institutions by improving the capacity of legal personnel, supporting the active engagement of professional associations to sustain justice reform, and focusing on the successful implementation of essential parts of the CPC and critical judicial independence issues.  The SROL II activity intends to increase respect for the rule of law, as well as its sustainability, by helping to deepen and diversify the constituencies that support ongoing reform.  The new activity will also introduce alternative dispute resolution as a means for increasing access to justice for marginalized groups as well as to provide another avenue to dispute resolution for commercial claimants.  Work will also support reform of the Civil Procedure Code, to introduce oral and more transparent and streamlined trial proceedings.  
 
The contractor will work closely with other donors involved in justice sector activities as well as with other USAID Honduras Strategic Objective Teams, particularly the Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO 2) in implementing activities supporting commercial claimants and civil court reforms.  One performance-based cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a 2-1/2 year period.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 24, 2004.

<SUBJECT>S -- Utilities Privatization of Electric, Water and Wastewater Systems at Fort Belvoir
<SOLNBR>SP0600-04-R-0047
<RESPDATE>032404
<CONTACT>Megan Oz, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9411, Fax 703-767-2382, Email megan.oz@dla.mil - Kerri Chambers, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-767-8567, Fax 703-767-2382, Email kerri.chambers@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system, the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort Belvoir
Location: Fort Belvoir, Virginia
Installation Description: Located in Fairfax County, near Alexandria, Virginia, Fort Belvoir covers approximately 8,600 acres.  Fort Belvoir’s daytime population is estimated to include more than 12,000 personnel: 3,000 active duty military personnel and 9,000 civilians.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
Fort Belvoir is supplied with potable water from the Fairfax County Water Authority (FCWA). Other than chlorination of water on an as needed basis, there is no water treatment at Fort Belvoir. Fort Belvoir’s potable water distribution system connects to FCWA’s main at four locations and there is one supply point that is dedicated to the Golf Course Maintenance Facility (Building 2990).
The potable water distribution system consists of pipe sizes ranging from less than 2 inches to 30 inches. The total length of the pipes is approximately 446,667 linear feet.  The water pipes are at an average depth of 3 to 4 feet. There are four water storage tanks. All tanks are of steel construction installed in 1948. The valves and piping at the tanks were upgraded in 1994. The tanks were stripped of lead paint and repainted in 1995 and 1996.

b.	Wastewater Collection System 
Fort Belvoir’s wastewater collection system includes 34 lift stations and approximately 389,122 feet of pipe/force mains. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All the wastewater is conveyed to Fairfax County Department of Public Works (FCDPW) for treatment. The wastewater is metered at seven location and flows into FCDPW’s mains at six connection points.
The sizes of collection pipes range from 4 inches in diameter to 24 inches in diameter with the majority of the pipe size being 8 inches, as summarized in Table 1. The large majority of the pipe is PVC type. Also, within the sewer collection system are 1,173 manholes. Most of the wastewater collection system was constructed between the 1940s and the 1990s, with only replacement and upgrade work being completed since 1997. The upgrade work included relining of pipes, upgrading of manholes, and some pipe replacement. 
There are 34 lift stations and associated force mains within the wastewater collection system at Belvoir. The length of the associated force mains is summarized in Table 1. Figures 3.1.2.1.a through 3.1.2.1.f depict several of the lift stations and their components.
Wastewater is collected at the Woodlawn Village housing area by gravity flow pipes, metered and transferred to FCDPW main. Wastewater from HQ DLA is metered at the Accotink and Route No. 1 and flows into FCDPW main. At the same location there is another flow meter and line, which conveys wastewater from the Airfield. Wastewater collected from other buildings north of Route No. 1, is metered and flows into FCDPW main at Guston Road and Route No. 1. Wastewater collected from buildings located south of Route No. 1 flows to Lift Station 687 or to Lift Station 97. Both of these lift stations replaced old wastewater treatment plants at Ft. Belvoir in the early 1980s. The holding tanks of the old wastewater treatment plant are still used. The pumps in the lift stations were installed to take the wastewater treatment plants out of service and transfer the wastewater to FCDPW main. Both the lift stations have wastewater meters. 

c.	Electrical Distribution System 
The primary distribution system consists of a total of approximately 90 circuit miles of 4.16 kV, 12.5 kV, 22.9 kV, and 34.5 kV circuits.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits.  The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire/wood crossarm construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks.  However, there is also a substantial amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Fort Belvoir currently purchases bulk electrical power at 34.5 kV from Dominion Virginia Power (DVP) at Substation 2540 (Humphrey's Substation), located near the northeast corner of the base.
Fort Belvoir owns and operates an electrical utility system consisting of:
·	Four 34.5 kV subtransmission switching stations
·	One 34.5 – 22.9 kV subtransmission substation
·	Eight 4.16 kV distribution substations
·	One 12.5 kV distribution substation
·	Approximately 70 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line
·	Approximately 19 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line
The electrical utility system consists of two 34.5 kV feeders supplying four 34.5 kV overhead feeders.  The 34.5 kV feeders serve as both distribution supply circuits and as sub-transmission circuits supplying one 34.5 - 22.9 kV sub-transmission substation, four 4.16 kV distribution substations, and one 12.5 kV distribution substation.  The 34.5 - 22.9 kV sub-transmission substation is the point of supply for two 22.9 kV sub-transmission circuits which then supply four 4.16 kV distribution substations.
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Megan Oz at 703-767-9411 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after March 24, 2004.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W909MY-04-R-0010
<RESPDATE>061104
<ARCHDATE>08102004
<CONTACT>Susan Whelan, 703-325-9084
<DESC>It is the intent of the US Army CECOM Acquisition Center - Washington to issue a competitive 100% small business set-aside acquisition on behalf of the US Army Communications-Electronics Command RD&E Center (CERDEC), Command and Control Directorate, Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA. CERDEC seeks to conduct advanced research and development efforts to provide product improvements to the currently fielded Army lightweight man-portable 2 kW military tactical generator (MTG) while also concurrently accelerating the research and development on the MTG successor.   The 2 kW Military Tactical Generator (MTG) is the smallest electromechanical power source in the Army inventory.  The 2 kW MTG is an open-frame generator set that is equipped with a Yanmar model L48AE-DEG, one-cylinder, air-cooled diesel engine to provide 2 kW of electrical power at either 120 volts, 60 Hertz AC or 28 volts DC, using different generator and control elements.  Both generator units emit audible noise levels of 79 dBA at 7 meters.  The wet weight of the 2 kW MTG, fully fueled and ready to oper ate, is 158 pounds for the AC unit (model MEP-531A) and 138 pounds for the DC unit (model MEP-501A).   Other present characteristics include:  Operating Fuels:  DF-1, DF-2, JP-8;  Maximum Fuel Consumption: 0.33 gph at rated load;  MTBEFF: 818/490 hrs, AC/D C sets;  Maintenance Ratio: 0.041.  The effort to be competed under this acquisition shall be focused on providing product improvements to the currently fielded Army lightweight man-portable 2 kW military tactical generator (MTG) while also concurrently accelerating the research and developm ent on the MTG successor.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the general areas of tasks that may be undertaken, data to be prepared, and performance objectives for the research and development of product improvements for the 2 kW MTG.  Efforts may focus  on making improvements in the following topical areas:  Acoustic Signature; Weight;  Reliability and Maintainability;  Fuel Consumption; Power Quality; Deployability and Survivability.  Any product improvements initiated must be able to clearly demonstrat e operationally significant benefits;  these benefits shall aim to meet or exceed the Product Improvement Program / Successor thresholds and objectives, where the baseline system is the current 2 kW MTG as represented.  It is recognized that not all of the  objectives may be attainable, and no offer is required to address all of the objectives.      In all cases, simplicity, durability and ruggedness are desired characteristics of any modifications directed at product improvements.  Technologies and investigations with well defined approaches which are applicable to improving the current 2 kW MTG and/ or to accelerating the research and development on the MTG successor will be considered.  A general purpose successor must be able to start and operate, to full rated capacity, using JP-8, DF-1 and DF-2 fuels, as a minimum. Product improvement efforts init iated must be able to clearly demonstrate improvements over the current 2 kW MTG system performance characteristics as listed above. Existing contracted efforts are addressing noise and weight reduction individually and combined. The current total program budget is for this acquisition is $1.8 million.  The CECOM Acquistiion Center anticipates making multiple awards if multiple acceptable solutions are available within the evaluation criteria and if funding permits.  CECOM intends to issue a draft SOW for the 2kW military generator (MTG) product improvement program.  The draft RFP will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  No hard copies or copies via email will  be available.  The Draft SOW is expected to be released on or about 3 May 2004. A 15 day time period subsequent to the issuance of the Draft RFP will be allowed for respondents to submit comments and questions reg arding the content of the Draft SOW. The final RFP is expected to be released on or about 18 May 2004. Firms interested in submitting comments and questions regarding the content of the Draft SOW will be provided instructions on the Interactive Business Op portunities Page.

<DESC>The Geography Division, United States Census Bureau (Census Bureau) is conducting a competition in accordance with PL 920582 (Brooks Architect&#64979;Engineer Act) and FAR 36 to enter into a contract with  a period of performance from award date through September 30, 2008. This contract is for collection of accurate coordinate datasets to support the coordinate evaluation of TIGER files that have been processed through the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project (MTAIP) coordinate improvement operations.  Also coordinate evaluation data is required to evaluate the location accuracy of Geographic Information System (GIS) files and other files that are potential sources of spatial data, for which the spatial accuracy must be statistically evaluated and the results recorded in the metadata.  It is anticipated that from contract award through GFY 2008 coordinate QA will be required for up to 1200 areas. The schedule is dependent on a number of factors beyond the Census Bureau’s control.  Consequently the contract type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract with individual task orders for a well-defined workload of a definite number of named counties or areas.  Each task order will be priced as a fixed price task order.  This task requires the collection via creation or procurement of coordinate QA evaluation datasets.  The Census Bureau requires these Coordinate QA datasets to determine the coordinate accuracy of local government supplied GIS files, other coordinate source files, and coordinate enhanced TIGER files.  The project shall be known as “Accurate Coordinate Datasets Collection (ACDC).”

The anticipated award date is September 9, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Census Bureau.  Expressions of interest should be forwarded via Email to the above contact (philip.michael.hodges@census.gov) within 15 calendar days after the issue date of this Notice.  Fifteen (15) days after the issue date of this notice, a solicitation document will be published electronically on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Web site at two locations.

<CONTACT>CHERIE SEE,937-257-4774 X 4411
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND MARKET RESEARCH FOR PLANNING PURPOSES				 1.  The Specialized Contracting Branch, ASC/PKWIE, Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base, OH is currently requesting information and conducting market research to  determine the best acquisition strategy through contract award for support of  the Consolidated Healthcare Asset Management Program (CHAMP) for Air Force  Material  Command Surgeon+s (AFMC/SG) office. 2. The CHAMP concept evolved from the AFMC Command Surgeon’s (AFMC/SG) need to  control costs and maintain its assets more effectively and efficiently.   Historically, AMFC/SG Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) and medical  equipment assets were maintained separately by a military and civil service  work force augmented by service contracts.   Because of changing force  structures and mission orientations, exclusive reliance an in-house workforce  was no longer economically feasible.  Recently, AFMC/SG assets were combined on  a medical equipment and RPIE assets management contract: The contractor  supplies a local program administrator and subcontracts out all maintenance.   The contractor charges a fixed annual amount for all preventative and  corrective maintenance coverage of selected assets; single point management and  provides historical maintenance data support. 3. In an effort to expand and improve CHAMP, our goal is to develop an  acquisition strategy that will result in a contractual vehicle that allows us  to achieve outstanding performance while significantly reducing our cost of  doing business with a manageable level of risk.  Key areas of interest include  the following:   ·	Contract Structure ·	Number of Contracts – single vs. multiple ·	Scope of each contract if more than one ·	Contract type(s) including incentives ·	Contract length ·	Cost reduction -- Enablers or constraints that affect: ·	Process management and improvement methodologies ·	Increasing workforce flexibility, efficiency, and agility ·	Opportunities for public/private partnerships ·	Teaming arrangements ·	Other areas that might shape our acquisition strategy 4.  Please provide responses to the above general areas, the specific questions  below and any other area(s) that you feel would assist in the development of an  acquisition strategy.   a.  How would you organize the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) across Air  Force Material Command (AFMC), in order to maximize the economies of scale and  to increase efficiencies? The locations currently under consideration for this  program are: ·	Brooks City Base, Texas ·	Edwards AFB, California ·	Eglin AFB, Florida ·	Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts ·	Hill AFB, Utah ·	Kirtland AFB, New Mexico ·	Robins AFB, Georgia ·	Tinker AFB, Oklahoma ·	Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio b.  Site visits and/or Industry Days are a normal part of the Request for  Proposal process.  If site visits are offered would you want to visit all  locations or a sample of a large and small facility? c.  Can your organization manage both medical equipment and Real Property  Installed Equipment (RPIE)? d.  What is the most effective means at your disposal to offer one-stop  management of our maintenance requirements: medical equipment and RPIE?  Our  requirements are: ·	Timeliness ·	Quality service/technical expertise ·	Reduced scheduled downtime ·	Cost reduction ·	Cost stability ·	Program flexibility ·	Management expertise ·	Repair documentation e.  Our research has revealed the most cost effective method of maintenance  involves strategic partnering.  What incentive programs can your company  propose to the government to partner with industry (i.e. cost sharing, rebates,  price reductions, etc.)? f.  The MTFs on this program range from 100-bed in-patient facilities to  business occupancy clinics.  Considering AFMC Command Surgeon (AFMC/SG) must,  with some confidence, be sure we are comparing apples to apples when cross- referencing ROE for the facilities.  What pricing strategies are best suited  for this program? g.  If you have a current medical equipment and/or RPIE contract, what pricing  strategy is used?  Would you be willing to provide a copy of your current  contract to include the Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement? h.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires us to use Performance Based  Service Acquisition (PBSA) and within that model the requirement exists for  contract incentives and penalties also exist.  What management strategies are  best suited to this program? 5.  This is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).   This is a request for information and market research and the Government will  not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation submitted  under this request. 6.  Interested parties are requested to provide information by 14 May 2004 to  ASC/PKWIE, Cherie See, to email address:  www.cherie.see@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>NA The Garrison Commander, Fort Myer, Virginia announced on 7 August 2003 its tentative decision to retain in-house the Base Operations Support Services functions. This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Man agement and Budget Circular A-76. The final analysis indicated that the Government did not receive any acceptable private-sector offer to compete against the Most Efficient Organization (MEO). There was no cost comparison and the tentative decision in the Base Operations Support Services study is to implement the MEO.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify the difference between two solicitation numbers F11626-03-R0017 and F11626-03-R-0017.  Both of these solicitations pertain to the same Worldwide Express Small Package Service opportunity and the only difference between the two numbers is a missing dash (-) after the R in the solicitation number.  The correct solicitation number should read:  F11626-03-R-0017.  Because of the missing dash (-), the Federal Business Opportunity website treats them as two separate solicitations, when in fact, they are the same solicitation.  Therefore, the three postings listed under F11626-03-R0017 (solicitation number without dash):  Synopsis posted 26 Feb 04, Vendor Questions posted 17 Mar 04, and Amendment 01 posted 22 Apr 04 are applicable to 
F11626-03-R-0017 (solicitation number with dash).  Based on the above situation, Amendment 01 posted on 26 Apr 04 to F11626-03-R-0017 (solicitation number with dash) is incorrectly labeled Amendment 01 and should read Amendment 02.

APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  4 June 2004.  The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, Cost Plus Award Fee, follow-on contract for a base period and 6 one-year option periods.  This effort is to provide engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a seven-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include one-year options for the following six fiscal years (FY06 through FY11).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance.  AWPS/AAI provides tools for production management, operations and quality review, damage calculations, and plan analysis.  Upcoming enhancements and development projects are potentially as follows: continuation of software improvement and maintenance efforts using SQL, PowerBuilder, Fortran; possible conversion all FORTRAN applications to C++.  The ISPAN program is undergoing modernization, based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directions.  AWPS/AAI may require some new development and tools integration efforts.  Currently, the data base management system is Sybase, but efforts are underway to migrate to the Oracle platform.  All software will be maintained and developed in accordance with applicable DOD and AF regulations and standards, and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and Architectures.  The contractor must maintain a SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for SECRET documents and equipment.  All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance.  Any contractor personnel required to work on the  ISPAN computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed.  This acquisition will not be conducted using commercial procedures per FAR Part 12.  The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry.  No solicitation is available at this time.  Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner.  All associated documents will be released electronically.  The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $21M.  Anticipated award date is 17 Nov 2004.  Address questions via e-mail to the contract specialist or contracting officer only.  No discussions will be conducted telephonically.  Numbered notes 9 and 26 apply.

<DESC>This sources-sought notice previously was issued under Classificaton Code 39 - Materials Handling Equipment and NAICS Code 333921 - Elevator and Moving Stairway Manufacturing.

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Upstate New York Service Center is conducting market research to determine the availability of commercial items and commercial installation services (construction) for the replacement of a sidewalk freight elevator in Buffalo, NY. The Michael J. Dillon U.S. Courthouse is a 1930's vintage building with the current Gillespie PS-1E electric sidewalk freight elevator design and capacity that were adequate for that period. The elevator car and other major components of this elevator have been replaced, however the unit has not been upgraded to handle the capacity required to satisfy the current needs of the tenants. The existing car platform and car capacity needs to be increased.  

The existing sidewalk elevator occupies a pit containing both the elevator shaft and the elevator mechanical room. To increase the size of the car, the floor of the mechanical room will require excavation to bring it down to the depth of the elevator shaft with necessary concrete work to accept a new hydraulic two-stop elevator. With the shaft modifications, a car platform of approximately 6'-3" x 9'-8" could be accommodated with 3000-pound capacity. The overall dimension of the shaft will be 11'-0"x6'-5" following the planned modifications. Space is available within the adjacent basement area for the new elevator mechanical room containing the hydraulic pump, controller, and electrical disconnect.  

Manufacturers of replacement sidewalk elevator systems, or their authorized local dealers/installers, are requested to respond with commercial catalog cut sheets or a website reference to the attention of Ms. Harriet Mortas at the attached address. Please indicate the elevator manufacturer, car size, door size, capacity, options, and any applicable constraints in meeting the objectives described above. The agency is interested in learning about any standard commercial terms and conditions applicable to the replacement of sidewalk freight elevators. Please also identify the business size status of both the manufacturer and authorized local dealer/installer according to the following categories: large business, small business, Section 8(a), other certified small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, or veteran-owned small business. The tentative NAICS code for the potential future procurement action is 238990 with a size standard of $12 million.  

This is a sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses are requested by May 11, 2004.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine  Industry’s capabilities to deliver a breaching system for the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV).  The ABV is a single platform that will provide deliberate and in-stride breaching capability to the assault force of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  It is based on the Abrams M1A1 Main Battle Tank chassis and incorporates a new turret, linear demolition charge system, protective weapon system, remote control system, and breaching system. The ABV operates as part of a combined arms task force and is assigned to and employed by Combat Engineers as part of a synchronized operation to rapidly breach obstacles and create a cleared lane for other vehicles in the MAGTF to safely pass through.  The ABV program is structured to achieve full operational capability in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007. The breaching system for the ABV is comprised of several subsystems which include the following blade attachments: one full width mine plow (FWMP), one V-shaped surface mine plow (VSSMP), one side casting surface mine plow (SCSMP), and a dozer blade (DB). Additionally, two lane marking systems comprise the remaining part of the breaching system. The Breaching System will be required to be delivered at a rate as follows:  Three (3) units by first quarter FY05, then three (3) units per quarter until third quarter FY07, for a total of 33 breaching systems.  
 The components of the Breaching System for the ABV shall be compliant with the following requirements:

Full Width Mine Plow(FWMP:

The FWMP clears surface laid and buried mines to provide a lane for combat vehicles and Marines to pass through.  The FWMP shall survive the equivalent of two separate 21 pound, anti-tank mine detonations on its blade/plow assembly and complete the mission.  The FWMP shall have a travel-lockout to hold and lock the blade in its stowed position during vehicle travel.  The FWMP shall be detachable within 10 minutes (threshold), 5 minutes (objective), using basic issue items and on-board equipment.  The FWMP shall have the capability to hydraulically jettison from under armor.  The approach angle of the FWMP equipped on the ABV shall be no less than 17 degrees.

<SUBJECT>R -- Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare Software and Training
<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), intent to negotiate, on a sole source basis, to modify our contract with Jeff Murray’s Programming Shop of New Orleans, Louisiana.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.  The purpose of this negotiation is to acquire their Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare software and training, which will allow direct extensions of the current application and therefore enable its use in international HIV treatment settings.  This modification to the existing contract will permit changes in internal codes and redesign of certain screens of the current proprietary software.  The current contractor is the only one who can make these adjustments.           
The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the Upgrading and Supporting RW CAREWare software and will now be required to spend a small amount of effort to upgrade, again.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  
This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to modify an existing contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>R -- The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to solicit the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) for the recruitment and screening of Hispanic Americans for referral to the OPM for developmental assignments.  This is in support of an on-going program that is part of the OPM Director’s plans to implement the President’s Executive Order to provide increased employment opportunities for Hispanic Americans in the Federal workplace.  
OPM intends to issue a five (5) year contract with a base year and four (4) optional years.  Assignments will be for fifteen (15) weeks in the spring and fall programs and ten (10) weeks for the summer program.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 541612 and the small business standard is 6.0 million per year.

The contractor will be responsible for the following services:

1.  Recruitment - The contractor will attract a qualified pool of applicants through a campaign of recruitment visits to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), targeted direct mailings, attendance at conferences, responses to inquires, and an informational HNIP web page.  

2.  Employment Administration- The contractor will receive and process applications. The contractor will match student applications with intern assignments provided by OPM, process payroll, coordinate periodic performance evaluations, and provide guidance and support for the interns over the course of the assignment.  As contractor employees, students will be paid a stipend based on their academic level according to a predetermined rate.

3.  Orientation - The contractor will conduct orientation activities in Washington, D.C., the weekend before interns report to their assignments.  The first day of work will be typically designated as a general introduction to OPM.

4.  Extra Curricular Activities - The contractor will organize a series of meetings that will enhance the intern’s professional experience and provide them with additional networking opportunities.  In addition, the contractor will arrange for students to attend a minimum of three (3) of the following cultural tours: the White House, Pentagon, FBI, Capitol, Library of Congress, and Government Printing Office.  The cultural tours will be arranged during all 3 sessions: spring, summer, and fall.

5.  Academic Credit - Students will have the opportunity to receive academic credit while working in the program.  Students must work to obtain approval from their academic advisor or dean.  While this may not be possible in some cases, we anticipate that the majority of the semester-long interns will receive credit for their internship experience, as this is a priority to OPM.  The contractor will notify and work with students and their academic advisor or deans to ensure that appropriate documentation and procedures are in place to allow the home institution to award credit.                                                                                                                 


6.  Student and Supervisor Support Services - The contractor will provide support services that include program handbooks, regular written updates, and information about career and educational opportunities.  In addition, the contractor staff will conduct site visits and maintain frequent communication by phone, newsletters, e-mails and fax.

7.  Housing -The contractor will assist interns in arranging safe, furnished, affordable housing near public transportation that will be accessible to OPM work locations.  In case of field placements, the contractor will work with OPM supervisors to meet the above stated criteria.

 
8.  Travel - The contractor will provide round-trip transportation to all interns.

9.  Evaluation - The contractor will conduct a complete program evaluation at the end of the program and submit a final report to OPM.  The report will include feedback from interns as well as supervisors.  

OPM believes that only HACU can meet the goals of this procurement because it has an applicant pool that is 90% Hispanic.  Their recruitment process is national in scope and does not discriminate against non-Hispanic applicants.    Furthermore, the HACU national intern program is nationally recognized for the quality of it program and interns.

Interested firms capable of providing this service must submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) describing the size and ethnicity of the applicant pool from which they would draw, the process by which applicants are selected on a non-discriminatory basis, a description of previous experience recruiting Hispanic students nationally for their intern program, and a description of the intern program offered to students recruited.  Companies must also submit information regarding the estimated cost per student for each term.  

This is not a solicitation.  The Government will use responses to this synopsis to help determine if the solicitation of HACU on a noncompetitive basis is justified.  See Note 22.  

Responses should be addressed to Ms. Terry L. Anderson and submitted to the address above, not later than 3:00 p.m., May 14, 2004.  Faxes may be sent to 202-606-1464.   

The OPM is a secured Government facility, and the Contractor is responsible for arriving in sufficient time to be processed through security.  Late delivery may result in rejection of the Contractor’s proposal.  All SOCs received after the closing date and not postmarked at least five (5) days prior to the closing date, will be considered late and will not be given consideration.  Extensions of the deadline will not be granted.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  The following item has been identified: Executive Metal Stapler (7520-00-NSH-0093).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Portable Scanners
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures for 600 Visioneer XP100 Portable Scanners with USB and Serial Interface Kit – Part #SXP1001-DB. OCC has a number of Visioneer scanners and is looking for standardization both as it applies to the user environment and scanners.  Visioneer’s swappable parts will fit most, if not all, Visioneer scanners, and the OCC has made the decision to stock the most common parts for their scanners to limit downtime in the event of failure and to minimize the risk of multiple failures. The interoperability of parts provides significant savings to the OCC. Standardizing hardware also benefits potential recovery should a disaster render a scanner unusable and saves training dollars for IT staff.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued.  All offers received within 5 days after the date of this publication with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC.  Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If the task is completed earlier than 30 June 2004, we would have no further requirement for these specific services.    
The specific task is to cover duties of a journeyman supply systems analyst for the UADPS-U2 system during the temporary assignment of key personnel to the Enterprise Resource System (ERP) project at Annapolis, Maryland.  This temporary assignment has placed additional workload on existing staff that cannot be absorbed.    
We have an emergent requirement for a qualified Systems Analyst for UADPS-U2 applications such as: replenishment, demand processing, files maintenance, dues management, and receiving.  The employee must be proficient in Microsoft Office products in addition to supply and logistics processes.   

This person must be able to perform the following duties:

Additionally, the government will supply the contractor with all applicable written procedures and any hardware or software documentation that is required by the contractor for the identified tasks.  A supervisory point of contact will be provided for any issues related to the contract.  

6.  Status Reports.
	
	The contractor will provide the supervisor with a written status report of progress on assigned tasks on a weekly basis.  This can be in the form of an email.

7.  Physical Requirements.

	Accomplishment of this task will require the contractor to be able to gain access to the FISC Puget Sound complex, including outlying sites such as the Intermediate Maintenance Facility (IMF) Bangor and the Manchester Fuel Depot.  We will need the name, social security number, date of birth, and citizenship of each contract employee that will need access to our site in the performance of this task.  
	A security clearance is not required to perform this task.  However, the contractor will have access to Privacy Act information and must adhere to Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a.  Telephones are for official or emergency personal use only.
	This task will require the contractor to be on-site during normal business hours, Monday through Friday with a 30-minute lunch break.  The contractor may be required to work occasional overtime if system implementations are scheduled during the contract period.  The work being performed is within a secure building and access will be provided.  The work will not require lifting above 20 lbs.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  DESC issues Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 for the free issuance of 500 fuel purchase credit cards permitting US Government employees to obtain an estimated 60,000 gallons of Premium Unleaded Gasoline, NSN 9130-01-485-0982, EN 228, Line Item 002-27; an estimated 40,000 gallons of Diesel Fuel, NSN 9140-01-493-5556, EN 590, Line Item 002-13; and an estimated 500 gallons of Motor Oil, Name Brand Specification, Line Item 002-C5 from the contractor’s service stations within France.  The card system should have the capability to separate fuel purchase data from motor oil purchase data, bill fuel to one payment office and bill motor oil to another, and have security procedures to prohibit the purchase of other goods and services.  The invoice data should be reported at Level III, invoices should indicate the quantity purchased during each transaction, and any taxes should be excluded or shown separated.  Card usage should be limited to France, but not geographically limited within France.  Card usage is anticipated on major roadways between the German border and lower Normandy and within the lower Normandy area.  All U.S. military and civilian personnel of the U.S. government who operate official U.S. government owned/leased vehicles or military vehicles and posses valid cards and official dispatch orders for operation of said vehicles at time of delivery will be authorized to use these cards.  Cards should be printed with a “TF LOG 60” identified on the card and on invoices.  Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 is being issued as a request for proposals and constitutes the only solicitation.  The performance period is from 15 May 2004 to 30 June 2004.  The government shall not be liable for transactions made after the expiration date of the contract.  The NAICS code is 424720 and the small business size standard is 500.  

DESC may conduct discussions with offerors submitting proposals under subject solicitation, but due to time constraints it anticipates awarding a contract based on the initial offer submitted.  Each offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint.  Award will be made to a single card provider and items will be awarded on an all-or-none basis.  Award decisions will be based on a Best Value determination of three factors:  technical proposal (i.e., Charge Card System capabilities and service station network meeting or exceeding DESC’s needs), price and past performance.  Offerors are advised that the Government is more interested in obtaining quality performance than lowest price and may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  However, the Government will not pay a price premium that it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the offeror’s technical proposal or record of past performance.  In determining best overall value, the Government will evaluate and rate each offeror’s technical proposal and past performance based on pre-established standards.  The technical proposal is of greater importance than price and past performance combined.  Between price and past performance, price is of greater importance.  The offer selected as best value will represent the best tradeoff to the Government among technical proposal, price, and past performance.  

The provision at FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offer packages should include along with prices, 1) a description of the credit card’s capabilities and extent to which the credit card can meet the stated requirements; 2) a statement of the timeframe from contract award to distribution of cards to the customer, 3) an explanation of the offeror’s card distribution method and procedures for replacing lost or stolen cards, 4) identification of any replacement, transaction or other fees included in the offer price, and 5) a list or map indicating locations of service stations that accept the cards that are situated along the Germany-to-Normandy roadways and in the lower Normandy area and the service station’s hours of operation when they accept credit cards.  Prices should be in Euros per liter.  Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, with their offer.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The Offer Submission Package and the following clauses are available in full text (see reference package posted to the France PC&S Homepage):  B19.02, Economic Price Adjustment (Overseas), I1.04, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, I1.05, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, and L2.05-5, Instructions To Offerors – Commercial Items (PCS).  All documents associated with Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 can be found at the identified Web address. 

The Government contemplates award of a Requirements Type, Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment contract resulting from this solicitation.  After award, the contract price will escalate / de-escalate in accordance with Clause B19.02, Economic Price Adjustment (Overseas)(DESC Aug 2000) as stated in the reference package.

See, original posting of 16 April 2004.  This amendment 0002 is to answer questions received on the original posting, as follows (questions may be paraphrased, where necessary, to conserve space):

QUESTIONS ARE NUMBERED SEQUENTIALLY FROM AMENDMENT 0001, WHICH CONTAINED QUESTIONS 1-4.

QUESTION 5:  We were given a scaled set of drawings (as part of a market survey conducted by the technical personnel) and the square footage is 12,410, not 12,000 sq ft – a difference of 3%.  Should we quote 12,000 sq ft then later seek a change order to cover the additional square footage?

ANSWER 5:  At first we calculated around 12,500 sq ft.  Since then, we had to go back and recalculate to 12,000 sq ft because there is a test patch that will be applied (approximately 350-400 sq ft).  The JSF program will have the test patch applied.  

QUESTION 6:  In our estimate, we quoted to filter the water, perform a representative TCLP for heavy metals, and place the non-hazardous effluent water down the sanitary sewer, which is a standard practice for our customers.  Note:  the nearest facility that will take the effluent water is in Sparrows Point, which can only be hauled in 5,000-gallon lots due to weight constraints and will result in an additional cost per gallon.  Patuxent River has its own water treatment facility.  

ANSWER 6:  The Government will dispose of the filtered water.

QUESTION 7:  We first estimated completing this project in 21-22 working days after set-up.  The Government wanted completion in 10 days, so we reworked our quote to complete in 10 days after set-up with good weather each working day.  What is the requirement now for working days to complete after set-up?  

ANSWER 7:  The Government still requires completion within 10-12 good weather working days to meet our required completion date of 1 June 2004.  

QUESTON 8:  Please make note that the only Non-Skid qualified to be used in a landing area is MIL-PRF-24667, TYPE 1, Composition “L” (non-abrasive type).  If this is not listed in the solicitation, another contractor may not be aware of this requirement and quote Comp. “G”, which is general use non-skid.  

ANSWER 8:  The application required at this site is Type “L” and we recommend that ASTI MS 400L or AMERON 1368R be applied, or any similar application (if any) that meets the Type “L” specifications.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STARDUST CLEANROOM - RFO# NNJ04060551Q: Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to the combined synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to address the following questions and associated answers. Questions and answers regarding the RFO# NNJ04060551Q are also posted on the Stardust Cleanroom Acquisition Website and can be located by accessing	   http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/scr/default.asp	 Questions and answers are numbered sequentially and are in congruence with the "Questions and Answers" posted on NAIS and the Stardust Cleanroom Acquistion Website.  QUESTION 4: I noticed that besides the air sampling, that addressable detection is also required per item # 26 in the Statement of Work. Is this correct? ANSWER TO QUESTION 4: Air sampling type detection is the only fire detection requirement inside the Stardust Cleanroom.	Inadvertently, item #26 of the Statement of Work (SOW) included both "air sampling type detection" and "addressable smoke detection" as requirements for the Stardust Cleanroom. To clarify, the outer room must have "addressable smoke detection" which will be provided by the "Construction Contractor."  "Air sampling detection" is required by the prospective offeror inside the Stardust Cleanroom. The Stardust Cleanroom SOW is revised to state the above.  Please view the Stardust Cleanroom Acquisition Website by accessing    http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/scr/default.asp   to view the Stardust Cleanroom Statement of Work.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 adds the full text of ATTACHMENT 1, W914NS-04-R-0133. 

TOP LOADING CONTAINER HANDLERS
Statement of Work:   

	1.   SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the purchase and testing of four (4) Top Loading Container Handlers (TLCH), warranty, and preventative maintenance training. This purchase will include associated training and spare parts and tooling lists allowing for completion of routine maintenance for a period of 1 (one) year after delivery. Additionally, vendor must demonstrate through a Statement of Qualification that that it is an ongoing entity with past sales and service experience for the offered item for a ten (10) year period.

	1.1 Background.  The Supplemental Allocation provided in the 2207 Report and the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Program Management Office (PMO) has been initiated to design, develop, produce, and deploy services, products, and construction to support rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of Iraq. The Port of Umm Qasar is an integral part of the infrastructure rebuilding and improvement efforts to move goods, people, and raw materials supporting inter-state and international commerce and exchange. To support this effort TLCHs are necessary to allow movement of Containers between the Ports Container Cranes, flatbed trailers and rail and truck staging areas. This capability is essential to the efficient movement of materials between sea ports, rail heads, and truck carriers. The TLCH specification is a commercial material handling equipment specification. The desired equipment must meet or exceed the specifications of the Taylor Machine Works THDC-955 MIT Loaded Container Handler. Due to degraded training and supply chain operations, a 1 (one) year on-site maintenance agreement covering parts and service is required for the interim rebuilding operations. Due to the poor state of trained personnel training covering routine maintenance for 25 personnel should be made, upon mutual agreement between the awardee and the Umm Qasar Port Manager, available at the Port facilities to occur no more than 30 days after delivery. Finally, while the industry is in an infant state of development it is important that capital equipment buys have long-term viability, therefore the customer seeks to reduce risk by elimination proposals from individuals without the financial stability and standard capacity to support after-sales service of the equipment.
