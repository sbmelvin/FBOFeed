<DESC>Bronx VANAP TO Acquire: Biomedical Engineering is requesting that the VTS monitors be a sole source purchase.  The choice contractor will be Olympus Medical.  Olympus is a sole distributor for VTS.   Olympus provides the VA to inter-connect seamlessly the clinical Olympus surgical equipment with other clinical equipment and non-clinical video inputs to integrate images and data and supply them to the surgical field.    VTS monitors offer a high quality, precision unit; sleek design and fully enclosed monitor that surpasses the current flat panel medical display solutions. The InVision 18.1 is a versatile surgical display that supports (5) individual video inputs: RGB-Sync, SDI, S-Video, Y-C, DVI, and Analog.  The InVision 18.1 is capable of handling all brands and types of surgical imaging equipment and designed to grow with changing technology such as SDI. Five input design provides optimum flexibility and adaptability.  Live video or VGA graphics can be displayed from any camera or physiological monitoring device.  The InVision Series offers advanced LCD technology with high contrast, fast video response with no image lag. Viewing to an unprecedented 170°-viewing angle, enabling data to be read more readily.  In my professional opinion, the liability that we at the Bronx VAMC carry going with any other video monitor company with no surgical specifications would be a grave situation. Place of Performance is Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 130 W. Kingsbridge Rd. Bronx, NY 10468.

The Mobile Showers for use in special assigned projects and other field operations must be wheeled, towable, aircraft portable trailers capable of accommodating showering facilities for 6 agents (3 female, 3male) each.   On a typical operation, secondary, unpaved roads are the norm, and mobile showers will typically be ported along these types of routes.   Climatic conditions during projects and other field operations run the gamut of extremes from cold, winter-like conditions in February and March to extremely hot conditions during the summer months.  The wide range of weather extremes necessitates that each mobile shower facility must exhibit both electric heat and air-conditioning capabilities.   These mobile showers will be the only available means of showering locations and will be used daily for an extended period of time in remote locations.  The mobile showers must be capable of being used time and time again, and should be able to be used for nearly any type of operation including training operations, humanitarian operations, and emergency operations.  The Border Patrol Tactical Unit will utilize mobile showers to conduct operations in a multitude of environmental conditions and climates throughout the United States.  In order to meet these wide range of needs, mobile showers must exhibit certain specifications and characteristics.  The following specifications must be present in any mobile sleeping quarters purchased by the United States Border Patrol.

<DESC>This requirement is to provide standard Internet access to specified education centers with possible expansion for family support, libraries and other services.  This requirement will be referred to as People Program Network (PPN).  Requirements are detailed in Section 2 of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Note:   Determination to execute Phase II, Task 2 to extend DMARC is dependent upon funding and performance.  Therefore this Task may not be required.

Proposals will be evaluated on BEST VALUE basis which includes past performance, past experience, cost and other considerations.  Other considerations in this case are the network performance, service guaranty and network management capabilities.  Specific criteria are contained in Section 8.0 of this SOW.
1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	Organization

Air Force Education and Training Centers
			
1.2	Mission

The mission of Air Force Education and Training is to provide educational/training opportunities to military personnel and their families as well as support military and college level testing already contracted by the Government.  

1.3	Project Background and Objectives
The purpose of this requirement is to provide a standard Internet access solution for Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) base activities providing network connectivity for military members and their families.  The Internet access solution is focused on education centers at Los Angles Air Force Base, Vandenberg AFB, Malmstrom AFB, FE Warren AFB, Buckley AFB, Peterson AFB and Patrick AFB.  However it may also include other people programs activities such as for family support, libraries and services to the extent funding allow. 
The military NIPRNET is restricted to official users.  Office of the Secretary of Defense and AF/SC policy, AFI 33-129, AFSSI 5027, and CJCSI6111.02A all require persons accessing the NIPRNET, at minimum, to have a completed National Agency Check (NAC, ENTAC, or equivalent) verified through the automated security clearance approval system (ASCAS) roster.  These policy requirements drive a technical solution for a network separate from NIPRNET henceforth referred to as People Program Network (PPN).  All workstations associated with People Program Network (PPN) activities that don’t qualify for NIPRNET will connect to PPN.
The commercial ISP contractor will bring service to a demarcation (demarc) point at the Base Central Office (BCO) or Network Control Center (NCC) via an ISP provided DS1 facility.  The ISP will provide and manage a nation-wide frame relay network, security services (e.g. firewall), Network Management Service (NMS) and Domain Name Services (DNS).  The local communications squadrons will extend ISP access to PPN activities using the initial set of centrally purchased equipment (e.g. modems, switches) and base cable plant (copper or fiber).   Annual recurring ISP costs will continue to be centrally funded; however, equipment to add future PPN activities will be funded by the user.  Baseline security policy will initially block all inbound services and filter outbound traffic as appropriate.  

The PPN allows ISP services, currently funded by the wing and/or supported by communication squadron infrastructure, to be terminated.   Future connections to the PPN can be accomplished at the cost of modems and the labor to install.   Recurring ISP costs remain unchanged until additional bandwidth is deemed necessary.  Support to non-appropriated activities will require reimbursement based on an appropriate prorata share formula.

Internet access is required for student use in research, communication with schools, classroom instruction, distance learning and testing.  It is increasingly difficult to meet mission requirements with the restrictions of the military NIPRNET.   Commercial Internet connection will resolve this issue and allow for the expanding connectivity requirements of our colleges and universities and Advanced Distributive Learning (ADL) initiatives proposed by the Air Force for military and civilian training.

1.4	Scope

Provide Internet access to demarcation points at Base Central Office or Network Control Center via an ISP provided DS1 facility.  Access is required for education centers at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Vandenberg AFB, Malmstrom AFB, FE Warren AFB, Buckley AFB, Peterson AFB and Patrick AFB.  Initial requirements are for Internet access for Malmstrom AFB, Buckely AFB, Patrick AFB and Vandenberg AFB.  Additional education center access may be required.  Access for other programs including family support, libraries and services may be required.

1.5	Contract Type

If available use FSS Schedule.  If not FSS Schedule, cite open market pricing, showing discounts where applicable.  Tasks are predominately Firm Fixed Price (FFP) with some Time and Materials (T&M).  Phase I is Firm Fixed Price, and Phase II, if exercised, is T&M.
