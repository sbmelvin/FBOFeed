<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for 1 ea Ruska Autofloat Dead Weight Calibrator. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Ruska Instrument Corporation.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical because this instrument is the recommended equipment for calibration of the existing Ruska Pressure Sensor Characterization and Test System.  The calibrator and test system are 100% compatible, which will provide accurate and consistent traceability to previous calibrations of the system and also to the NIST Standard.  The system has unique characteristics in that the calibrator can be operated in either an absolute pressure mode or gage pressure mode.  Another unique feature is the ability to change ranges by selection of piston assemblies yielding incredible accuracies for a chosen range.  There is no known calibrator that can meet the accuracy requirements and the ability to provide these accuracies in either a gage mode or absolute pressure mode for calibration of the Ruska Pressure Sensor Characterization and Test System. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on May 8, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A--SMALL HEAVY FUEL ENGINE (SHFE) PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>DAAH10-03-R-0007
<RESPDATE>070803
<ARCHDATE>09062003
<CONTACT>Patricia Wells, 757-878-0104
<DESC>NA NA POC Ms. Pattie Wells, Contract Specialist, 757-878-0104.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.3 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitte d in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement.     INTRODUCTION:   The intent of the Small Heavy Fuel Engine (SHFE) program is to take advantage of recent component efforts under DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program and other recent advanced technology efforts to ad vance the state-of-the-art of small turbine engines. Accordingly, this announcement is for the development of a 700 shaft horsepower engine to demonstrate advanced small gas turbine technology for potential application to multiple military and commercial v ehicles.  The overall goals of the SHFE program are a 20% reduction in Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), a 50% improvement in Shaft Horsepower to Weight (shp/wt), a 35% reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a 10% reduction in development cost re lative to year 2000 fielded systems. The SHFE program will emphasize the development of innovative component technologies and / or cycle configurations to address overall and part power performance.  Improved part-power fuel consumption characteristics are  needed to meet the emerging endurance and cruise requirements associated with future Army aviation platforms.   Increased range and endurance drive the need for efficient propulsion capability over a wide operating envelope.  The SHFE development will als o address the need to minimize overall vehicle operation and support costs.  The improved fuel consumption, reliability and maintainability characteristics and the emphasis on lower production and maintenance costs for the gas turbine engine approach will target the goal to reduce O&S costs by 35%.  The SHFE program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE initiative.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors, such  a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation.  The 700 horsepower SHFE demonstrator program is anticipated for award in the 1st quarter FY04.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The SHFE program will consist of design, fabricati on, and component and engine demonstration testing to achieve the program goals (stated in detail below) for the Armys Objective Force fleet of manned and unmanned rotorcraft. Demonstration testing should include performance and durability testing along w ith weight demonstration.  SHFE program engine level goals include:  Less than or equal to 0.52 specific fuel consumption (based on a 350 SHP, 50% IRP point) Greater than or equal to 4.4 Horsepower to Weight ratio @ IRP  Less than or equal to $165k per eng ine production cost (including basic HMU or FADEC control system) is defined as the average production cost of the first 1000 engines over a 10 year production period. Greater than or equal to 5000 hours life, 15000 cycles cold parts, 7500 cycles turbine b lades  Greater than or equal to 35% Reduction in maintenance cost relative to contractor proposed and Government accepted baseline  Greater than or equal to 10% Reduction in development cost relative to contractor proposed and Government accepted baseline  Notes:  The above engine goals are based on a configuration that does not include reduction gearbox or inlet particle separator.  Engine test configuration can use slave reduction gearbox (6000 rpm gearbox design only required  no fabrication and test of  6000 rpm reduction gearbox necessary).  Engine configuration includes free shaft Efficient operation at part power and variable power turbine speeds (50-100%) is highly desirable.  The ability to operate effectively at various altitude and temperature conditions up to 35,000 feet altitude is desirable.  For the purposes of this solicitation, an assumed production rate of 100 engines per year should be used.  The  offeror should provide discussion and substantiation of the goal capability of their selected engine configuration.  DELIVERABLES:   Delivery of the following data items are required: (1) Management/Program Plan, (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Tes t Plans, (4) Test Reports, (5) Quarterly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (6) Final Report, (7) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis    (Note:  Each of these items shall be in the Contractors format)  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  All work performed will be uncl assified and will not require access to classified material.  A determination has been made that performance under the award will require access to and or generate technical data for which the export will be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title  22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 et. seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award the successful firm(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be r equested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084, telephone 1-800-352-3572.  ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is forty-six (46) months total (43 technical perfo rmance and an additional three (3) months for completion of the Draft/Final Report.  EXPECTED AWARD DATE:  November, 2003.  GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE:  Funding planned = $26,000,000  (Distribution: FY04; 22%, FY05; 24%, FY06;26%, FY07;28%).  Also, due to commerc ial application of this engine development effort, up to a 50% cost share is anticipated.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY:  No Government Furnished Property is anticipated under this announcement and if it is necessary it shall be detailed in the proposal.  TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL VEHICLE: A range of funding instruments are available including Technology Investment Agreement (10 USC 2358 OR 10USC 2371) and FAR-based Contracts.  Type of contractual instrument is a subject of negotiation.  Appropriate clauses, ter ms, and conditions will be incorporated upon award.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, only a portion of an offeror's proposal (i.e. certain tasks vs total program), or none of the proposals received.  Multiple awards ma y be possible depending upon cost share; however, the funding available is expected to fund no more than one full program and one partial program (i.e. certain tasks vs. total program).  Agreements with cost participation by the Recipient of up to 50% are anticipated for each award made because the technology has high dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost sharing and matching requir ement are addressed in Sec 34.13 of the Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoD 3210.6R).

This statement of work is for the requirement to remediate water contaminated with TRPH and grease, which is collected in oil/water separators, holding tanks, grease traps, and waste water collection piping transferring contaminated water from its sources to wastewater treatment facilities.  This shall be done with the use of microbes that will reduce the contaminates and the preventive maintenance activity.  The product will be the latest generation of microbial bacteria identified as 637-HC and 327-GT: not to compare to less effective enzyme process.  This work specification establishes the minimum requirements to provide bio-remediation services to treat water contamination of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) in oil water separators and grease in grease traps Luke AFB, AZ.  There are three general sources for the contaminates to enter the oil/water separators/traps: sinks, paved surfaces such as the aircraft ramp with associated aprons and roads, and drains and food preparation facilities.  The objective is two fold.  First reduce the contamination to below Environmental Protection Agency standard 418.1 at the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant by commencing and sustain the cleaning process from the source throughout the system.  Second, obviate the need to periodically contract removal of oil contaminates from the oil water separators, holding tanks and grease removal from traps for disposal at authorized landfills or processing facilities.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment; tools, materials, supervision and services necessary to treat contaminated wastewater.  Reducing the TRPH count to less than 100 parts per million (PPM), phenol compounds to less than 5 parts per billion (PPB).

Contractor will install peristaltic pumps at 32 locations (22 for TRPH and 10 grease), and 16 (TRPH) manually fed locations where contaminates originate.  The pumps/time dissolve cakes will introduce bacteria to the drain lines carrying the contaminates to the separators/traps.  These process and digest contaminates adhering to the surface drain lines as well as those TRPH contaminates in the separators or grease in traps.  A container filled with 327-HC/327-GT hydrocarbon will be installed with a battery-operated pump under a sink, near a drain.  For those sites where a sink is not available, the contractor will construct a unit to provide a complete enclosure.  No visible openings for equipment and products, and install it next to site where bacteria will be added.  The pump is designed to release a predetermined amount daily.  Contractor personnel will schedule replenishment of the container to ensure uninterrupted insertion of microbes to drain lines.  Contractor must provide a complete enclosure shelter with no visible openings for all equipment that is not located inside of a facility.  The contractor guarantees the bio-remediation process will successfully accomplish the objectives within the stated parameters.  The contractor reserves the option to introduce alternate methods for treatment to enhance the process.  The contractor will evaluate all grease traps to determine if they require pumping, then report locations that require pumping to necessary personnel.  The contractor will have an Arizona certified analytical laboratory, perform quarterly tests for Phenols and TRPH after oil water separator #912 and before treatment at wastewater treatment plants to ensure meeting or less than stated limits.  The contractor will perform all services in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.	Design a stand in two sections to fit around the vertical stabilizer of an F-16 aircraft. The stands will be used by structural maintenance personnel to aid in painting the aircraft.

2.	With the exception of fastening hardware and work platform decking, the stands need to be constructed entirely of aluminum.  Structural members, guardrails, and handrails are 2-inch OD 6063-T832 or 6061-T6 tubing, the stair treads are 5052 aluminum; all castings are 356-T6 aluminum.  No plastic, fiberglass, or composite materials are used in the work stand structure.  The platforms are fabricated using an aluminum structural support frame and decked with 1/ 2 inch plywood.  Corrugated sheet aluminum covers the plywood for added durability and slip resistance.

3.	The majority of the structural subassemblies comprising the work stand are fabricated where by the tubing is cold formed (swaged) to the joint castings.  Welds on the work stand are in accordance with American Welding Standard D1.2 and are accomplished by welders certified to the specification.

4.	Assembly of the work stand can be accomplished without the use of cranes, forklifts, or any special tools; to include no major onsite fabrication (drilling, cutting, welding, etc.).  Structural frames and guardrails utilize a snap hook method (cast aluminum hook with a spring pin); frames are connected using horizontal and diagonal braces.  Maintainers must be able to disassemble the stand for repairs if needed.  Access to and egress from the work stands is by means of a stairway.

5.	Positioning of the work stands around the aircraft easily and safely accomplished by 2 to 3 people. The work stands need to have casters with polyurethane wheels.  Casters roll and swivel in the unlocked position and have a foot operated brake which will reduce the caster offset to zero and brake the wheel.

6.	ASM request the work stands assembled onsite and element personnel trained in any maintenance required in stand operations.  Also that the stands be warranted.

7.	When assembled, the dimensions of the work stands are as follows:
		Width: approximately 81 inches, not including stairway
		Length: approximately 120 inches
		Platform heights: 8 foot - 8 inches and 12 foot - 4 inches
		Platform height adjustment: 12 inches by adjustable threaded leg and leg lock
		Guardrails: 42 inches in height above the platform surface

8.	The work stands are designed and constructed in accordance with applicable AFOSH,  OSHA, and ANSI standards.  Work stands are based on a unit platform loading of 25 pounds per square foot with a safety factor of 4.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE!!!!

This is a synopsis for a commercial acquisition (Reference FAR Parts 12 and 13.5) to develop a PC and/or SUN Ultra 10 compatible, user-friendly, fast-running version of a modern HEMP (High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse) code.   This requires the contractor to develop and deliver a modified HEMP code that provides a simplified user interface for data input/output, reduces problem execution time to minutes rather than hours, extends the range of HEMP model applicability to low altitude and provide for upward direction of signal propagation (relevant to satellite detection of NUDET EMP signals).  The government intends to award on a sole source basis to Metatech Corporation.  Metatech is the only source capable of fulfilling the governments requirement because it is the only organization in the United States with full EMP computational capability and employs key individuals who developed the original EMP codes.  In addition, Metatech has already developed a proprietary state-of-the-art EMP code that can be used as the baseline modeling code for this requirement.  The Solicitation No. F08650-03-T-0128 is issued as a Request for Quotation.  This proposed procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  It is advertised with a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 7371, and a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541512.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 29 Apr 03. The solicitation will not be posted electronically, but this office will provide a copy to any firm requesting one.  Anticipated award date will be on or around 2 May 03.  Point of contact is Lt Scott Norman, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H.

<DESC>6.3 Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA)

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Ordnance Integration Branch (AFRL/MNMI) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development and demonstration of an Agent Defeat Munition from firms interested in development of munition systems.  Current inventory hard target penetrators are designed to deliver and detonate a high explosive payload within the interior of hardened structures, such that maximum damage is inflicted on the target structure and its contents.  However, this approach against fixed hardened targets associated with the development, production, and storage of chemical (C) agents, biological (B) agents, and CB weapons (CBW) is not desired because of the release of the agents into the atmosphere, which contributes to collateral damage.  A number of studies have shown the need for a penetrating weapon that is capable of delivering an alternative payload within a hardened structure in a manner that minimizes blast overpressure while inflicting damage to the target contents and limiting collateral damage.  The primary goal of the baseline 24-month Shredder Program is to develop and demonstrate a penetrating warhead (BLU 109) with a payload consisting of White Phosphorous and High Explosive (PBXN 109) for use against these fixed hardened targets.  An IDIQ contract type will provide for a 60-month total ordering period and the ability to vary the payload and/or quantities in future Task Orders should additional funds become available.  Please refer to attachments posted at  this site for detailed Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) information.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate with and issue a sole source follow-on to an existing contract to Family Health International (FHI)  N01-HFD-0-3301.  The follow-on is to extend the observation period of a prospective study of the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition through heterosexual intercourse. This international study includes long-term follow-up of women who are currently seronegative for HIV, but who live in regions with a high incidence of acquisition of HIV.  The study includes research to define the role of hormones on associated factors that may affect HIV acquisition or transmission, such as bacterial vaginosis, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and genital HIV shedding.  The academic/international HIV/contraceptive research infrastructure already in place at FHI, under the established contract, makes a competitive offering of this project not feasible.  This action is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  See numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is seeking Offerors who have the capability to test approximately fifty (50) chemicals per year  up to ten (10) years for somatic cell genetic effects in animals, usually rats and/or mice.  Endpoints which will be assessed include:
Task 1 - Micronuclei in bone marrow and/or other tissues (e.g. lung, spleen, peripheral lymphocytes).  Animals will be treated in the contract laboratory for these studies.
Task 2 - Micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes from sub-chronic studies.  Animals will be treated in other laboratories and cells shipped to the contract laboratory for micronucleus scoring.
Task 3 - Centromeric probe analysis of micronuclei
Task 4 - Single cell gel electrophoresis assays of various tissues
Task 5 - Analysis of genetic toxicity information.  

New technology has automated the process of counting the number of micronuclei cells on slides and therefore a Flow Cytometer is required of the Offeror to perform this project.

The Government estimates that Tasks one (1) to four (4) will require approximately six (6) to seven (7) person-years per year.  Task five (5)  will require one (1) person-year per year and this position is will be on site at the NIEHS and office space, equipment, and materials will be provided by the government. The period of performance will be ten (10) years.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 and the small size standard is 500 employees or less.  See numbered Notes 1 and 26.

Each facility is supported by dedicated Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) providing 12 to 15 minutes of emergency power, which allows for an ordered shutdown of system in case of a total power failure.  Each facility (i.e, Data Center) has its own hours of operation and staffing requirements. Lead Operators are on call, on a rotating basis, 
365 days/year, 24 hours/day.  The period of performance for this effort is three (3) years with two additional one-year options.  This proposed procurement is a commercial item and is a 100 percent small business set-aside.  The size standard for this requirement is average annual receipts of $21.0 million over the past three fiscal years as set forth under NAICS 541513.  Interested firms should submit written requests for a copy of the solicitation to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the address as shown below.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Closing date for proposals is estimated at two (2) weeks after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: John Rowlands, Managing Director, Expectra 685 Agency (Pty) Ltd., 2 Ninth Avenue, Highlands North Ext, Johannesburg  2192, South Africa, Phone: +27 (11) 885-2236, Fax:     +27 (11) 885-2236  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an instant dry yeast (IDY) manufacturing facility in South Africa.   

Founded in 2002, Expectra 685 is a South African private company whose principal activity is to promote new investments in areas where production facilities in Southern Africa could be internationally competitive.  Other projects include investments in a mineral-based chemical company and in the waste management of environmentally hazardous mineral byproducts.

Expectra 685 seeks a U.S. company to carry out a feasibility study for a dry yeast manufacturing project in South Africa.  The project focuses on the manufacture of bakers yeast, in the commercial form of IDY. The proposed manufacturing facility would utilize molasses from South Africas sugar refineries.  Because of the transport-ability of the final product, manufacturing might be co-located with an existing sugar refinery in a rural area.  The feasibility study will examine the economic, financial, and technical feasibility of this project, and will include an implementation plan for the project sponsor (Expectra 685).  

Components of the study include:
1.	Economic Analysis
a.  International industry analysis	
b.  Market demand analysis 
c.  Competitive analysis:  
d.  Equity sponsor analysis
e.  Project company analysis
2.	Financial Analysis
a.	Updated financial model
b.	Sensitivity analysis of the model
c.	Appropriate financial structure and products
d.	Due diligence (risks and mitigants) analysis 
3.	Technical Analysis
4.	Preliminary Environmental Analysis
5.	Development Impact Analysis (for the South African Government)
6.	Identify U.S. Equipment and Services
7.	Implementation Plan
8.   Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $243,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 PM, local time on June 16, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Superintendent, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, announced today its tentative decision to outsource to private industry the Base Operating and Other Services for USNA. This decision is a result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. There were approximately 331 military and civilian personnel performing the functions under the study. The decision to outsource the performance of the functions to private industry was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to perform the functions by contract rather than by retaining performance in-house. A 30 day appeal period commences on the date of announcement, Friday May 2, 2003 through close of business Friday June 1, 2003. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to the Commanding Officer, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake, 1314 Harwood Street, SE, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20374-5018, to the attention of both: Danny Stubbs and Jeff Cornell.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is as follows:

The proposal due date is extended from May 07, 2003 to May 09, 2003 no later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

On May 05, 2003 there will be a site visit at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The locations are as follows: SA-1 Columiba Plaza, 2401 E Street, NW, Washington, DC. Enter at the 2nd Floor security entrance and contact Cecil Grandy at (202) 663-1775.
This will be the first location for the site visit.  

Pomponio Plaza East,1800 No. Kent Street,Arlington, VA 22209, Will meet in the lobby and contact Derek Cato at (202) 369-8473. This will be the last location of the site visit.

There is a limit of two (2) employees per vendor. 

Additional questions are due no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday, May 05, 2003. 	

Provided below are the Questions & Answers for S-LMAQM-03-R-0084 that were received before May 02, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. deadline.

1. Please confirm the maximum height for the new units so not to interfere with mechanical infrastructure in the ceiling?

Answer: 109 is the maximum height

2. Please confirm that self-clearance of existing Lektrievers or 10.5 high plus is acceptable?

 Answer: Shelf clearance, units must allow sufficient headroom for files and out-guides of at least 10.5.  

3. A 10.5 clearance for headroom of files and out-guides is requested.  The clearance in the existing 16 machines is 9.92.  Will there be a change in the size of the folder or out-guide presently used?  If so, they will not fit into the existing machines.  Please clarify.

Answer: No the size of the out-guides are 10.5 and the medical folders are 9.5

4. Will a shift of the records be necessary to distribute all files into the existing and new machines to rebalance all units?

Answer: Yes, a shift in the records will be required in all units.

5. Are all vertical carousels filled to capacity?

Answer: No

6. How often are the files accessed daily and at what time of the day?

Answer: Files are accessed throughout the day from 8:15 am  5:00 p.m.

7. Will new units be installed before existing units are moved?

Answer: Yes

8. Will all records need to be accessed during move?  Can records be moved as the Lektrievers are moved?

Answer:  Yes, the records will be moved to the new location after re-installment.

9. How far away is the elevator in relation to where carousels are currently located?

Answer: Approximately 60 ft. and the loading dock are on Floor 1.  Please note a site visit is scheduled for May 5, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. at SA-1.

10. Does Section 508 apply?

Answer: The Americans with Disabilities Act does not apply to the United States Government in this case.  The application of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to lektriever-type filing systems deals with products that are clearly EIT (electronic information technology) that automatically manipulate, display or store electronic data, which cabinets for the storage of paper documents plainly do not.

11. Is this a GSA or Open Market Solicitation?

Answer: Open Market

12. Is there access to an elevator in the garage at SA-15?

Answer: No

13. How many filing clerks will be present during the move?

Answer: 3 filing clerks will be the maximum present at one time.

14. How many members of the vendor crew will be allowed on site during the relocation at any one time?

Answer: This will need to be determined.  Possibly 4 workers

15. Will work be completed during normal working hours?

Answer:   Yes, however, we would like to see the cost of completing this work on the 2nd shift/weekend as well as the turnaround time to dismantle and re-install multiple machines at one time.

16. Will work be completed when filing clerks are at work?

Answer:  Yes

17. Please provide the dimensions of the floor space?

Answer:  Will answer during site visit on Monday, May 5th 2003

18. Will there be a site visit?

Answer: Yes, May 5, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. at SA-1.

19. Please confirm that any new equipment should accept existing letter trays interchangeably?

Answer:  This will be addressed at the next Q & A posting.

20. How much staging area is there at both facilities?

Answer:  Not able to determine at this time.  Will discuss further during site visit.

21. Are there any safety courses or indoctrinations needed during the course of the work that we would have to account man hours to perform training?

Answer: None that we are aware of.

22. Can we also have drawings of specifically what area has been laid out in the new facility for the existing Lektrievers and the New Units?

Answer:  This will addressed at site visit.

23. Lektriever can be used as a generic name for a vertical filing system so we
would need to know who the manufacturer is of the units and what the model
numbers are.  In the event that the model number is not available, please
provide the height, width, depth and the number of pans of the units
required for relocation.

Answer: Kardex, Model LK-S8OM, 14 rows, 7 drawers

24. We will also need to know how old the existing units are and if there is a
current contract for regular preventive maintenance services and if so, who
performs these services.  If it is not a reputable company there is a
possibility that the maintenance performed is not sufficient to maintain the
machines and the machines may not be in good working condition which could
lead to problems during the relocation.  Prior to relocation, there would
need to be a sufficient inspection of the units to determine any repairs and
component replacements that need to be performed.

Answer:  Remco Business Systems, INC.

<DESC>Lake Tahoe is designated as one this countrys outstanding water resources. A large and deep lake nestled against the crest of the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe has long been famous for its clarity; in 1871 Mark Twain described the clarity as not being merely transparent but dazzlingly brilliantly so. Unfortunately at the present time, clarity is declining at a rate of nearly one foot per year. Many years of scientific research have determined that lake clarity is linked to historic and current land use that impacts natural processes: these do not only affect Tahoes clarity, but have reduced the overall health of ecosystems throughout the basin. The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) of the USDA Forest Service is responsible for managing 77 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe basin. The LTBMU is responsible for restoring natural processes that sustain healthy ecosystems on these lands. The LTBMU believes that restoration of natural processes will lead to healthier functioning ecosystems that will improve the clarity of Lake Tahoe. 
Big Meadow Creek is a tributary watershed of the Upper Truckee River. It has a long history of land use and impacts from humans. The Forest Service believes that the cumulative affects of land use are negatively impacting ecosystem processes in this watershed. A comprehensive ecosystem analysis is needed to understand those impacts.  Assessment findings will be used to develop a long-range restoration plan for the Big Meadow Creek watershed.  


The LTBMU is seeking SF-254s and SF-255s from qualified consultants to provide professional services for a comprehensive ecosystem assessment and long-range restoration plan for the Big Meadow Creek Watershed. 
PROJECT SITE DESCRIPTION
Big Meadow creek  is 5.5 square mile triangular-shaped watershed.  Elevation in the Big Meadow Creek drainage ranges from 6500, to over 9000, feet. The underlying bedrock is granodiorite of Sierra Nevada Batholith. Tertiary volcanic rocks cap the southwestern quadrant. The longitudinal profile of the watershed is stair-stepped, a pattern typical of glaciated headwater basins in the Sierra Nevada. Meadows have formed along low gradient treads. The vegetation is typical of that found in upper montane and sub alpine watersheds in the central Sierra Nevada. The project is located in El Dorado County and is accessible from US Highway 89 south of the City of South Lake Tahoe.



The main components of this project are: 1. GEOMORPHOLOGY  AND HYDROLOGY -
watershed morphological characteristics created by climate, glaciation, faulting, landslides, land management etc. that impose physical controls on the geomorphic function of the ecosystem  - Time series aerial photo analysis of watershed changes from 1939 to present -  Description of the fluvial geomorphic systems dynamic stability
under the current climatic regime (i.e. the range of inherent variability in channel dimension, pattern, and profile under the full range of discharges, description of current sediment and nutrient transport dynamics, etc.)
  Description of the hill slope geomorphic systems dynamic stability under the     current climatic regime (the range of inherent variability in erosion potential and sediment production during climatic events typical for this environment)
Determine the influence of groundwater and surface flow on hillslope and stream environment zone (SEZ) function

<SUBJECT>D -- Data set Topgraphic surveys New Orleans
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures are applicable. FTS intends to award a firm, fixed-price purchase order with an estimated value of less than $50,000.00 to Tobin International, LTD, PO Box 708902, San Antonio, TX 78270-8902, 210-223-6203. The data set provided will contain essentially five components (specifically for Plaquemine's Parish Louisiana):
(1) Public Land Survey System (PLSS) polygons of township, range, and section compiled from
latitude/longitude coordinate system and the US Geological Survey topographic maps.
(2) Plaquemine's Parish certified political boundary.
(3) Property Ownership boundaries precisely fitted to the PLSS and other data sets.
(4) Oil and Gas Lease boundaries precisely fitted to the PLSS and other data sets.
(5) Oil and Gas Wells containing API number, operator name, lease name, well number, 
total depth, and status. 
All layers are integrated to match spatially and are topologically correct.
The USACE New Orleans District uses these data sets for many tasks.  "Right-of-Entry" is required in order to perform topographic surveys on private lands.  Additionally, ownership boundaries and attributes enable the USACE New Orleans District to overlay project features and immediately correlate the location project impacts to private land owners, as well as oil and gas entities.  Oil and gas lease boundaries and well data are vital in regards to pipelines in the project study area.  These data sets will be used in support of any Hazardous and Toxic Waste Removal (HTRW) efforts.  The data sets are also very valuable for the USACE New Orleans District's Emergency Response team and their efforts.
This acquisition is unrestricted. The NAICS code is 541360. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. There are no solicitation documents. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>76 -- Patent Data Capture
<DESC>United States Patent and Trademark Office, Mail Stop 6 - Office of Procurement, Director of the US Patent and Trademark Office, PO Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450

76PATENT DATA CAPTURE CONTRACT EXTENSION and IMAGE FILE WRAPPER (ePHOENIX) REQUIREMENT, POC/Contracting Officer, Mr. Page A. Etzel.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to extend the current patent data capture (PaDaCap) contract period of performance which is due to expire on December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 under Contract No. 50-PAPT-8-00007 with Reed Technology and Information Services, Inc. (RTIS).  

The USPTO, Office of Patent Publication (PUBS), through its patent data capture contractor is presently responsible for patent content data capture services and publication of paper and electronic products used to disseminate patent information worldwide.  PUBS is also responsible for data capture and publication of Pre-Grant Publications (PG Pub) products.  In late 2002, USPTO announced an agreement between the agency and the European Patent Office (EPO) to adapt and implement ePhoenix, the image and retrieval software in use by the EPO, for the Image File Wrapper (IFW) of U.S. patent applications. As a result, it has become necessary to significantly change the patent data capturing processes. 

Prior to the announcement of these significant operational changes, the USPTO was in the process of preparing for the recompetition of the patent data capture contract which is presently scheduled to end on December 31, 2003.  These new changes and the pending implementation of IFW (ePhoenix) at the USPTO have prevented the agency from developing a comprehensive statement of work which will adequately describe the changing patent data capture services and fully define USPTO requirements for the next five years. It has therefore become necessary to extend the present contract for a one-year period while maintaining a seamless transition to a fully operational IFW (ePhoenix) system.

It is anticipated that the current work provided by the incumbent contractor will be greatly affected by the USPTOs transition to electronic examination and processing of patent applications via IFW (ePhoenix).  According to the USPTOs 21st Century Strategic Plan, the paper and electronic process changes must be fully implemented by October 2004.

The current contract ends on December 31, 2003.  In order to successfully meet the deadlines as outlined in the USPTOs 21st Century Strategic Plan without an interruption in patent data capture services, the USPTO must continue to use the incumbent contractor while it completes a comprehensive statement of work which will incorporate the new patent data capture requirements.  At this time, RTIS is the only company with the available specialized resources who possesses the necessary knowledge of current operating procedures and systems to meet the highly complex and new IFW (ePhoenix) requirements while simultaneously continuing the current patent data capture services.  A new contractor would be required to develop the necessary systems and processes for the start-up of two different patent data capture operations.  In addition, as actual contract performance would require a six-month transition period, it has been determined that it would not be economically viable for a contractor, other than the incumbent, to assume both operations for a relatively short period of time.  A one-year extension of the current RTIS contract through December 31, 2004, will enable the USPTO to have a seamless transition to the IFW (ePhoenix).

Delaying the new contract starting period by one year will also greatly maximize competition. Due to the significant start-up costs associated with the data capture operations, a one-year requirement would result in a short term gain thereby limiting competition at this juncture of the procurement process.  It is anticipated that by 2005, the IFW (ePhoenix) will be fully implemented; the governments requirements fully defined; and the new follow-on contractor would only have to meet the requirements of the new electronic process.

This proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  At this time, RTIS is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the continued uninterrupted critical support under the patent data capture contract.  Any award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  This is NOT a formal solicitation; however, individuals interested in the future patent data capture 2 (PaDaCap2) contract solicitation may state their interest by contacting the USPTO Procurement website at:  http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.  Written correspondence shall be directed to:

Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<OFFADD>Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), Office of Procurement, Box 6, Washington, DC, 20231
<SUBJECT>D -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCT ASSURANCE
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is presently in its last year of a five year contract (currently expiring on December 31, 2003) to Galaxy Scientific for the Information Technology Product Assurance (ITPA) services covering Quality Assurance (QA), Configuration Management (CM), Requirements Management (RM), and Independent Testing of USPTO Automated Information Systems and for Data and Records Management.   The ITPA contract provides critical product assurance support to the USPTO/CIO during the entire lifecycle of each AIS project, from project initiation through the delivery of the capabilities into production. 

The following narrative accurately describes the Government's minimum needs and rationale justifying a six-month contract extension to contract number 50-PBPT-9-00001 with Galaxy Scientific Corporation (Galaxy), (through June 30, 2004).  This extension is required to accommodate the need for product assurance support before deployment of several major AIS initiatives.   These initiatives, which are currently underway, include the implementation of new requirements for e-government, mandated in USPTO's 21st Century Strategic Plan, and the migration of the entire USPTO user community to a new operating system.  The initiatives are scheduled for product assurance support during the 3rd quarter of FY 03 and in the 1st quarter of FY 04.   


The projects supporting the key business and AIS initiatives cited above are on an aggressive timetable.  The projects' ability to meet schedule commitments and minimize risks of disruption to the USPTO mission is dependent upon sustained, uninterrupted, and consistent support from the ITPA contractor.  It is not possible for the CIO to plan for and transition the ITPA support functions while simultaneously providing the level of ITPA support needed to ensure the timely, reliable implementation of these critical system initiatives.  The confidence that our systems will adequately support USPTO requirements is based on consistent and sustained ITPA support.
 

The USPTO has determined that there is only one responsible source available [i.e., the ITPA contractor, Galaxy Scientific] at this time.  Continued contract performance by Galaxy for QA, CM, RM, and independent testing support is imperative to the Government; in order to meet the major mandatory changes including the new requirements of electronic patent examination and processing via the use of ePhoenix and the requirements for electronic trademark processing.  The estimated cost of this contract extension is $4,200,000.00 for the period January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2002.   The support areas on the current ITPA contract  for Data and Records Management are being competitively solicited separately and are not part of this six-month extension.
