<SOLNBR>101817Q145
<RESPDATE>020607
<ARCHDATE>01252008
<CONTACT>Frank Lee Contracting Officer 5038722788     frank_lee@fws.gov;
<DESC>The principal goal of this project is to provide accurate tourist survey data to support an on-going effort to revise and produce a more accurate assessment of the economic impact of the introduced brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis, BTS) on Guam.   Specific survey data is needed for a revised input-output model (IO model) that will be used to predict potential impacts of brown treesnake establishment, if it ever occurs, on the economy of the State of Hawaii.  The model currently has a revised estimate of the economic impact of brown treesnakes on Guam's electrical distribution system and human health costs.  More accurate data is needed to: 1) assess the economic impact that the brown treesnake currently has on the tourist industry on Guam and 2) evaluate the potential impact that the establishment of brown treesnakes (or snakes in general) might have on Hawaii's tourist industry.   There are two secondary goals of this project: 1) providing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands with an assessment of the potential impact that the establishment of the brown treesnake would have on their tourist industry and 2) providing an accurate assessment of the current of the impact of brown treesnake presence to interested parties within the Government of Guam. Project goals are to: 1) determine weights for the major market areas impacted, 2) identify the major visitor activities impacted, and 3) assess the impact of snake presence on visitor choice of tourist destination.  Tourist surveys should be conducted with the appropriate sample size to determine tourist opinion within a 10% margin of error for countries or areas of tourist origin that compose greater than 10% of the tourist market arriving in Hawaii, Guam, and the CNMI, respectively - individually.  Examples of countries or areas of tourist origin would be: 1) America / U.S. Mainland; 2) Japan; 3) Korea; and 4) Chinese arrivals combined (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan).   V. Deliverable Products 1) Standardized survey questions that will be reviewed by FWS staff and specific cooperators.  2) A finalized report summarizing survey results

<DESC>This announcement advises that on January 24, 2007, three prime vendors responded to FAA's ADS-B Screening Information Request(SIR) of November 30, 2006.  The prime vendors in alphabetical order are:  1) ITT; 2) Lockheed Martin; and 3) Raytheon. The SIR was designed to determine which vendors or vendor teams understand the ADS-B requirements well enough to proceed in the acquisition process.  An approach to a sample coverage volume was required as part of the response.    Based on the SIR evaluation, FAA program officials plan to announce in February those who appear most likely to win the service contract.  In March, the FAA expects to release a Request for Offer (RFO) to those companies selected from the SIR evaluation. Among other areas, offers will be evaluated based on how vendors or vendor teams expect to implement ADS-B broadcast services and their plans to roll out services into the national airspace system. The awarded contract will be performance based which provides incentives for vendor innovation and alternative business opportunities.   The FAA has posted numerous public announcements and has sponsored several industry days regarding the ADS-B program.  The public announcements may be accessed on the FAA website at:  http://www.faa.gov   about FAA  contract opportunities  current announcements  by keyword (ADS-B)  include archives.  Information related to ADS-B industry days may be viewed at:  http://www.ads-b.gov  or http://www.adsb.gov.    The participation and interest of industry in the ADS-B events is appreciated.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) intends to award a sole source procurement by February 15, 2007 for Database Consulting Services for Sybase to Gotham Consulting Services, Inc. located in Gansevoort, New York.  NASS first utilized database consulting services for Sybase in 1997 when the Agency implemented the Enhanced List Maintenance Operations (ELMO) database on the IBM platform under AIX.  This was the first use of relational databases in NASS and the database server was Sybase.  The services were very beneficial in helping NASS size and configure the database resources.  NASS needed expertise in both data placement and storage options to optimize the Sybase databases. Gotham Consulting Services, Inc was instrumental in setting database configuration parameters for CPU and memory utilization.  This included SQL Server configuration, device setup, memory allocation and utilization, and locking/blocking issues.  The consulting included knowledge transfer to help the administrators and developers gain an understanding of the ELMO application and its performance, implementation and design.  Gotham is the only firm capable of doing this work, which requires a synthesis of every component of the NASS EA- an exceptional skill that has taken years to develop.

<DESC>CoeurdAlene River Ranger District, Kootenai and Shoshone Counties, Idaho.  This project is for the opening of forest roads by removing snow, removing and reinstalling earthen barriers for spring tree planting on the Coeur d Alene River Ranger District on the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. However all units may not be plowed into depending on weather, a pre-observation will determine which roads are to be plowed. The use of a crawler tractor, D-6 Cat, JD 850 or Intl TD 15, is standard industry practice.  Also, a rubber-tired blade is preferred for plowing on asphalt.  Equipment furnished must be fully equipped to include all operating supplies, and must be provided with a skilled operator.  Generally, the equipment should meet the following specifications: 140-160 flywheel horsepower minimum, Rollover protection (ROPS), back up warning device, hydraulic angle blade, 10? minimum length (preferred), ice grousers (preferred).
Four to six inches of snow is to be left to protect road surfaces.  Drain holes shall be installed approximately every 150 feet, as needed.  Turnarounds will be plowed out at the end of the road.  Turnouts will be plowed out every two miles.  The number of moves and miles to plow will depend on weather, actual snowmelt and road conditions, and may vary from map layout.  All earth barriers removed during plowing will be replaced to correct specifications by using a backhoe after tree planting has been completed in that work area.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to develop and specify the cryoinsulation material and friction stir welding technique that will be used to manufacture the Crew Launch Vehicle Upper Stage, a component of the Constellation Program. NASA/MSFC intends to acquire these services non-competitively from Lockheed Martin Corporation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to provide the required support to Constellation while minimizing the risk to the completion of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) by 2010, as well as the risk of impacting the early Constellation Test Flight Program.  There will be a strong commonality of operations and hardware between the SSP and Constellation since Constellation has made the decision to use shuttle-derived technology and existing shuttle facilities capability in its program.  As the External Tank prime contractor, Lockheed Martin operates the Thermal Protection System (TPS) processing capability at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).  MSFC plans to utilize the existing hardware and facilities to further its understanding and experience with third generation TPS foams in order to comply with Environmental Protection Agency regulations that require an eventual phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-based materials.	Lockheed Martins support of the SSP in the areas of cryoinsulation material and friction stir weld will permit timely execution of significant tasks that are a prerequisite for achieving Upper Stage milestones, and prevent schedule conflicts with ongoing SSP tasks.  2.  If another contractor were selected, significant set-up time and training would be required to ensure that the new contractors proficiency levels on the tools and equipment at MSFC would be equal to the levels currently offered by Lockheed Martin.  Further, the time necessary to train another contractors personnel would result in a negative schedule impact of six months, adding additional cost and risk to the Government by not supporting the scheduled material downselect timeframe objective.   3.  It is clearly in the publics interest to ensure that sufficient skilled resources are available to safely, timely, and successfully complete SSP, assemble the International Space Station, and transition over to the new Constellation Program.  The Associate Administrators of Space Operations Mission Directorate and Exploration Systems Mission Directorate believe that to meet the concurrent challenges of flying out Shuttle safely while meeting the Constellation development goals, the Agency should maximize the use of existing resources until new capabilities and contract vehicles are in place.  They believe there is a significant technical commonality such that existing capabilities can be put to their best use.  They encourage short to mid-term use of NASAs existing SSP contractors uniquely applicable knowledge, capabilities, and ability to schedule and integrate complementary and compatible Shuttle and exploration requirements to the maximum extent practical.  This approach would only be used until such time as appropriate Constellation contracts could be put into place, around 2010. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 9, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center (EMCBC) Office of Contracting, intends to issue a sole source contract to Source One Management, Inc. to continue litigation support services for the Office of Legal Services (OLS)/EMCBC.  The period of performance will include a base period and four (4) option periods.  The services required under this contract are for litigation support services with respect to ongoing litigation, other claims related to the former Rocky Flats facility and other litigation support actions at the direction of the OLS/EMCBC, in addition to administration of the Basis Litigation Imaging System during the required timeframes beginning January 1, 2007. The services required are necessary to support the OLS/EMCBC.  Tasks will consist of providing litigation document production support and basic litigation system administration services to OLS/EMCBC including research, retrieval and document reproduction services to ongoing and future litigations; development and/or maintenance of an automated document management system to track production of litigation and related documents; and system administration, Help Line, User Training and research support for the Basic Litigation Imaging System. It may also include management of the document reproduction process for other government agencies (collection, transport, copying, collation, pagination, mailing and storage) for ongoing litigation and other information requests including FOIA and Privacy Act. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contract is with Source One Management, Inc. and is due to expire on December 31, 2006.  Services need to continue without disruption in order to assure the continuity of ongoing litigation and maintain the qualified and experienced workforce.  Since Source One has provided litigation support throughout case development for complex class actions, they have unique institutional knowledge to support continuing case development and litigation support efforts. Source One also performs these services for existing cases at the Rocky Flats site as a subcontractor for another DOE Office of Legacy Management (LM) contractor.  Therefore, efficiencies exist which would be time and cost prohibitive for another contractor to overcome in order to successfully perform the work. Therefore, this necessitates the award of a sole source contract to the incumbent contractor, Source One Management, Inc.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the necessary and required services from January 1, 2007 for a base period of one (1) year with up to four (4) one-year option periods to be exercised at the Governmentâs discretion.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION FOR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 15 OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested parties believing that they have all of the capabilities described above may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes. The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 45 days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA) for a non-competitive Cost Plus Award Fee modification for the purpose of (1) extending the contract period of performance and (2) increasing the contract value of the DCSG Integration Support Contract (DISC), F19628-01-C-0047, with Verdian Systems .  The current period of performance ends 31 December 2007.  The new period of performance will be 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2008, with one option year 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2009.  The estimated cost of the contract will increase by $24M.  The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contract extension with the incumbent contractor, General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GD-AIS) (Veridian), is for the continuation of critical Systems Engineering, Network Engineering, Configuration and Baseline Management, Process Improvement, and Site Activation operations and capabilities for the AF DCGS Program Office.  This extension is required to ensure seamless systems integration support for the installation and integration of Block 10.2.  Due to circumstances beyond the Government's and the current DISC contractor's control, the Block 10.2 field installation and integration schedule has been delayed, thus requiring an extension to the contract period of performance. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  If a firm believes they are capable of fully satisfying the Government's requirements, they may identify their interest and capability to 950th ELSG/PK, Attn:  Patricia Forest, phone (781) 266-1048 or e-mail pat.forest@hanscom.af.mil.

The Bishop Group, Inc. employees collectively possess nearly 200 years of experience in the acquisition of undersea warfare systems and in developing the plans, identifying applicable technologies, costs and other relevant issues associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and employment of maritime mines.  They are uniquely positioned to support NSWC-PC in producing an effective maritime mining analysis to support the PR-09 Mining Study. Any other company would require significantly more time (estimated at well over 50 percent) to perform this tasking due to the need to establish the contacts within the DoD and Navy that Bishop Group Inc already has es!  tablished.  Therefore, no other company is in the position to provide the required support.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or modified COTS, Oxygen Regulator and Component Test Stand (ORCTS).  The ORCTS will be used to test US Navy aviators oxygen breathing regulators and related oxygen components as well as panel mounted regulators both ashore and onboard L-class ships.  The Oxygen Component Test Stand (OCTS) is the current tester that supports all airframes that utilize oxygen for aviator breathing but utilizes outdated technology (manually controlled), is labor intensive and prone to improper operation and system contamination.   The requirement is to provide a replacement for the ORCTS that has potential for adapting to more complex items and is automated to negate the potential for operator error during testing and ensure that testing is uniform throughout the process.
A firm-fixed price Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated. Award will be based upon best value evaluation criteria and be granted to the small business offeror whose proposal is determined to be most beneficial to the Government.  The base quantity is expected to consist of three (3) pilot production test units to be used for Government and Contractor testing/technical evaluation.  It is anticipated that the base quantity will also consist of engineering and logistics data item deliveries.  Delivery for the pilot production test units will be within six months after contract award and testing/technical evaluation of the pilot production units is anticipated to be completed within 120 days after contract award.  The contract will provide for step-ladder quantity pricing for up 60 production ORCTSs per year over a three year ordering period (FY09, FY10 and FY11) for a total quantity of 180 production ORCTSs.  Delivery of the production units will be at a rate of five units per month.  It is anticipated that deliveries will be f.o.b. origin.  The contract will provide for two option CLINs for logistics support.  Only one of the two options CLINs, if any, will be exercised.  One option CLIN will provide for spare and repair parts required to support the ORCTS for a period of 24 months beginning with the delivery of the first production unit.  The other option CLIN will provide for IPBL support during the initial 24 month ramp-up phase in anticipation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) tasks that would be required during the performance of a potential follow-on PBL contract.  This optional IPBL support during the ramp-up phase will involve provision of the personnel, services, materials and facilities to plan, implement and execute an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) program for the duration of the contract and any related supplies and services contracts.
The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select Doing Business and then Open Solicitations.  Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 1 April 2007. The Government will not accept electronic offers.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) expects to pursue a follow-on contract to N01-ES-15478 awarded to the University of Washington, and as such is seeking sources capable of performing the requirement briefly described below.  Contract objectives include  1) establish a catalog of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in prioritized environmental response genes (ERGs) based on direct re-sequencing of selected genes; 2) use high-throughput sequencing technologies for rapid sequencing analysis utilizing a national sample repository for analysis of sequence variation in the U.S. population and make this data available to the scientific community via centralized public databases; 3) develop web-based tools to display estimated haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium patterns in human populations using the EGP data sets; 4) evaluate the population distributions of estimated haplotypes and identify evolutionary patterns among the human populations represented in the polymorphism discovery resource samples; and 5) mine the sequence variation in EGP genes to highlight potential functional coding or non-coding variants for further biological testing. Specific performance will involve re-sequencing up to a total of 120 gene equivalents (GE), 30 per year, from genomic DNA obtained from a sample of at least 96 ethnically defined individuals, data entry and validation.

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a demonstration of an energy-efficient secondary loop  HFC-152a mobile air conditioning system.  This demonstration project will accelerate the development and market introduction of the HFC-152a technology that satisfies both the U.S. EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) requirements for safety and the new regulations in the European Union  that will require air conditioning systems using refrigerants with a global warming potential (GWP) of less than 150.  The contractor will be responsible for project plan development, system design, peer review and a baseline performance test of the system.  In addition, the contractor will prepare  a design manual that provides instructions on how to build an energy-efficient secondary-loop HFC-152a system. A determination not to compete this purchase order was made because Delphi Automotive Systems has completed comprehensive proprietary risk analysis, component testing and system design  that is a necessary prerequisite to the current work.  Delphi possesses the test facilities and industry partners that are needed to complete the work.   This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and  concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00035.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 541620; small business size standard $6.5 million.   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human  welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science  Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The  schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for  re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and  sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised  to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the  EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and  integration of the available scientific knowledge base, pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops  website.

A survey and assessment of Rural Telecommunications Development (RTD) initiatives; an initial visit and assessment of the current situation in Afghanistan; a legal/policy/regulatory review; an evaluation of key RTD technological solutions, architectures, and their attendant economics and risks/benefits; an identification of U.S.-based suppliers and development impact assessment; a review and evaluation of RTD business and funding models; the development of recommendations on optimum utilization of TDF; an elaboration of strategies and mechanisms for incentivization of RTD; an in-country presentation and workshop; and the production of draft and final reports.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $404,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Ft. Gordon, GA, US Army Medical Command Southeast Region has a requirement for Stent Systems and other medical supplies. The Government intends to award a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for this requi rement (Note 22), for this requirement.  The suggested contractor is Abbott Laboratories, 3200 Santa Clara, CA,  95054-2807.  The Stent System, as with many other comodities, numerous products will theoretically and technically offer similar or identical l evels of of performance.  It is essential, however, that a physician utilize surgically surgically implanted products with which he/she has the very highest degree of training, experience knowledge and confidence. The high cost of these products makes it b oth fiscally and physically impractical to purchase, maintain and rotate adequate levels of stock.  This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical spec ifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, Restoration Center in partnership with the New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council and Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, is in need of a contractor to complete fish passage improvements, including demolition and restoration activities, along the Acushnet River at the Sawmill and Hamlin Street dams in order to maximize access to riverine and lacustrine spawning habitats for anadromous fish for the Acushnet River Fish Passage Restoration Project in Acushnet, Massachusetts.  The project consists of constructing nature-like fishways at the Sawmill Dam and Hamlin Street Dam.  

The contractor shall construct a flow constrictor/step pool structure below the Sawmill Dam spillway which will extend from the top of the Sawmill Dam spillway for a distance of approximately 200 ft downstream.  In order to ensure that all river flows will be directed to the restored channel, the existing sluiceway shall be permanently closed, thereby directing all flow through the restored channel alignment, both permanently daylighting this reach of the river and eliminating dry, no-flow periods in the restored reach of the river channel.  The flow constrictor/ step pool shall be constructed from carefully placed, large rock boulders.  Imbricated riprap walls shall also be used to stabilize slopes adjacent to the step pool system.  The contractor shall use vegetative plantings to stabilize slopes above flood elevations, along the upper slopes and the tops of banks. The contractor shall also notch the Sawmill Dam spillway and remove a building that straddles the river channel.

At the Hamlin Street Dam site, the contractor shall construct a flow constrictor/ step weir system from carefully placed, large rock boulders that shall be set essentially perpendicular to flow across the streambed at strategic locations.  Imbricated riprap walls shall also be used to stabilize slopes adjacent to the step weir system.  The contractor shall use vegetative plantings to stabilize slopes above flood elevations, along the upper slopes and the tops of banks.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. The purpose is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for the Instruments Commodity Council. The Instrument Commodity Council contemplates negotiating a performance based logistic support services contract to support the repair of the B-1B Flight Controls and CADC.  It is anticipated that this will be a firm fixed price contract based on flying hours. The Government anticipates negotiating on a sole source basis with Honeywell Inc as they have rights to the drawings for the items to be repaired.  This effort is currently being accomplished as organic repair in the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops. Honeywell will be entering into an agreement with the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops to complete the effort. It is anticipated that Honeywell will be providing the total logistics support efforts.

 6610-01-269-5437.        CACD



 This sources sought synopsis is hereby clarified as follows: The noun for NSN 6610-01-269-5437 is CADC not CACD. This effort is to improve material availability, delivery, quality, cost savings and increase reliability of B-1B Flight Control Systems through Performance Based Logistics (PBL). This PBL effort incorporates the Power by the Flight Hour concept whereby the contractor is paid fixed rate per flying hour. A central tenant of PBL is the contractor is responsible for all performance outcomes. The contractor must have the necessary design, manufacturing, production in process data capable to provide the performance outcomes, predetermined levels of availability, reliability increase from technology insertion, engineering for design changes, and technical data revisions for the Honeywell International Incorporated B-1B Flight Control Systems. The essence of this PBL effort is buying performance outcomes, not the individual parts and repair actions. Instead of buying set levels of spares, repairs, tools, and data, the new focus is on buying predetermined levels of availability and increased performance of the B1-B Flight Control System. All touch labor is anticipated to be performed by the OC-ALC Depot with the support described above provided by the contractor. 
Capable sources are requested to submit electronic technical capability statements and relevant information by 17 February 2006 to Phyllis.Schmit@tinker.af.mil

<DESC>Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to recompete its contract for integrating Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) within the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System.  The Contractor selected to fulfill the requirements of this PWS shall be required to operate integrated MASINT capabilities within AF DCGS.  Specifically, the Contractor shall maintain the detailed framework upon which thorough operational planning and system development is accomplished.  The end result is to maintain the established functional/program management, maintain and implement Concepts of Operations (CONOPs)/Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, maintain the TPED capability/capacity commensurate with current and future sensors, and establish a training program.  More specifically the Contractor will focus on AF DCGS capability to handle MASINT tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED).  The AF DCGS is a system of systems architecture composed of fixed and deployable, scalable and modular ISR ground station components that provide multi-source intelligence to the warfighter.  These components are connected via a secure wide area network (WAN) to create a virtual multi-INT tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination (TPED) environment.  The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. The AF DCGS is part of the overall DoD DCGS architecture.  The AF DCGS is worldwide; with core location Distributed Ground Systems (DGSs), remote sites, and the DCGS Processing Exploitation, and Dissemination System (PEDS) Architecture (DPA).  The system simultaneously tasks and receives, processes, exploits and disseminates data from national, theater, tactical, and commercial collection assets in a distributed environment.  It supports national, joint, combined, and AF operations.  It is capable of forward deployed, distributed (split-based), and in-garrison reachback operations.  All services requested under this contract are non-personal in nature.   The anticipated contract award date is Jan 07. The performance period is projected to be a 9 month base period with 4 one year option periods.  If determined in the best interest of government, options will be exercised NLT 1 Oct of each new fiscal year.  A Firm Fixed Price with Cost Reimbursable Line Items is planned.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  This acquisition is unrestricted.

The RFP is planned to be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) world wide web site www.fedbizopps.gov on/or about 25 Sep 06.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered.

<DESC>Our office has been advised that OUSD/DPAP has established a deadline of 31 Jan 2007 for each service to provide a business case to that office justifying the continued use of CFT contracts.  Our office was also asked for some additional information by this deadline.  The information request from OC-ALC has been compiled and is in route back to OUSD/DPAP via the proper command chain.  Once the cases have been received from the services, OUSD/DPAP will review and make a determination on when/if to make a recommendation to OSD/AT&L for final approval.
 
We do not have a timeline/deadline for this next action as of yet.  We will update FBO as we learn more.  It is out hope that a decision will be reached by OSD/AT&L no later than 1 Mar 2007.
 
We thank everyone for their continued interest in the Contract Field Team program.

<DESC>The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the Presidents hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the Pres!  idents initiative by being a first adopter of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE, Hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DODs knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology.

<DESC>The following vendor questions have been received. Answers follow questions. Question: Vendor noticed on the RFQ that the requirements have listed the following: 11 F/O V/A RGB Receiver 160 Mhz, 3 Fiber; 21 F/O Video Transmitter, 160 Mhz, 3 Fiber; 7 External Wall Transformer with LED. Usually the Transmitters and Receivers are an even number to communicate with each other ie 21 transmitters/21 receivers and these are insert cards so are there already existing chassis or maybe desktop enclosures in place. Answer: These are the correct quantities. The unequal numbers reflect spares requirements. The closing date is extended from January 8, 2007 to January 31, 2007. The closing time of 8:00 AM Pacific Time remains unchanged.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. The purpose is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for the Instruments Commodity Council. The Instrument Commodity Council contemplates negotiating a performance based logistic support services contract to support the repair of the B-1B Flight Controls and CADC.  It is anticipated that this will be a firm fixed price contract based on flying hours. The Government anticipates negotiating on a sole source basis with Honeywell Inc as they have rights to the drawings for the items to be repaired.  This effort is currently being accomplished as organic repair in the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops. Honeywell will be entering into an agreement with the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops to complete the effort. It is anticipated that Honeywell will be providing the total logistics support efforts.

<DESC>The HQ 77th Aeronautical Systems Group (77 AESG), seeks sources from industry with the capabilities to design and develop a working model that would process United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) quality source water and produce United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) standard USP 27 quality Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). The model's end process would insert the SWFI into traditional intravenous (IV) plastic bags to makeup IV fluids, such as Lactated Ringer and Normal Saline solutions, for use by AF Medical Service (AFMS) forces administering IV fluids to patients in field medical treatment facilities (MTF). 

The scope of this effort shall be to design and integrate medical grade components into a working model that produces packaged, sterile IV solutions at a rate of 10 to 20 liters per hour. The device should produce packaged IV solutions that comply with USP and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. The model design shall be compact, portable, and automated for use in a deployed field environment. 

The period of performance for this working model effort shall be for approximately six months, culminating in a technical demonstration of the model and a detailed presentation of testing results of the design processes and IV output product. The USAF will reserve the right to conduct independent verification testing of the output products. 

Specifically, this Notice seeks the following information:

-	Whether your company would be willing to propose to a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for the working model effort and a option of System Development Demonstration (SDD) phase; 
-	Description of the capabilities and ability to produce a working model that produces bagged IV fluids such as Lactated Ringers, normal saline, half normal saline, dextrose 5% normal saline (D5NS) that meets USP and FDA standards;
-	Comments on additional technical questions of this Notice;
-	Rough order magnitude (ROM) for providing working model, and  SDD phase;   
-	How your company intends to ensure compatibility with current and future FIVR solutions;       
-	A brief description of your company's business size and business status (ie. small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned, HUBzone, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI);
-	Whether you are interested as a prime or subcontractor and any anticipated teaming arrangements; and
-	For this type of work, whether the FIVR Subcontracting Goals, calculated on the basis of total subcontracting dollars, are realistic or attainable:  

Small Business	24% 
Small Disadvantaged Business	13% 
Woman Owned Small Business	2% 
HUBZone Small Business	1% 
Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business	1% 

If you don't feel the above goals are appropriate, provide achievable goals with your supporting rationale.  This information will be used to establish FIVR Subcontracting Goals in the solicitation when, and if, released.

<DESC>*****THIS IS ONLY A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES THAT CAN PERFORM THIS SERVICE. THERE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT AT THIS TIME, JUST DOING MARKET RESEARCH. *****

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
RELOCATION OF T-1 AIRCRAFT SHELTERS 



2.0. REQUIREMENTS 

2.1.  BASIC SPECIFICATION OF SYSTEM:  The T-1 shelters presently located on east ramp at hangars 5,6 and 7 with the physical locations being rows 8 through 12 are to be rolled as single units and reattached to existing piers at the south end of the east ramp hangars 15 and 16; rows 16 through 20.  Due to high replacement value of these shelters the contractor shall provide the necessary bond coverage for damage/replacement. In addition to the bonding requirement each shelter move shall be regarded as an independent contract; follow on awards will be based on review of structure integrity, placement accuracy and customer satisfaction.       

2.2  DESIGN SPECIFICATION:  The existing T-1 shelters located at rows 8 through 12 shall be relocated one row at a time by lifting/securing and placing a mobile chassis under each shelter structures and moving them to their predetermined new location at rows 16 through 20.  The shelters shall be moved intact with all lights and subcomponents within or on the shelter; note items such as electrical circuit panels, grounding connections, T-1 CASS systems and CASS (4 inch thick) ground slabs will be disconnected and reinstalled by the base IDIQ electrical contractor.  The moving contractor shall be required to provide drawings of the moving chassis and single point tow bridle (which attaches to the tow vehicle and structure/chassis) to CE for review and approval prior to the move.  There will be no welding, flame cutting or fabrication of components on site.  In the event there is an emergency need for welding a bracket the necessary permits shall be approved and obtained from the Base Fire Marshal and Air Field Manager before any action can be taken.  The moving contractor shall be required to lift the 325 ft long by 55 ft wide structure in one simultaneous slow lift with minimal deflection to the structure and roof.  Once the structure is secured and ready to move the old ground attachment points are to be ground smooth to the ramp (below the service).  The contractor shall provide adequate weight bearing cover matting to cross the DV Red Carpet area in the event the shelters should have to travel over it.  As the structure moves down the ramp, the contractor shall have the necessary personnel and tie down equipment to secure the shelter to the ramp in the event an adverse wind situation should arise.  The structure shall be moved in such a manner that the tow speed should be slow enough to prevent any twisting, waiving, or material deflection of the structure.  Upon the arrival of the shelter at its location, the contractor shall be responsible for aligning the shelter with the existing pier locations, ensuring the alignment with the T-38 shelters at the north end of the east ramp, and reattaching it to the ramp.  The contractor shall use the same grade of original manufacturing materials in securing the shelters attachment points.  When the shelter is secured all critical truss, vertical stanchions, horizontal and knee bracing nuts, bolts and washers shall be replaced and re-torque to original manufactures specifications. The entire structure (including, but not limited to bolts, fasteners, and screws) shall withstand wind gust of 120+ mph.   The contractor shall also be responsible for any and all touch up paint associated with the move; all damaged galvanized surfaces will be treated with an approved material like Galv-o-weld.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Multiple Laptop Motherboard Integration
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FRB-HQ-EMH-2007-RFI-0001
<RESPDATE>020907

<DESC>This is for information collection purposes only.

The Continuity Program Office for the Office of the Staff Director for Management (OSDM) is investigating the technical feasibility and practicality of combining separate laptop motherboards into one single case for special-use applications. Laptop motherboards are presumed to be the best available option to meet small size and weight requirements for multiple computer systems. Information will be received electronically to eric.hainzer@frb.gov  before the closing date of February 16, 2007. Office phone is (202) 736-5679


Each laptop motherboard shall have separate R.A.M., hard drive, processor, USB drives, RJ-45/RJ-12 connections, and other common technical features and connections (such as sound card) found in new commercial laptops. The concept is to use standard COTS hardware platforms without any hard design circuitry changes. 

The protective case ?either metal or plastic - shall also have a built-in KVM switch allowing the user to switch between various laptop operating systems using the same monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

Additional unspecified requirements and general thoughts yet to be determined are the following:
1.	The CD/DVD player can be either part of the laptop motherboard or operate as a stand-alone device connected to the KVM switch.

2.	A strong preference is desired for two redundant power supplies that should one fail, the second will operate all systems.

3.	Built-in laptop battery will provide UPS should the AC input fail.

4.	Camera and microphone are preferential options built into the casetop.

5.	Monitor, keyboard, and finger-mouse may be built into the single case similar to most common laptop configurations. The built-in KVM switch will switch between the different motherboard operating systems.

Concerns about compactness, integration, cooling, and replacement of motherboards may make this project price prohibitive. Therefore, this announcement is to understand what capabilities the industry may currently possess and no contract will be awarded based upon this request for information (RFI).

A companys demonstrated history of past performance in similar areas will be of great value in defining future specifications during the course of investigation of this project.

Information will be received electronically to eric.hainzer@frb.gov  before the closing date of February 16, 2007. Office phone is (202) 736-567.

This is for information collection purposes only.

<DESC>The Bureau has acquired new Super Orlof Intaglio printing presses from KBA Giori.  The Super Orlof printing press uses both an indirect and direct inking process for applying ink to the printing plates.  The indirect inking process is similar to the dry offset inking process.  The BEP will use the indirect inking process of the press.  Therefore, the Bureau is conducting a developmental effort with interested intaglio ink suppliers to develop a formulation for both the green and black inks that will optimize the Bureaus print quality and press performance of the Super Orlof Intaglio printing press.  

For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit a 5 pound retain sample of a green intaglio ink and a black intaglio ink with MSDSs for laboratory testing and review.  The VOCs for the inks shall be 12.0 percent or less.  If the retain sample is approved, then the interested ink supplier will be requested to submit approximately 50 pounds for the initial press trial.  Additional quantities of up to 500 pounds of the ink may be requested for a scale up press trial. Ink suppliers may be present during press trials; however, press trials must be scheduled based on the Governments needs and schedules.

Attached is a copy of the current intaglio ink performance specification for the I-10 Intaglio presses.  Interested ink suppliers should use this specification as a general guide for developing intaglio inks for the Super Orlof press.  

The Bureau has an immediate need to identify production green and black intaglio inks for the Super Orlof printing press and as such this announcement will be open until such time as the inks are proven for BEP production use.  Based on this developmental effort and identified ink suppliers capable of producing the inks that meet the Bureaus requirements, a limited competition or a sole source acquisition may result.  

Information shall be submitted to Bureau of Engraving & Printing, Office of Acquisition, Attn:  Jennifer Sellers, Contracting Officer, Manager, Materials and IT Contracts Division, Office of Acquisition, 14th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228.  If you have any questions, please contact Joan Smoot, Contract Specialist on (202) 874-3236, email at joan.smoot@bep.treas.gov or Jennifer Sellers, Contracting Officer on (202) 874-3148, e-mail at jennifer.sellers@bep.treas.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Online Introductory Overview Training for StEPS

I.	Background and Synopsis of Requirement

This is a Request for Information (RFI) regarding a requirement to create online training that provides an introductory overview of the Standard Economics Processing System (StEPS). StEPS is a generalized data processing system which Census Bureau survey analysts primarily use to record, track, review, impute and correct data from economic survey programs. This document defines:

?	Characteristics of the Census Bureau employees and contractor staff who the target audience for this online training;
 
?	Skills/capabilities to be gained from the course;
 
?	Additional course requirements  
                   
II.	Description of StEPS 

StEPS is a generalized data processing system. Quinquennial, annual, quarterly, and monthly Census Bureau economic survey programs collect data from U.S.-based companies. Census Bureau survey analysts primarily use StEPS to record, track, review, impute and correct this data. 

StEPS is run separately for each survey on several server platforms, such as Unix, LINUX, and Blade. Survey specifications, known as ?parameters?, define each survey?s content.  For example, certain parameters define the items on a questionnaire, while others define the characteristics or a record ? such as company name and address.

Data is either hand keyed or imported electronically into StEPS.  The data for each survey within StEPS is stored in a standard SAS data set structure and survey items and variables are then stored as records within the data sets. This allows StEPS to accommodate variations among surveys. 

StEPS is also comprised of integrated modules. These enable users to check-in questionnaires,   edit data, update company mailing address and contact information, query data, and schedule company follow-up calls, among other tasks Point-and-click menus guide users through each modules. StEPS is updated quarterly to incorporate user enhancements, programming fixes, and new modules.

Survey users access StEPS from networked Census Bureau personal computers with a unique user-id and password combination.  The type of access account a user has depends on their role and the survey(s) he or she works on. All access to StEPS is within the Census Bureau security firewall. 

Because StEPS data is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act as well as potentially covered by the confidentially provisions of Title 13, Title 15, and/or other statutes and regulations, access is subject to all applicable departmental and bureau security policies.

III. Prospective Trainees

Trainees will be Census Bureau employees and contractor support employees. Most if not all have at least a four-year college degree or equivalent. They include:
            
?	New hires who have no experience with survey procedures or StEPS.
?	New users who are familiar with survey procedures in general, but have no experience with the survey area where they are now working or with StEPS.
?	Migration users who are experienced in the subject matter area, but have no StEPS experience.  Usually, this will be the case when a survey is migrating to StEPS.
?	Existing users who have StEPS experience, but require training on new functionality.
?	Programmers who will develop the StEPS programming code 

IV.	StEPS Online Overview Training Requirements

A.	Capabilities/Skills:

After finishing the training, the analysts/programmers must:

?	Understand the background and be familiar with the definition of StEPS.
?	Understand core StEPS functions and capabilities
?	Know common StEPS terminology
?	Know how to set up an account in StEPS
?	Be able to log on to StEPS and change record IDs, survey statistical periods, and other parameters 
?	Be able to use windows to navigate within StEPS, and understand the proper way to exit screens
?	Have a fundamental understanding of the major StEPS modules, including Review and Correction, Parameters, and Edits.
?	Understand the use of the pull-down menus and function keys used throughout StEPS. Know how to identify the different StEPS servers for production and development (i.e. EPBU10, EPBU01)
?	Understand StEPS data sets (item, c1, and control)
?	Understand StEPS data structures

B.	Other Requirements

StEPS training cannot interfere with production requirements. Actual survey data is protected by privacy and confidentiality requirements. This may imply a need for a separate training exercise database with fictional data.

Individual StEPS trainees will not receive a grade or pass or fail the training. However, we would like to have a means of assessing the overall effectiveness of the training in conveying the knowledge and capabilities outlined above.

Because StEPS is frequently modified, we will prefer a training module that can be easily updated by ?in-house? programmers.

The training shall be accessible from the trainee?s desktop computer over the Census Bureau network. The Census Bureau network is Windows-based and our personal computer operating system is Windows XP.

Because interruptions may occur, we would prefer that the trainee be able to interrupt the training module as needed and return to the last screen viewed when he or she returns to the training.

V.	Government-provided Resources: 

The training creator will have access to in-house Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and programmers for consultation regarding the training content and functions.

In accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supples have been deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system and competition would result in both substantial duplication cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirement.  The primary purpose of this action is to procure a Memex based nation-wide criminal database in Iraq, to include manager/administrator training of Iraqi personnel at five separate locations for the Ministry of Defense (MoD) which is fully compatible with the existing Memex systems in place at the Ministry of Interior (MoI).  In this effort compatibility between the systems in place at MoI and this requirement for MoD is paramount to ensure a seamless flow of information between the two ministries.  Even small discrepancies in data collection/sharing may compromise the security interest of both the United States and Iraqi Governments.  Furthermore, this requirement must be in place no later than 1 March 2007.  Due to the time constraints placed upon the requirement full and open competition will lead to unacceptable delays in fulfilling this requirement.  This announcement constitutes the only notice. The reference number is W91GYO-07-R-0030.  The following FAR and DFAR     Clauses apply: FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders.

<SUBJECT>A -- Method of Forming High Silicon Steels and High Silicon Steel Strip
<DESC>Notice of Partnering and Licensing Opportunity:  Method of Forming High Silicon Steels and High Silicon Steel Strip

Description

The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is developing know-how and intellectual property that can improve the economics of manufacturing steel and steel sheet products by eliminating the slab casting, reheating/homogenization, and hot-rolling unit operations while significantly reducing energy consumption.  INL?s process appears to have particular application to silicon steel manufacturing, because the method of forming the steel allows for unique material properties and metal forming.   

Higher silicon varieties of steel (above 3.5 wt%), which are favored on the basis of increased resistivity and lower magnetostriction, are precluded from production by difficulties in cold rolling.  INL?s novel process may enable fabrication of steel and steel strip with silicon (Si) levels of up to 6.5 wt%.  This novel process may allow for: 1) higher Si levels in silicon steel strip (up to 6.5 wt%), 2) increased production rates, 3) reduced casting flaws such as nonuniform grain structure, centerline segregation and surface bleeds, 4) microstructural benefits, 5) significant decreases in segregation, solid solubility extension, suppression of secondary-phase precipitation, and formation of metastable phases and 6) reduced costs. Conventional silicon steels contain up to about 3.5 wt.% Si and are widely used in applications where magnetic resistances are of concern, such as transformers, power generators, and motors.  Higher Si levels may allow for improved performance of these devices.  

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects, further developing this technology, and/or commercializing this technology.  An approved nondisclosure agreement will be require prior to discussing the technology.   It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL has several patents on the process as well as U.S. patent applications.  These patents may be licensed exclusively or non-exclusively.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.

A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $50,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).   This requirement is restricted to this Emerging Small Business and the NAICS code 561210, PSC code R408, and SIC code 8744 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required propietary items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item RAQ072103.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested proprietary data license services at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- RENTAL OF SMART RADAR VEHICLE
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with the University of Oklahoma for use of the SMART Radar Truck number 1. The SMART-R program is a collaborative research program involving the following four major weather research institutions: NSSL, Texas Tech University (TTU), University of Oklahoma (OU) and Texas A & M University (TAMU).  Under this program, two mobile 5-cm radar vehicles titled to OU will be used to study convective and mesoscale atmospheric processes to help improve forecasts of significant weather events.  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NOAA signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperative action regarding debris-flow forecasting and research, and outlined a program for operations and research.  This joint-agency plan calls for a regional debris flow forecast/warning demonstration for most of Southern California and the establishment of an Intensive Research Area (IRA) in a recently burned mountain basin within the warning area to test new concepts in rainfall monitoring and refinement of rainfall thresholds for the issuance of debris flow warnings. Obtaining high-resolution quantitative precipitation estimations (QPE) and monitoring storm airflow and thermodynamics are key elements in testing these concepts.  As part of the IRA, NSSL proposes to deploy a truck-mounted C-band Doppler weather radar to make very high resolution rainfall observations over the recent burn area. The rainfall data will be used to refine thresholds for issuance of debris flow warnings by the NWS over other burn areas.  The base for the radar will be the Pyramid Lake Reservoir north of Los Angeles.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE 100K).  No solicitation is planned. This synopsis is issued for information only.  Based on the memorandum of agreement, both of these SMART-R vehicles have limited availability to only these four institutions.  Anticipated award date February  14, 2007.

<SUBJECT>Y -- BEALE AFB Housing Privatization
<DESC>MWH Americas, Inc, (MWH) acting on behalf of the Air Force Program Office-San Antonio, and the Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the Beale Air Force Base project on or about 24 January 2007.  MWH  intends to employ a one-step RFP process.  In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references and access to financial resources, financial strategy as well as a description of its technical approach to the Beale AFB project as described in the RFP.  MWH will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranked Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force.  The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction. These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP.  The project involves a real estate transaction to privatize all of the military family housing for Beale AFB. The Government will lease land and convey 1,202 existing housing units and other improvements by fee ownership to the Successful Offeror.  The project requires that a minimum of 798 family housing units and related infrastructure, meeting the project development demographics, and in an acceptable manner through replacement, renovation, new construction, modernization, or demolition be provided as a rental community primarily to Beale AFB military members and their families.  The Project Owner will finance, plan, design and construct improvements, as well as own and operate the rental housing development for military families for 50 years.  The Government's goal is to provide military families access to safe, secure, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing in a community where they will choose to live.  An Industry Forum was conducted on January 17, 2007 at Beale AFB.  The Industry Forum slide presentation, attendance list and the Statement of Need are currently posted on the project web site:  http://pscmhc.co

<SUBJECT>84 -- National Exigency T-Shirts
<DESC>Federal Biz Opps Notice
	?National Exigency? for T-Shirts

This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) regarding FPI?s production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) codes 8415 - Clothing, Special Purpose and 8420, Underwear and Nightwear, Men?s.

A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product?s expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that ?increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.?

On January 3, 2007, FPI received an official request from the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP).  The correspondence requested FPI to fulfill DoD?s need for  t-shirts, grey, olive green and brown in FSC codes 8415 and 8420. FPI?s FY 2007 sales ceiling for tshirts is $19.2 million and 3.9 million units.  Based on year-to-date sales, the additional work represented by the DoD request would cause FPI to exceed the sales ceilings for t-shirts.

The DoD request states that ?FPI?s flexibility to meet our ever changing customer demand is important to DSCP?s ability to support the war fighter.? 

FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines? ?national exigency? provision.  In light of the military?s critical need for this item, FPI staff requested its Board to invoke the ?national exigency? provision for t-shirts.  On January 24, 2007, FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request.  Accordingly, FPI?s sales in t-shirts may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.

It should be noted that the national exigency provision of FPI?s guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military operations.  While the requested production levels are deemed to be on a temporary basis, at this time, DoD does not know how long the requirement for additional production in t-shirts will last.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD?s expanded needs will continue as long as the Army is involved in overseas conflicts.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI?s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC 20534. Attention: FPI Board of Directors.

<SUBJECT>D--On Line Medical Subscription Database
<DESC>The Veterans Intergrated Service Network (VISN 11) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) with UpToDate, Inc 95 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA 02453.  The agency need is for an online clinical reference website.  The government has determined that UpToDate Inc. is the only responsible source able to provide these services because UpToDate is a unique clinical reference that gives current answers to patient care, diagnosis and treatment questions in seconds at the point-of-care.  A well-known faculty of over 3,000 authors writes the original text.  Inclusion of specific recommendation for diagnosis and treatment make UpToDate unique among clinical information databases.  UpToDates unique features and benefits include in-house physician review for over 300 medical journals and incorporate significant clinical findings daily.  The benefit of UpToDate is that it improves organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of care by helping physicians stay current on studies, trials and medical information, and clinical management.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and the Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Information may be submitted to the VISN 11, Attn: Joyce Miller (90CSC), 1481 W. Tenth St., Indianapolis, IN 46202, Phone 317-988-1829 or Fax 317-988-1809.  See numbered note 22.

Product Description

Triple Output High Voltage Power Supply with 3 Timed Relays 

The power supply was designed specifically for use with a capillary electrophoresis cell. It has 3 variable high voltage outputs; 2 positive and one negative. The 3 supplies are internally connected to a common earth ground for safety and are voltage regulated and current limited. The voltage and current of the supplies can be individually monitored 
with a 4 1/2 digit display. 	.

In normal operation the 3 power supply outputs are connected to the electrophoresis cell through the timed relay matrix. A common (COM), a normally open (NO) and a normally closed (NC) pin is available for each of the 3 relays. The relays are switched simultaneously. The output and input pins of the 3 relays are electrically isolated from each other as well as ground. The internal microprocessor initiates a timed closure of the relays that is dependant on the setting of the rotary selector switch. A custom timing sequence can also be programmed into the non-volatile memory of the processor by the end user. Custom programming is accomplished through the serial port on the supply. The programming software is available at no cost and relies on a subset of the BASIC language. The software is compatible with Windows, Linux and Macintosh platforms and is available for free download from: http://www.parallax.com/html_pages/downloads/software_basic_stamp.asp 
Programming requires a PC with an open serial port and 9 pin cable (not supplied).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS Code is 334413, Size Standard not to exceed 500.  
 
 Solicitation/Purchase Requisition number F2KBAF6324A100 is issued as a BRAND NAME OR EQUAL Request for Quote (RFQ).  TECHNICAL LITERATURE MUST BE SUBMITTED FOR EQUAL PRODUCTS OFFERED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM A TECHNICAL EVALUATION. NO FURTHER REQUEST WILL BE MADE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED LITERATURE AND FAILURE TO SUBMIT MAY RESULT IN YOUR OFFER BEING ELIMINATED FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION. OFFERS MUST MEET ALL MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS. This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14 effective 22 Nov 06.

The Government intends to award the following:

(CLIN 0001) Coherent MBR Single Frequency Ring Ti: Saphire ring laser with electronic mode locking. Part Number 1106748. QUANTITY: 1 EA
SPECIFICATIONS: 
1)	The Ti:Saph lasers electrical and cooling system must be compatible with the pump laser Coherent V18 Nd:YAG.  The laser must deliver >3.5 Watts of  CW power with no more than 1.75% rms noise from 10Hz to 1 GHz when pumped by a Coherent Verdi V18 Nd:YAG laser.
2)	The laser must have electronic locking for single-longitudinal-mode output.  Tuning must be from 700nm to 1100nm, and must include broadband optics, enabling us to change wavelength without changing all the internal mirrors.
3)	Must use Brewster plates to change wavelength.  These allow us to change wavelength without realigning the entire system.  We cannot use the mounted mirror method to change cavity length, and therefore wavelength.
4)	Must have a monolithic resonator block-one piece to maintain system alignment and stability.
5)	Must have a bowtie cavity containing no more than four mirrors.  More mirrors will introduce greater losses in our laser power, and decrease beam stability.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revised the specfications and extend the response due date to February 2, 2007.  The additional requirements for the camera should be changed to state, an integrated mechanical shutter is desirable but optional.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NB847000703868DT.  The proposed procurement is a Total Small Business set aside.  NAICS Code:  334516.  Small Business Size Standard: 500 Employees. 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Ion Storage Group requires a sensitive camera to image the low-light level fluorescence from trapped ions. As the number of ions in this work can be very small (even as small as a single ion), a camera with extreme low light level capabilities (essentially photon counting sensitivity) is required. Because the camera will also be used for laser beam set-up and alignment, it must have a variable gain and be able to withstand occasional strong signals without damage to the camera.  The NIST work requires high resolution (less than 20 micrometer pixels).  These requirements are met by an electron multiplication CCD (EMCCD) camera using an E2V Technologies EMCCD chip. Photon counting sensitivity on essentially no background requires cooling the chip to below -80 degrees C. The laser induced fluorescence we are detecting is in the ultraviolet region (UV) of the spectrum (3 13 nm and 280 nm).  Therefore NIST requires a back illuminated chip with a UV sensitive coating with an overall effective quantum efficiency of 35 % or greater at these wavelengths.  Additional requirements for the camera include:  minimum of 512 x 512 pixels, less than -80 degrees C thermoelectric cooling with forced ambient (@ 20 C) air, UV grade fused silica window with UVAR coating on both sides, choice of at least 5 and 10 MHz pixel read out rates with the EMCCD amplifier, minimum of a 1 MHz pixel read out rate with a traditional amplifier, less than 0.005 spurious events/pixel/frame with the 10 MHz EMCCD read out rate, software for controlling the camera with a PC.  An integrated mechanical shutter is desirable but optional.

The required delivery is within 70 calendar days after receipt of order and shall be made F.O. B. Destination to NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305.  Award will be made based on price (provided that the quoted equipment meets the requirements of this RFQ). Documentation that the camera meets the above specifications must be supplied and will be used only to determine product compliance with the Government's requirements. This can be done through a company data sheet or specification sheet.
Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by e-mail.  You may submit your quote by e-mail, fax, or by mail.  Quotes must be received on or before close of business February 2, 2007. Notwithstanding responses received--it is at the discretion of the government to add additional sources and/or consider other quotes received after close of due date if it is in the best interest of the Government.  Please include delivery schedule, business size, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items--Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.
