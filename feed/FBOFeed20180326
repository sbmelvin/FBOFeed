<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br />AFRL/RITE requires a purchase of a Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROGscan) system that provides real-time ultra-short pulse measurements and has appropriate wavelength coverage, high resolution, and works with existing laser systems. The FROGscan Ultra system includes the following:
<p>Qty of 1<br />FS-Ultra 2<br />FROG system for real-time measurements of ultrafast laser pulses with integrated cover and advanced electronics. Includes one SHG crystal: 200 micron thick BBO cut at 29.2 degrees.</p>
<p>Wavelength range: see spectrometers listed below</p>
<p>Pulse Length range: 12 fs - 5 ps ( greater than 20 ps using optional hollow retros)</p>
<p>Temporal range software programmable up to 60 ps</p>
<p>Temporal resolution: 2 fs or better</p>
<p>Spectral resolution: see spectrometers listed below</p>
<p>Pulse complexity: TBWP up to ~ 50</p>
<p>Phase accuracy: 0.01 radians</p>
<p>Real-time sensitivity (Ipeak * Iave): ~ 4 W^2</p>
<p>Averaged sensitivity (Ipeak * Iave): ~ 0.01 W^2</p>
<p>Input beam size: 2 - 8 mm, collimated</p>
<p>Polarization: Horizontal</p>
<p>Acquisition speed: greater than 2 Hz (64 x 64 grid)</p>
<p>Physical Dimensions: 33 cm x 33 cm x 19 cm</p>
<p>Integrated Cover</p>
<p>Advanced Electronics</p>
<p>Power requirements: 100 - 230 VAC, 50-60 Hz</p>
<p>Electrical plug style: US NEMA 5-15</p>
<p>Qty of 1<br />HR2000+: High Resolution Spectrometer 2048 elements<br />Slits: 10 microns</p>
<p>Grating: 12 (2400 g/mm)</p>
<p>Start Wavelengths: 347.0 nm</p>
<p>Spectrometer Resolution: 0.091 nm</p>
<p>Input Range (1000 fs): 695.0-878.6 nm</p>
<p>Input Range (100 fs) 704.0 nm - 964.3 nm</p>
<p>Effective Resolution: 0.26 mm</p>
<p>Qty of 1<br />Alignment Cameras Option</p>
<p>Two alignment cameras for aiding in system alignment to input laser and internal alignment.</p>
<p>Includes drivers and integrated software.</p>
<p>Qty of 1<br />Software-controlled Crystal Tilt Option<br />Crystal Tilitng controlled by stepper motor via VideoFROGscan.</p>
<p>Qty of 1<br />VideoFROGscan<br />VideoFROG scan real time data acquisition and analysis software.</p>
<p>64-bit Windows 7,8,10 only</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>MesaPhotonics<br />1550 Pacheco St.<br />Santa Fe, NM 87505</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to have a system that not only provides real-time ultra-short pulse measurements, has the appropriate wavelength coverage, and high resolution, but it must also be compatible with the existing pulsed laser systems. It is essential to have a system that produces 1-10+ picosecond pulse widths, and specific laser wavelengths in the range of 700-740 nm. Other manufactures are unable to meet this requirement and procuring a new system would result in significant program delays, resulting in duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>FUNDS are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this contract action. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an Offeror for any costs. <br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 April 2018.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $15M.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), has selected specific samples of serum and liver from an inter-agency study investigating peri- and post-natal effects of Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in Wistar Han IGS rats for global genomic characterization of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) effects on endogenous metabolism (metabolomics) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS).  The purpose of this project is to: 1) determine metabolomic fingerprinting of biotransformation pathways and toxicological endpoints following peri- and post-natal TBBPA exposure in rats and 2) use genome-scale metabolic network modeling to identify mechanistic pathways for these endpoints to address human exposure issues.  The results of these analyses will be combined with other biological endpoints being investigated at the National Toxicology Program and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to further substantiate the chemical basis of metabolic disease risk.<br /><br />The Metabolism of Xenobiotics team at the Research Center for Food Toxicology (TOXALIM) at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) has developed a specific analytical and bioinformatics pipeline, including the MetExplore webserver (www.metexplore.fr) to address the question of how to decipher the mechanisms of action of low dose EDCs through unbiased/untargeted global approaches to toxicology. The team has been involved in studies related to EDCs for over 20 years, focusing on the relationship between biotransformation pathways and toxicological endpoints related to human exposures.<br /><br />NCI CCR requires NMR metabolomics and statistical analysis along with annotation of NMR longitudinal analysis and LC-HRMS metabolomics, annotation, and data integration of rat serum and liver tissue from pre- and post-natal rats exposed to Tetrabromobisphenol A determined at INRA/TOXALIM using the AXIOM platform.  The goal is to describe the genome-level changes caused by peri- and post-natal exposure to EDCs like TBBPA and to use experimental systems to define the biological mechanism of such changes.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM ET, on April 9, 2018.  All responses and questions must be via email to Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer at miguel.diaz@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification through SAM.GOV and have Representations and Certifications filled out.

<SUBJECT>Production of clinical-grade gamma-retrovirus vector encoding a bicistronic anti-CD19/CD20 chimeric antigen receptor construct

<CONTACT>Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer, Phone 2042765439, Email miguel.diaz@nih.gov
<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), The Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, a clinical-grade gene therapy vector from Vector Production Facility Translational Core Laboratories Cincinnati Children's Hospital, 3333 Burnet Ave, S11.400, MLC 7013 Cincinnati, OH 45229.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitionist.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 325414 and the business size standard is 1,250 employees.  It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins containing antigen-recognition domains and T-cell activation domains.  When T cells are genetically modified to express CARs, they gain the ability to specifically recognize an antigen and to kill cells expressing the antigen.  In previous clinical trials, CAR-expressing T cells have been shown to have potent anti-malignancy activity against leukemia and lymphoma.  In particular, CARs targeting CD19 have been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials, but extension of CAR T-cell therapies to other malignancies has not yet been widespread.  NCI ETIB have designed and constructed a bicistronic construct encoding CARs targeting CD19 and CD20.  This construct is encoded by a gamma-retroviral vector.  NCI ETIB plans to use this transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector that is subject of this document to genetically modify T cells from patients with lymphoma.  Lymphoma cells express CD19 and/or CD20.  NCI ETIB will use the T cells genetically modified with the proposed vector to treat patients with multiple myeloma.<br /><br />NCI ETIB plans to conduct clinical trials of T cells genetically engineered to express an anti-CD19 CAR and an anti-CD20 CAR by a bicistronic vector.  This vector will be a transiently-produced gamma-retroviral vector that is the subject of this document.  The vector needs to be a clinical-grade, transiently-produced gamma-retroviral vector.  This work has potential to be an important advance in the treatment of lymphoma.  Time is of the essence because new treatments are urgently needed by patients with advanced lympho mas.  NCI ETIB cannot progress to a clinical trial until this gene-therapy vector is produced.<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), The Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) requires a clinical-grade gene therapy vector needed for genetically-engineering patients' T cells before the T cells are re-infused back into the patients.  This requirement is for production of a clinical-grade, transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector.  This vector needs to be produced by December of 2018 to allow opening of a clinical trial in early 2019.  The vector produced for this project must be clinical-grade for use in a human clinical trial; it must be suitable for research conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application approved by the FDA.<br /><br />Contractor shall produce 20 liters of clinical-grade gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector for use in a clinical trial.  This gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector will be produced by the transient transfection method, and the vector must be completed by December of 2018.  The vector will encode a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing CD19 and CD20.  The intended use of this vector is to transduce patient T cells.  These T cells will be administered as a treatment for lymphoma in a clinical trial. The vector will be gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) pseudotyped. The vector will be generated in 293T cells.  The contractor will provide packaging plasmids.  The NCI will provide a plasmid encoding the CAR also known as the expression construct.  This requirement shall include full testing of the vector to satisfy requirements for clinical use including testing for replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), testing for mycoplasma, endotoxin, adventitious virus, residual plasmid DNA, residual cellular DNA, transfer of E1A sequences, transfer of SV40 sequences, and testing for bacterial sterility.  The contractor must provide documentation of vector test results for inclusion in applications to the Food and Drug Administration.  The produced vector must be able to transduce primary human T cells to a degree that at least 20% of primary human T cells will express the chimeric antigen receptor gene on the T-cell surface as measured by flow cytometry.  Shipment of the gamma-retroviral vector from the site of production to a storage site is not included in this contract, but temporary storage of the vector for up to 6 months is included.<br /><br />It must be emphasized that the vector must be a gamma-retrovirus.  NCI ETIB cannot use a lentivirus or any other type of gene-therapy vector such as an adenovirus.  NCI ETIB must have a gamma-retrovirus because all preclinical testing of the bicistronic chimeric antigen receptor constructs have been conducted with gamma-retroviral vectors, switching to a lentivirus at this point would require extensive additional preclinical experiments, which are time-consuming and expensive.  Adenoviruses are not useful for this project as there are major technical differences between gamma-retroviruses and adenoviruses.  These differences between gamma-retroviruses and adenoviruses make adenoviral vectors useless for the goals of this project.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

Proposal documents will be available for download in Microsoft Word, HTML, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe PDF; Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format; and drawings will be available in PDF format.   Please Note:  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.</p>
<p>Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering.  The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List and a Watchlist where you can add your company's interest.  Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Interested vendors and plan holders are required to visit the website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the synopsis or solicitation documents.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with the DOI are required to have an active registration in the Systems for Awards Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov.   You are also required to have a DUNS number in order to conduct business with the Federal Government.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation announcement is not a solicitation document, but pre-notice of an upcoming solicitation.  Specific instructions on submitting your proposal will be contained in the solicitation documents to be issued on or after the date listed below. <br /><br />Proposed Solicitation Issue Date:  Estimated on or about Wednesday, April 11, 2018.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Title of Project:  Replace / Relocate Unsafe / Unhealthy / Unsustainable Visitor Center, Timpanogos Cave National Monument, TICA 152836</p>
<p>Description:  <br />This project will construct at the cave trailhead a permanent 2000 sf (approximate net sf) visitor contact station.  This facility replaces a 2932 sf "temporary" trailer &amp; attached storage installed in 1992, and a 660 sf concession facility with 1250 sf covered eating area.  Visitor and employee safety drives these proposals.  Relocating the facility to the east of present location will reduce the rock fall hazard and get the structures out of the 100-yr floodplain.  The visitor center will include a tour ticket sales area, restrooms, storage for staging materials going to the cave and for emergency response equipment, outdoor waiting/staging area plus multi-purpose outdoor space to seat 120 (2 school buses), cooperating association sales area, cave orientation film viewing area, and visitor information/interpretation.  The project includes utility extensions and required site work.  A Federal Highways project for pedestrian safety will be realigning Utah Highway 92 against American Fork Creek, so that almost all the parking for the visitor contact station will be on the same side of the canyon as the contact station and trailhead.  As a part of this project, parking will be reconstructed to adjust to the new highway location and new visitor center location.  Rockfall hazard will also be mitigated in building design and location.  Sustainable building and energy efficiency requirements for new construction will be met with net-zero energy (site) design and LEED Silver design goals.</p>
<p>Visitor and employee safety drives these proposals.  Rock fall in this narrow, steep walled canyon is common.  Injuries from rock fall are common and as recently as the 1990s rock fall caused visitor deaths a 1/4 mile up canyon from the Monument.  The temporary visitor facility and concession is located in an area of frequent rock fall and rocks have damaged and penetrated the visitor building.  Replacement facilities will provide additional structural strength in the walls and roof to withstand most rock fall.  Moving the visitor center to the east places it out of the 100-yr floodplain, and in an area that is less susceptible to rock fall, since it is not as directly under a high cliff of the existing location.  A Rockfall barrier/fence will be located on the south side of parking.</p>
<p>Type of Procurement:  It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed-price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal.  The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range:  Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000</p>
<p>Estimated Period of Performance:  September 4, 2018 - June 1, 2019</p>
<p>Proposal receipt date is not known at this time.  The actual date will be established in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal meeting may be posted and date/location will be noted in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered.  It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.  Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov .</p>

It is the Governments intent to utilize the contract resulting from this solicitation to accomplish Basewide  
Custodial Services. The resulting contract will be a combination firm-fixed price (FFP) and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract. Work will be performed at the Naval Support Activity (NSA Crane), Crane, Indiana and the Glendora Test Facility at Sullivan Indiana. It is the intention of this solicitation to provide all labor, equipment, tools, supplies, environmental controls, transportation, supervision, quality control, and management necessary to perform custodial services basewide.

  The Glendora Test Facility is located approximately 60 miles northwest of NSA Crane.  

The proposed solicitation will contain provisions for a 12-month base period plus four 12-month option periods, to be exercised at the Governments discretion.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.

The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561720 Janitorial Services. The Small business Size Standard is $18.0 million.

<p>A sources sought notice was posted on 14 February 2017 under N44255FY17MACC on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) to conduct market research. Responses were due on 15 March 2017. Based upon the responses received, it is determined that the solicitation be advertised as a SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB)/HUBZone MACC SET ASIDE COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. The NAVFAC Northwest Small Business Office concurs with the decision.</p>

The work will be limited to the NAVFAC Northwest Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alaska, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. It is anticipated that most of the work will occur in Washington State; however projects may occur anywhere in the United Sates.</p>
<p>The procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award up to six (6) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and non-price factors considered. AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED. THEREFORE OFFERORS' INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS' BEST TERMS.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DESCRIPTION. This is a Multiple Award IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. Types of projects include, but are not limited to administrative facilities, housing facilities, child care centers, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, manufacturing and industrial facilities, communication facilities, special access program facilities (SAPF) or sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIF's), aviation facilities (i.e. hangars, control towers, etc.), and other similar facilities.</p>
<p>AWARD INFORMATION: Phase 1 of the solicitation process will consist of Prequalification of Sources. In accordance with DFARS 236.272, proposals will be evaluated on: Factor 1: Technical Approach; Factor 2: Experience; and Factor 3: Past Performance. Following the review, evaluation, and rating of these proposals, the Government intends to select the highest rated Offerors to receive the technical requirements package to participate in Phase 2 of this solicitation process. Proposers should be advised THE DETERMINATION OF PREQUALIFIED FIRMS MAY BE MADE WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION RECEIVED. ONLY FIRMS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES AND ARE DETERMINED TO POSSESS THE NECESSARY COMPETENCIES EXPRESSED IN THE PREQUALIFICATION CRITERIA MAY SUBMIT A PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO PHASE 2 OF THE SOLICITATION. For Phase 2 of the solicitation, proposals<br />will be evaluated on: Factor 4: Safety; Factor 5: Technical Solution; Factor 6: - Energy Design Reduction; and Price (if applicable). The relative importance of the technical factors when combined is equal to the performance confidence assessment rating. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined are approximately equal to price. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to use tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government; to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposer or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT FULLY INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD THE CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or an aggregate value of $240 million for all contracts awarded, whichever occurs first. The task order range for this contract is between $5,000,000 and $20,000,000. The government guarantees an award amount of $25,000 to each contract awarded as a result of this solicitation over the full term of the contract.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the firms awarded a contract will have to have a minimum bonding capacity of $20 million per project and $40 million aggregate. This bonding capacity will ensure a contractor will have sufficient bonding for individual task orders and the bonding capacity to submit proposals to more than one Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The seed project will be a construction project within the NAVFAC Northwest AOR to be determined at a later date.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED. The solicitation will be available on FBO at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<ARCHDATE>04302018
<CONTACT>Jones, Sammie
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT FOR SOLE SOURCE
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to award a sole source purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Viewpoint Life Sciences to purchase two each Zebrafish behavior monitoring systems.
EPA's laboratory uses zebrafish to evaluate developmental neurotoxic effects of various chemicals by measuring locomotor responses (i.e. behavior responses).  To analyze the behavior of larval zebrafish, a system consisting of an enclosure which houses the test animals, an infrared sensitive video camera and a light source (both white light and infrared) is needed. This enclosure protects the fish from any extraneous conditions that could be a confounding factor during behavior testing, such as noise, vibrations or temperature fluctuations.  A computer with specialized software controls the operation of the camera and the chosen light levels, records a video and tracks the movements of the zebrafish larvae in a microtiter plate.  The software can follow the movement of all 96 larvae simultaneously and then calculate various endpoints and export them in an Excel format.
The justification for procurement of the above components from Viewpoint Life Sciences is based on the following factors:
1)	System must be easily scalable:  up to 4 testing enclosures/boxes can be used in parallel employing only one computer and one software license.

2)	The testing enclosure/box must:
a)	Have a lighting system that is heat free and does not require water flow to cool down the system. The circulation of a cooling liquid around the microplate reduces image sharpness and thus reduces accuracy when tracking the movement of each larvae.  Also, the cooling liquid causes condensation on the camera lens and is difficult to work with (drips of liquid on top of the microplate distorts the image and causes a loss of data).  A Temperature Control Unit, if required, costs an additional ~$6000 and results in a larger footprint in EPA's very limited space used for behavior testing. Veiwpoint Zebrabox does not require one.
b)	Have a vertical sliding door with multiple positions to allow access to the microplate from the front and side; allows for dosing of larval zebrafish that are already positioned for testing, to eliminate disruption caused by moving the plate.  The Viewpoint Zebrabox allows access from both front and sides.
c)	Have a high resolution optical system consisting of aerospace grade mirrors which allows full access to plate from above, found exclusively in the Viewpoint Zebrabox.  The Viewpoint Zebrabox allows full access to the plate at all times.
d)	Have a double anti-vibration system to eliminate external vibrations that can alter fish behavior.
e)	Must be compatible with a shaker/vibration module which actually vibrates the plate, not tap the plate.  Viewpoint's system uses a true vibration action.
f)	Must be compatible with kit for measuring visual motor response. 

3)	The software must:
a)	Perform simultaneous analysis of up to 96 animals.
b)	Allow replay of the raw data with a different protocol.
c)	Calculate locomotor endpoints to include: distance traveled, position and trajectory, time spent in area, entry count in each area, counting of various states (very small movement, small movement, ambulatory movement), duration in each state, transition count of states, distance moved in each state, full path of fish, replay of data in case of protocol change.
d)	Produce output that is Office compatible.

4)	Visual Motor response kit with Vibration module must:
a)	Provide light levels ranging from 0 to 8000 lux.
b)	Utilize an infrared high sensitivity camera with frame rate up to 60 fps (frames per second) and image definition up to 1024*768, with optical infrared filter.
c)	Provide sharp picture quality and full view of microtiter plate
d)	Shake the microplate with a frequency range of 20 to 20,000 Hz and 40 W amplifier.
e)	Utilize a software module to program vibrations: vibration modulation control and sequences, vibration time, duration and frequency.  The Viewpoint system produces clear images. The Viewpoint vibration module allows for a wide range of settings.
 
Only the Viewpoint Zebrabox Revolution meets the above stated requirements.
The circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106-1(b) "Soliciting from a single source".  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response ONLY to Sammie Jones at jones.sammie@epa.gov.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<p>"Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s): Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs."</p>
<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional architect and engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK for FTQW 18-0321 Repair Arctic Utilidor for the Central Heat &amp; Power Plant (CH&amp;PP) South to replace the existing steam main, condensate return, and water and sewer lines servicing buildings 3446, 6209, 3417, 3419, 3420, and the lateral that runs from the manhole MH 524-1 to MH 525-1.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Eielson AFB was chosen as the preferred alternative for the F-35A mission beddown. Utilidor systems are already planned to be upgraded in size and standards to service the incoming two F-35 squadrons due to increased capacity of building utilities. However, the existing companion project (FTQW180111) does not include upgrading lateral systems at the above-mentioned locations. During severe arctic winters, facilities which lose heating for even short periods may freeze up in less than four (4) hours. Eielson's utilidors dependably distribute steam and other essential utilities to facilities throughout the installation and will do so for all new F-35 facilities. The subject project will provide heat to the existing facilities (B6209, B3416 through 3420 and between MH 526 and MH 529) by integrally linking to its companion project via the laterals. Without the subject project these existing facilities will not have a connection to the newly upgraded mainlines that will be provided by the companion project. Said upgrades would ultimately aid in the success of the new F-35A program at Eielson Air Force Base.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this posting; all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Failure to respond to this post does not preclude participation in the subsequent technical evaluation so long as a firm's SF 330 is currently on file with the 354th Contracting Squadron. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business set-aside. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $15M. The Disclosure of Magnitude for the subsequent construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 IAW FAR 36.204(f).</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>
<p>A. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with Alaska Registrations, and adequate capacity and depth in the following disciplines:</p>

<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional architect and engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK for FTQW 19-1003 Repair Parachute Shop (B1161) to investigate the possible design options of the parachute shop, B1161.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The parachute shop (bldg. 1161) at Eielson AFB, Alaska is a 7,244 SF facility that houses Air Force functions that maintain parachutes and floatation devices. The facility was built in 1952, the parachute drying tower was extended in 1957 and an addition was built on to the building in 1992. The building has undergone other various renovation and repair projects as well. The parachute shop subsystems are antiquated and have reached the end of their life. The building's operations require humidification of 40% relative humidity at 70&deg; F. Though the building has undergone renovations and repairs to mitigate the issues resulting from the high humidity levels in the winter, the building was not constructed to accommodate those conditions. A major renovation is required to repair the building to include a building envelope that can handle the required humidity levels year round. The building is sitting on known contaminated area SS521. <br /><br />This is a competitive selection process in which competing offerors' qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists  (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents of Permanent Workers of the United States) to create  publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the modernization and construction of a new annex at the James M. Ashley &amp; thomas W.L. Ashley U.S. Courthouse in Toledo, OH</p>
<p>GSA will renovate/modernize the courthouse and build an annex in order to meet the needs of its various tenants which include the US District Courts, Bankruptcy courts, and other federal agencies. This modernization project is a pivotal undertaking in extending the life of the building and helping it remain a functional and viable asset. It is expected to include the redesign and construction of important interior and exterior public spaces as well the replacement or upgrade of outdated mechanical and electrical systems.  The new annex will accommodate Judiciary growth, security enhancements, and assist with infrastructure improvement.</p>
<p>GSA allocates one &shy;half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the Ashley Courthouse Renovation and New Annex is currently estimated to be $417,610.00. One or more artists will be awarded a fixed &shy;price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are attached and available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the Ashley Courthouse Renovation and New Annex project in Toledo, Ohio, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on 03/27/2017.  Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short&shy;listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget.  GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project&#894; development of preliminary and final concepts&#894; fabrication of the artwork&#894; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary&#894; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

<SUBJECT>KSAAP Bldg. 1206 Remediation
<SOLNBR>W912DQ18R3010
<CONTACT>Dominique Howard, Contract Specialist, Email dominique.c.howard@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The former Kansas Army Ammunition Plant (KSAAP) is located in Labette County, Kansas, approximately 20 miles north of the Oklahoma state line and 30 miles west of the Missouri state line, near the town of Parsons. The 1200 Area (formerly the Casing Rework Area) refers to approximately 49 acres in the south-central portion of KSAAP. Chromium contamination at the site resulted from casing rework of 105-millimeter (mm) cartridges, which started in Building 1206 in 1953. Part of this rework process involved cleaning the casings with a chromic acid solution, the first such reported use of this chemical in the 1200 Area. At present, the site is mostly grasslands, with five brick and block buildings, a system of engineered drainage ditches and a settling pond at the southeastern end of the site (Pond #1).
<p>Building 1206 is one of 5 brick buildings in the 1200 Area. Building 1206 housed the casing rework of the 105-mm cartridges. As a result of the rework process the chromic acid penetrated portions of the building's slab and into the sub-slab soils. The slab is concrete and hexavalent chromium contamination has been found a few inches into the slab. The sub-slab soils are also contaminated with hexavalent chromium. The tasks involved will include shoring of and safety from a deteriorating brick wall, removal of a portion of the concrete slab, excavation of hexavalent chromium sub-slab soils, and backfill/restoration of the concrete slab.</p>
<p>Cleanup Criteria - The 1200 Area soil clean-up criteria for non-residential use are presented in the Final Corrective Measures Decision (CMD) (EPA, 2006). Hexavalent chromium is expected to be the only contaminant exceeding the clean-up criteria at the 1200 Area.</p>
<p><br />The actual solicitation will be issued on or about 15-May-2018.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be set aside for eligible small business concerns registered under NAICS 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services (ERS). The subsequent contract will be awarded as a construction contract.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this construction contract is estimated between $800,000 and $1,500,000<br />.<br />Proposal Evaluation: The Government is utilizing the procedures in FAR 15.3 "Source Selection" under competitive negotiated proceedings to select the proposals that represent the best value to the Government. The trade-off process inherent in best value source selection allows the government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror, per FAR 15.101. Consequently, all evaluation factors that may affect the contract award and their relative importance will be clearly stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>****It should be noted that the Former Kansas Army Ammunition Plant is a BRAC facility. As such a preference for local, small, and small disadvantaged businesses will be a part of the evaluation process.****</p>
<p>Offerors: Please be advised of on-line registration requirement in the System for Award Management (SAM) database http://www.sam.gov/ and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual On-line Representations and Certifications.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in -4.3pt 15pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 13.5pt">This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing services for Hill Air Force Base (HAFB). There are twenty five F-35 Operator Control Consoles (OCCs) that are located in Buildings 225 (Appendix D) and 233 (Appendix E).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The OCCs have controlled air-conditioning and hydraulic plumbing that pass through them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The OCC air-conditioning outlet is connected to a Portable Inline Chiller Unit (PICU) that is used to reduce the air conditioned temperature of 75-55&deg;F even lower at the aircraft point of use. The hydraulic hoses used for testing are stored on a metal frame stand and wound and un-wound by hand when needed.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in -4.3pt 15pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 13.5pt">A requirement is needed to reconfigure the PICU to a permanently Mounted Inline Chillers (MIC) and build new MICs from scratch near each OCC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same area as the MIC, the hydraulic hoses need to be converted to Auto Wind Hose Reels (AWHR). Once this requirement is solidified a formal request for proposal (RFP) will be released, this will be on a future date not yet determined.</p>

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK<br />HISTORIC BUILDING ASSESSMENT AND REPAIR COST ESTIMATING<br />DR-4336/DR-4339 (PUERTO RICO)
<p>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Historic structures are an integral part of the cultural core of Puerto Rico: its historic and social fabric, and its American identity. Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused extensive damage to historic structures across Puerto Rico. Damage includes compromised roofs, windows, doors, and other structural elements. Managers of the FEMA Natural and Cultural Resources sector and the Recovery Support Function 11 (RSF-11) in the National Disaster Recovery Framework are interested in retaining professional services to assist in assessing damage and developing cost estimates for repairing damage.</p>
<p>Congress has mandated (P.L.115-123 &sect; 21210) that FEMA and it's cooperating agencies (including the Department of the Interior) produce a strategic plan for Puerto Rico recovery within 180 days of passage of the bill (2/9/2018). The strategic plan must be based on damage estimates that meet federal damage-estimating standards. FEMA has contracted with the Rand Corporation to facilitate the writing of the strategic plan, and the federal government is contractually obligated to share damage estimates with Rand by 5/9/2018 (90-days in advance of the strategic plan's due date.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To meet the mandates stated in P.L. 115-123 &sect; 21210 in the quickest and most accurate way possible. The damage estimates produced under this Scope of Work must be produced as soon as possible, and no later than three (3) days in advance of the 5/9/2018 due date, or 5/6/2018.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirement that assessments must meet federal damage-estimating standards, this Scope of Work requires:</p>
<p>&bull; Key information about each property that will allow it to be combined with other historic properties in a final report (for example: Municipality, town, historic property number in the Oficina Estatal de Conservacion Historica (SHPO) or Instituto de Cultura Puertorrica&ntilde;a (ICP) system).<br />&bull; Completed historic property damage forms consistent with previously-produced damage assessments (example will be provided);<br />&bull; Photographs of damaged historic properties sufficient to demonstrate what damage the repair estimates include;<br />&bull; Drawings sufficient to demonstrate the work to be performed to repair damage (drawings can be computer-produced or informal sketches);<br />&bull; Estimates for capital improvements to the property that will make the property more resistant to hurricane damage in the future;<br />&bull; Contact information for all staff, so that follow-up information can be gathered with staff conducting assessments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND TASKS</p>

<p>LAB REQUESTING SERVICE: Quantum Electromagnetics Division, Physical Measurements Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>NIST-Boulder has a state-of-the-art research laboratory (the Katharine Bloggett Gebbie Building) to support the most sensitive research done at NIST. Included in this building is a Class 100 microelectronics fabrication facility, called the Boulder Micro-Fabrication Facility (BMF).   Among the many critical pieces of equipment in this laboratory is a STS Mesc Multiplex ICP Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) tool.  The DRIE is comprised of many control subsystems that are required to communicate with each other.  If the communication between these subsystems fails, the tool is inoperable and NIST mission critical work is halted since the DRIE is a critical step in many NIST mission critical devices. In order to keep a high tool uptime, the BMF requires a tool retrofit of the input/output (IO) signal system, the control systems, signal wiring, communication subsystems, computers, and software to extend the DRIE's service life.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE OF WORK:</p>

<DESC>Description(s):<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for managed services including the secure storage, management, and distribution of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals at a single site..
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to determine the capabilities of the open market to provide the services that support the Agency's requirements. The RFI responses will assist FEDSIM and the Agency with section of the most appropriate procurement source.<br />GSA FEDSIM is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as market research, to obtain industry comments about the anticipated structure of the final RFP as described below:<br />1. The Government anticipates that the final RFP will be for a total period of five years. This five year period will be structured  with a one year base and four one-year optional periods on a firm fixed price (FFP) basis. Monthly (FFP) Managed Service Charges will only commence after the contractor provides the use of a facility that satisfies ALL requirements and the contractor begins receiving the products for storage/management. The monthly Managed Service Charges shall include any facility modification costs.<br /> <br />2. The contractor will be required to obtain its own financing for any necessary facility modifications. To determine if the final RFP will be set-aside for Small Business, please follow the instructions below by providing the size standard(s) of your firm as stated in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).<br />FEDSIM plans to solicit for contractor support on the Open Market using FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition, for the storage of Government owned pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medical equipment. The contractor will provide all necessary expertise, labor, materials, and space to safely and securely, receive, store, stage, kit and prepare for shipment pallets and other containers holding these items.<br />The interested offerors should consider that:<br /> <br />1. The final RFP will require the offeror at time of proposal submission to provide not only the documented commitment from the building owner that the proposed facility will be available for use under this contract if it is awarded, but additionally that the owner has agreed to all the facility modifications required. Failure to provide this information at time of proposal submission would cause the proposal to be found non-responsive and ineligible for award.<br />-        As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns as to your ability to secure sufficient space in the required area to support a 5 year contract with a 1 year base and 4 optional years?<br /> <br />2. As stated in the RFI, the Government plans to require that the proposed facility is not located within &frac14; mile from any hazardous material (excluding those dedicated to airport operations).<br />-        As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns regarding this criterion?<br /> <br />3. The Government plans to require the Contractor to provide staff and equipment such that they can respond quickly to an emergency at any time, night or day, and transport stored materials either to the airport or over roads to other locations within strict time limits.<br />-        As a potential offeror, do you have any concerns as to your ability to staff and equip a facility so as to ensure transportation of stored materials is delivered within the allotted time limits?<br /> <br />4. Please provide any questions or other concerns you may have on the attached draft RFI.<br />RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:<br />The location "Site A" of this requirement  is sensitive information. To receive the location, all interested offerors are required to submit a signed corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) (Attachment A of the draft RFI). Upon receipt of the executed NDA, the Government will send details regarding the location. The NDA should be sent to the FEDSIM Contract Specialist, Jane Facchina (Jane.Facchina@gsa.gov).<br />All firms expressing an interest in responding to this requirement shall provide the following information:<br />a. Name and Address of Firm.<br />b. Point of Contact information (Name, Phone Number, email address)<br />c. A brief description of your responses to the above questions/issues, responses to the attached RFI Sections 1, 2 and 3 and your level of interest and ability to submit a proposal involving the site in light of the attached draft RFP requirements.<br />Responses to this notice are not considered quotes and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or the Contractor to submit a quote. The Government will not pay for the information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI. However, the information received through this RFI will be used to assist in acquisition planning for this procurement.<br />The final solicitation, when available, will be posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). It will be the Contractor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of the final RFP and any applicable amendments.<br />All responses to this RFI shall be provided to the FEDSIM Contracting Officer, Nydia Roman-Albertorio, and the FEDSIM Contract Specialist, Jane Facchina, via email at Nydia.Roman-Albertorio@gsa.gov and Jane.Facchina@gsa.gov respectively.

Background/Introduction.  The Community Nursing Home (CNH) program is a key component of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuum of care.  The Contractor agrees to provide in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Alexandria Health Care System, in Alexandria, LA at the prices specified in the section titled Schedule of Items of this IDC.    Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall cooperate with VA staff in referral of appropriate veterans for care and accept veterans of which they have the capability/capacity to care.    The term,  facilities,  shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas. VA shall have the right to inspect the CNH and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.  

Requirements
 
1. General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

2. Termination of Services. VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the CNH at any time when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients without additional costs to the Government.

3.  VA Authorizations.  Authorization for nursing home care will be submitted on VA Form 10-7078,  Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services.   Each authorization validity period will be noted on the VA Form 10-7078 with a beginning and end date.  Any extension to the original authorization validity period, regardless of the number of days, requires a new VA Form 10-7078.

4. Medicaid-Based Rates.  The current State Medicaid rates may be used as a basis for determination of VA rates.  The VA rate will include medical care, routine medications, laboratory, x-ray, therapy (ies), and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically exempted.  VA will contract for appropriate Medicaid categories of care using Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV) as a guide.  As with Medicare, a description of the RUG-IV systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et al.  

5. Primary Medical Coverage.  The assigned CNH provider is the primary medical provider during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the CNH.  The CNH provider is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Provider visits will be according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.  The assigned nursing home provider will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care; arranging easy access to VA staff for consultation; providing timely response to calls and arranging for timely provider back-up according to OBRA guidelines (42 CFR 483.40, OBRA Guidelines).

6.  Rehabilitation Criteria.     All therapy provided under this IDC will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  Therapy may require pre-approval by VA before services are provided.   Medical Restorative criteria will be used for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Therapy must be skilled, relate to safety and be restorative according to Medicare criteria.  

Description of Rehabilitative Therapy. The concept of rehabilitative therapy includes recovery or improvement in function and, when possible, restoration to a previous level of health and well-being. Therefore, evaluation, re-evaluation and assessment documented in the Progress Report should describe objective measurements which, when compared, show improvements in function, or decrease in severity, or justification for an optimistic outlook to justify continued treatment.  Covered therapy services shall be rehabilitative therapy services unless they meet the criteria for maintenance therapy requiring the skills of a therapist.  

Evaluations/re-evaluations should consider the following:  Establishment of treatment goals specific to the patient s disability or dysfunction and designed to specifically address each problem identified in the evaluation; design of a plan of care addressing the patient s disorder, including establishment of procedures to obtain goals, determining the frequency and intensity of treatment; continued assessment and analysis during implementation of the services at regular intervals; instruction leading to establishment of compensatory skills; selection of devices to replace or augment a function (e.g., for use as an alternative communication system and short-term training on use of the device or system); and patient and family training to augment rehabilitative treatment or establish a maintenance program. Education of staff and family should be ongoing.

7. Emergency Care; Financial Responsibility; Advanced Directives. In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident.  Advance directives or living wills shall be adhered to according to CNH physician s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is contacted by the private hospital provider within 72-hours of admission on the first business day following a weekend or holiday.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care.

8. HIPAA Compliance.  HIPAA compliance is required.  The Contractor must adhere to the 
provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health
Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health
information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance
with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
with VA, but VACO has recognized CNH Facilities as an entity that does not require a BAA as long as they are conducting health care on VA s behalf.  The CNH care program qualifies as a medical service, so no BAA is required.

9.  State Licensure; Access to CNH Quality of Care Reports (QASP Indicator #1).  The CNH must maintain a current and unrestricted state license to operate as a skilled nursing facility.  Changes in the status of the licensure will be immediately reported to the Alexandria VA Home and Community Care Department at 318-466-2431.  VA will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this IDC, through one or any combination of the following methods:  reviews of State agencies reports; on-site inspection of the CNH by VA staff; and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients. The CNH shall provide VA with copies of all State agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA s quality improvement or quality assurance program functions relating to this IDC, including VA s on-site inspection and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the Contractor s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

10. Corrective Action Plan (QASP Indicator #2).  The CNH will cooperate with timely development of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) related to identified deficiencies and related to State, Federal or VA surveys.  The CNH will develop in the time period specified by VA timely and appropriate CAPs for VA surveys or investigation of complaints related to quality of care or sentinel events.  The CNH will also supply related documents or data as specified by VA.  The CAPs will include but are not limited to the following criteria and shall:
 
contain elements detailing how the CNH will correct the deficiency as it relates to the individual;
indicate how the CNH will act to protect residents in similar situations;
Include the measures the CNH will take or systems that will be altered to ensure that the problem will not recur.  The CNH must look at the system and determine if a change to the existing system will work, if a new system is necessary, or if a system does not exist and must be developed;
Indicate how the CNH plans to monitor performance to make sure that solutions are permanent.  The CNH must develop a quality assurance tool for ensuring that correction is achieved and sustained.  This tool must be implemented.  Failure to implement a quality assurance tool to sustain compliance will reflect that the CNH has an ineffective quality assurance system; and
Provide dates when corrective action will be completed.

11.  Life Safety Code. The CNH s building shall conform to the most recent standards of the Life Safety Code (National Fire Protection Association Standard #101) in effect on the date of the IDC award and compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. The administrator of the CNH is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility which were in existence at the time this IDC became effective.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Safety Manager responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of the CNH and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval or disapproval of the CNH to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.  These changes may include but are not limited to: 

Interior changes requiring VA approval. Some examples of facility changes that require the VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows:   interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen or trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls or doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems;

Automatic sprinkler system.  All VA contracted CNH facilities are to be fully-equipped with a fully-automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association s (NFPA) standards and be 100% sprinkler;

Natural disasters.  In the event of a natural disaster (flood, tornado, etc.), the CNH shall communicate all action plans to VA.  The action plans will at a minimum identify temporary transfers of location, dates, and names of veterans transferred; and

Major construction; additions; and renovations. Major construction including building additions or other renovations which may affect physical plant integrity; SHALL MEET latest NFPA 101 Life/Safety Code requirements as well as any additional VA CNH construction standards in place at time of renovation or alteration.  

12. Acceptable Safety and Sanitation Practices.  Acceptable safety and sanitation practices shall be observed throughout the facility.  The CNH will address employee and patient safety practices through staff orientation, training and adherence to related policy or procedures to provide a safe and clean environment.

13.  Re-admission to the VA Hospital and Emergency Care; Notification of Death of Veterans; CNH Responsibility to Veteran s Belongings or Personal Effects (QASP Indicator #3).  VA beneficiaries who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  

When such an admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72-ours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility and notice of any veteran death within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, readmission to a VA Medical Center may be accomplished as soon as the patient s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to a VA Medical Center.  

In the event of a death of any veteran, the Contractor agrees to notify VA immediately of the death.  In the event a death of a VA beneficiary while receiving nursing home care under this IDC, the CNH will promptly notify the VA facility which authorized admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient s personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the CNH shall be delivered by the CNH to the person(s) entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the CNH for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases, the CNH will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.  CMS regulations require retention of records for five (5) years when there is no requirement in State law.

14. Leave of Absence (LOA)   Bed-Hold Statement. For re-hospitalizations or therapeutic passes, VA will pay a bed hold.  Therapeutic passes will be authorized by the CNH staff based on individual patient needs, but are generally limited to two (2) times per month and should be pre-approved.  VA will cover bed holds based on the following plan: 

 The host VA medical center will select one of the following options:
 
2 days/episode, pre-approved by VA when in the best interest of the Veteran and VA. Exceptions approved at VAMC level;

Bed-hold will begin the date the resident leaves the CNH and full per diem will resume on the date of readmission to the CNH.  Absences of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility require a new authorization agreement.  The nursing home is responsible to notify the family if a bed hold is required for a longer period.  The family would then make arrangements with the home to hold the bed.  

15. Reportable Events (QASP Indicator #4). VA requires CNHs to report to the CNH Coordinator at VA any of the following events within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday:  
Sentinel events; 
When there is a change of ownership of the CNH; 
When there is a change of nursing home administrator or Director of Nursing/Director of Nursing Service; 
substantiated allegations of mistreatment, neglect, abuse or misappropriation of CNH veterans or property; 
Elopements of CNH veterans pursuant to state regulations; 
Infectious outbreaks; 
Resident to resident or resident to staff altercations involving a CNH veteran resulting in any injury that is other than minor; 
Copies of annual surveys or substantiated complaint investigations conducted by a State oversight agency; and 
Adverse events.  Reporting shall include date of occurrence and patient disposition and outcome.  

A sentinel event may include, but is not limited to the following:

Elopement resulting in a missing patient; 
Patient abuse confirmed or under suspicion; 
A medication error resulting in patient illness or injury; 
Death or patient injury related to restraint (including side rails) use; or 
Death related to an unconfirmed or suspicious cause.   

When an adverse event occurs involving a CNH Veteran which is not determined to be a Sentinel Event (but that the State requires that the occurrence be reported to the State), such event is also to be reported to VA s CNH program office.  Some adverse events, such as minor medication errors without catastrophic outcomes, are managed by the CNH in the context of their quality improvement programs.  It is not necessary for nursing homes to report such incidents to the CNH program office.

16.  VA Actions Regarding Serious Quality of Care Deficiencies.  In cases of serious deficiencies affecting the health or safety of veterans or in cases of continued uncorrected deficiencies, VA will take one or more of the following actions in accordance with the terms and clauses of the IDC and applicable procurement regulations:

Increase VA staffing monitoring until the State survey agency clears the deficiency;
Suspend placement of veterans in the CNH;
Remove or transfer veterans under the IDC from the subject CNH;

b. Nursing Home Clinical Record:  The CNH must maintain clinical records on each veteran in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice. The clinical record must be:  complete, accurately documented, readily accessible, systematically organized, and legible.  Clinical records must contain at a minimum: 

Sufficient information to identify the resident; 
A record of the veteran s assessments, including those assessments performed by services under the IDC with the CNH; 
The plan of care and services including medication administration, provided by CNH staff and services provided under the IDC with the CNH; 
Interdisciplinary progress notes to include effect of care provided, veterans  response to treatment, change in condition, and changes in treatment; 
Medical practitioner orders which are signed and dated; 
Allergies; 
Person to contact in an emergency situation; 
Name of attending medical practitioner; and 
Advanced directives if available. 

c. Clinical Record Safeguards: The CNH must safeguard clinical record information against loss, destruction, or unauthorized use. If the CNH maintains a veteran s record by computer, electronic signatures are acceptable.  If attestation is done on computer records, safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and to provide for reconstruction of information must be in place.

18.  Specialty Services.  The CNH will assume responsibility for arranging specialty care for veterans (e.g., dental care, podiatry and ophthalmology).


19.  VA Health Care System Consultation/Resources. 

 (a)  Telephone Care Communications Systems (TCCS):  For urgent same-day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 318-466-2431/2265 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same-day appointment is anticipated; please call as early as possible.

 (b)  Admissions Conference Call Systems phone number Phone #:318-466-2431/2265
For non-emergency consultation or /evaluation for admission to the Alexandria VA Health Care System (after initial evaluation or intervention by the nursing home physician).

 (c)  After hours, weekends and holidays:  For urgent referrals or consultation contact the
Admission Conference Call System number 318-466-4402. (Urgent Care), still leave message at the above phone number.

 (d)  Transportation:  Necessary transportation to and from the VA hospital for clinics, evaluation or hospitalization will be arranged by individual nursing homes and paid by the VA hospital for CNH patients when requested.  For Clinic appointments, a consult is needed and sent to CNH for referral.

20. Charitable Contributions. The CNH will not solicit contributions, donations, or gifts from patients or family members.  Note:  Established charitable fundraising activities of a CNH fall outside the scope of this language.

21.  CNH Billing (QASP Indicator #6).  Invoices for board, care and ancillary services shall be submitted promptly to the authorizing facility by the 15th calendar day following the end of the month in which services were rendered.  The CNH will promptly notify the VA CNH Coordinator regarding any change in Veteran status:  discharge, transfer, against medical advice (AMA), hospitalization, death and/or any changes in payer source and any ability to complete timely billing.  All invoices must include the full name and address of the CNH and shall reflect the patient s name, social security number, number of days billed, RUG category (ies), and agreed upon RUG rate (s). Failure to include this information may result in delayed payment.  

Pre-approves services billed by CMS procedures or CPT codes:  All services which are pre-approved by VA as additional to the all-inclusive per diem rate must be billed according to CMS procedures or CPT codes.  The CNH will be reimbursed based on local guidelines and VA pricing schedules.

High cost drugs: All requests for additional reimbursement for high cost drugs and corresponding billing are due as soon as possible, but no later than 90 calendar days after use of products. 

Invoices:  Corrected invoices must be submitted for additional payment of any ancillary costs or changes to the original billing.  All corrected invoices must include all items that are affected by the change.

22.  Minimum Quantities; VA Payment.   It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this IDC.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this IDC, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the CNH as outlined in this IDC.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the CNH but not the day the recipient leaves a CNH unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one (1) day.

23.  VA Payments.   Payments made by VA under any contract pursuant to this IDC, constitute the total cost of nursing home care.  No additional charges will be billed to Medicare (with the exception of hospice), Medicaid, or private insurance, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the CNH or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) will not be billed for uncovered services or costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double-billing and Federal fraud.

Vendors who bill electronically using the HIPAA-compliant claims transactions must submit claims through the VA clearinghouse, Emdeon, using payer ID number 12115 for medical claims.

Vendors who are not able to use the HIPAA-compliant transactions are not required to do so.  Supporting information for monthly invoices will be mailed to:

Background/Introduction.  The Community Nursing Home (CNH) program is a key component of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continuum of care.  The Contractor agrees to provide in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Alexandria Health Care System, in Alexandria, LA at the prices specified in the section titled Schedule of Items of this IDC.    Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall cooperate with VA staff in referral of appropriate veterans for care and accept veterans of which they have the capability/capacity to care.    The term,  facilities,  shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas. VA shall have the right to inspect the CNH and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.  

Requirements
 
1. General. Nursing home facilities in the CNH program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

2. Termination of Services. VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the CNH at any time when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients without additional costs to the Government.

3.  VA Authorizations.  Authorization for nursing home care will be submitted on VA Form 10-7078,  Authorization and Invoice for Medical and Hospital Services.   Each authorization validity period will be noted on the VA Form 10-7078 with a beginning and end date.  Any extension to the original authorization validity period, regardless of the number of days, requires a new VA Form 10-7078.

4. Medicaid-Based Rates.  The current State Medicaid rates may be used as a basis for determination of VA rates.  The VA rate will include medical care, routine medications, laboratory, x-ray, therapy (ies), and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically exempted.  VA will contract for appropriate Medicaid categories of care using Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV) as a guide.  As with Medicare, a description of the RUG-IV systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et al.  

5. Primary Medical Coverage.  The assigned CNH provider is the primary medical provider during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the CNH.  The CNH provider is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Provider visits will be according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.  The assigned nursing home provider will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care; arranging easy access to VA staff for consultation; providing timely response to calls and arranging for timely provider back-up according to OBRA guidelines (42 CFR 483.40, OBRA Guidelines).

6.  Rehabilitation Criteria.     All therapy provided under this IDC will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  Therapy may require pre-approval by VA before services are provided.   Medical Restorative criteria will be used for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Therapy must be skilled, relate to safety and be restorative according to Medicare criteria.  

Description of Rehabilitative Therapy. The concept of rehabilitative therapy includes recovery or improvement in function and, when possible, restoration to a previous level of health and well-being. Therefore, evaluation, re-evaluation and assessment documented in the Progress Report should describe objective measurements which, when compared, show improvements in function, or decrease in severity, or justification for an optimistic outlook to justify continued treatment.  Covered therapy services shall be rehabilitative therapy services unless they meet the criteria for maintenance therapy requiring the skills of a therapist.  

Evaluations/re-evaluations should consider the following:  Establishment of treatment goals specific to the patient s disability or dysfunction and designed to specifically address each problem identified in the evaluation; design of a plan of care addressing the patient s disorder, including establishment of procedures to obtain goals, determining the frequency and intensity of treatment; continued assessment and analysis during implementation of the services at regular intervals; instruction leading to establishment of compensatory skills; selection of devices to replace or augment a function (e.g., for use as an alternative communication system and short-term training on use of the device or system); and patient and family training to augment rehabilitative treatment or establish a maintenance program. Education of staff and family should be ongoing.

7. Emergency Care; Financial Responsibility; Advanced Directives. In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident.  Advance directives or living wills shall be adhered to according to CNH physician s orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VA Health Care System (VAHCS) is contacted by the private hospital provider within 72-hours of admission on the first business day following a weekend or holiday.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care.

8. HIPAA Compliance.  HIPAA compliance is required.  The Contractor must adhere to the 
provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health
Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health
information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance
with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
with VA, but VACO has recognized CNH Facilities as an entity that does not require a BAA as long as they are conducting health care on VA s behalf.  The CNH care program qualifies as a medical service, so no BAA is required.

9.  State Licensure; Access to CNH Quality of Care Reports (QASP Indicator #1).  The CNH must maintain a current and unrestricted state license to operate as a skilled nursing facility.  Changes in the status of the licensure will be immediately reported to the Alexandria VA Home and Community Care Department at 318-466-2431.  VA will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this IDC, through one or any combination of the following methods:  reviews of State agencies reports; on-site inspection of the CNH by VA staff; and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients. The CNH shall provide VA with copies of all State agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA s quality improvement or quality assurance program functions relating to this IDC, including VA s on-site inspection and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the Contractor s reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.

10. Corrective Action Plan (QASP Indicator #2).  The CNH will cooperate with timely development of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) related to identified deficiencies and related to State, Federal or VA surveys.  The CNH will develop in the time period specified by VA timely and appropriate CAPs for VA surveys or investigation of complaints related to quality of care or sentinel events.  The CNH will also supply related documents or data as specified by VA.  The CAPs will include but are not limited to the following criteria and shall:
 
contain elements detailing how the CNH will correct the deficiency as it relates to the individual;
indicate how the CNH will act to protect residents in similar situations;
Include the measures the CNH will take or systems that will be altered to ensure that the problem will not recur.  The CNH must look at the system and determine if a change to the existing system will work, if a new system is necessary, or if a system does not exist and must be developed;
Indicate how the CNH plans to monitor performance to make sure that solutions are permanent.  The CNH must develop a quality assurance tool for ensuring that correction is achieved and sustained.  This tool must be implemented.  Failure to implement a quality assurance tool to sustain compliance will reflect that the CNH has an ineffective quality assurance system; and
Provide dates when corrective action will be completed.

11.  Life Safety Code. The CNH s building shall conform to the most recent standards of the Life Safety Code (National Fire Protection Association Standard #101) in effect on the date of the IDC award and compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. The administrator of the CNH is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility which were in existence at the time this IDC became effective.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Safety Manager responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of the CNH and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval or disapproval of the CNH to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.  These changes may include but are not limited to: 

Interior changes requiring VA approval. Some examples of facility changes that require the VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows:   interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen or trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls or doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems;

Automatic sprinkler system.  All VA contracted CNH facilities are to be fully-equipped with a fully-automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association s (NFPA) standards and be 100% sprinkler;

Natural disasters.  In the event of a natural disaster (flood, tornado, etc.), the CNH shall communicate all action plans to VA.  The action plans will at a minimum identify temporary transfers of location, dates, and names of veterans transferred; and

Major construction; additions; and renovations. Major construction including building additions or other renovations which may affect physical plant integrity; SHALL MEET latest NFPA 101 Life/Safety Code requirements as well as any additional VA CNH construction standards in place at time of renovation or alteration.  

12. Acceptable Safety and Sanitation Practices.  Acceptable safety and sanitation practices shall be observed throughout the facility.  The CNH will address employee and patient safety practices through staff orientation, training and adherence to related policy or procedures to provide a safe and clean environment.

13.  Re-admission to the VA Hospital and Emergency Care; Notification of Death of Veterans; CNH Responsibility to Veteran s Belongings or Personal Effects (QASP Indicator #3).  VA beneficiaries who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  

When such an admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72-ours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility and notice of any veteran death within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, readmission to a VA Medical Center may be accomplished as soon as the patient s condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to a VA Medical Center.  

In the event of a death of any veteran, the Contractor agrees to notify VA immediately of the death.  In the event a death of a VA beneficiary while receiving nursing home care under this IDC, the CNH will promptly notify the VA facility which authorized admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient s personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the CNH shall be delivered by the CNH to the person(s) entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the CNH for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases, the CNH will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.  CMS regulations require retention of records for five (5) years when there is no requirement in State law.

14. Leave of Absence (LOA)   Bed-Hold Statement. For re-hospitalizations or therapeutic passes, VA will pay a bed hold.  Therapeutic passes will be authorized by the CNH staff based on individual patient needs, but are generally limited to two (2) times per month and should be pre-approved.  VA will cover bed holds based on the following plan: 

 The host VA medical center will select one of the following options:
 
2 days/episode, pre-approved by VA when in the best interest of the Veteran and VA. Exceptions approved at VAMC level;

Bed-hold will begin the date the resident leaves the CNH and full per diem will resume on the date of readmission to the CNH.  Absences of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility require a new authorization agreement.  The nursing home is responsible to notify the family if a bed hold is required for a longer period.  The family would then make arrangements with the home to hold the bed.  

15. Reportable Events (QASP Indicator #4). VA requires CNHs to report to the CNH Coordinator at VA any of the following events within 24-hours or immediately the first business day after a weekend or holiday:  
Sentinel events; 
When there is a change of ownership of the CNH; 
When there is a change of nursing home administrator or Director of Nursing/Director of Nursing Service;

20. Charitable Contributions. The CNH will not solicit contributions, donations, or gifts from patients or family members.  Note:  Established charitable fundraising activities of a CNH fall outside the scope of this language.

21.  CNH Billing (QASP Indicator #6).  Invoices for board, care and ancillary services shall be submitted promptly to the authorizing facility by the 15th calendar day following the end of the month in which services were rendered.  The CNH will promptly notify the VA CNH Coordinator regarding any change in Veteran status:  discharge, transfer, against medical advice (AMA), hospitalization, death and/or any changes in payer source and any ability to complete timely billing.  All invoices must include the full name and address of the CNH and shall reflect the patient s name, social security number, number of days billed, RUG category (ies), and agreed upon RUG rate (s). Failure to include this information may result in delayed payment.

22.  Minimum Quantities; VA Payment.   It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this IDC.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this IDC, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the CNH as outlined in this IDC.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the CNH but not the day the recipient leaves a CNH unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one (1) day.

23.  VA Payments.   Payments made by VA under any contract pursuant to this IDC, constitute the total cost of nursing home care.  No additional charges will be billed to Medicare (with the exception of hospice), Medicaid, or private insurance, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the CNH or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) will not be billed for uncovered services or costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double-billing and Federal fraud.

Vendors who bill electronically using the HIPAA-compliant claims transactions must submit claims through the VA clearinghouse, Emdeon, using payer ID number 12115 for medical claims.

Vendors who are not able to use the HIPAA-compliant transactions are not required to do so.  Supporting information for monthly invoices will be mailed to:

The objective of the acquisition is to provide Department of Defense (DOD) Test Ranges with an optical tracking and imaging solution that consists of a remotely-operated capability, increased performance and a lower life cycle cost. The ARTIS system will provide the DOD Test Ranges the capability to track and obtain vital imagery data required for testing new and emerging weapons systems. ARTIS will enable the Test Ranges to capture Time-Space-Position Information and imagery in Visible, Mid-Wave IR, and SWIR bands. ARTIS will replace the aging fleet of legacy tracking systems, such as the Kineto Tracking Mounts.  <br>  <br> The ARTIS solution will consist of two different optical tracking systems: a small, highly dynamic Close-In Optical Tracking System that will provide improved support capabilities for high slew-rate launch and impact requirements, as well as ground-based testing scenarios and a medium-sized Fly-Out Optical Tracking System that will support longer range imaging requirements, to include ballistic missile fly-outs, mid-course tracking, and high-altitude intercepts. Both systems will incorporate multi-waveband optics to allow simultaneous sensing in Visible and Infrared bands. Computer automation, remote operability, weatherization, and improved data fusion with other Test Range systems will provide the efficiency and robustness that is not available with the current architecture.  <br>  <br> The ARTIS procurement will be conducted using full and open, competitive, Best Value-Tradeoff source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. <br>

Contracts that are awarded based on responses to this BAA are as a result of full and open competition and therefore in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."
<p>CDC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, state and local government, and private industry for research and development (R&amp;D) in those areas covered in Part II of this BAA. The government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this announcement.</p>
<p>This BAA establishes a four-step process for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA. This sequence allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to CDC and projected funding.

Both of the capabilities (comprehensive and accurate proactive hunting for the existence of malicious actors operating in the GPO computer network; and enhanced and more thorough IT Security incident response investigations) are federal IT security requirements and standards of due care. Existing GPO technology does not include network tap technology which is a gap and constaint to these&nbsp;capabilities described above (comprehensive. effective and thorough proactive hunting for malicious actors and incident response investigations).<br /><br />The SOW also entails the delivery of: 1) hardware, software and liciensing to GPO; 2) professional services to assist GPO technical staff in the installation, configuration and production activation of the new hardware and software, and 3) training for five(5) designated GPO technical staff on the new product for network tap technology.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;">Notice of Intent</div>
<p>The Office of Acquisition and Agreement Management (OAAM), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the NIST Laboratories, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Spektra of California, USA, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 for the procurement of a Final Electrical Calibration Bench (FECB).The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) at NIST intends to procure the required FECB under a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items (FAR Parts 12 and 13).</p>
<p>The NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) has a need for a Final Electrical Calibration Bench (FECB) for existing Spektra Primary Vibration Calibration System (PVCS), model CS18P VLF/HF, to allow direct calibration of all internal elements of the Primary Vibration Calibration System (PVCS) at NIST, and also allow uploading of the NIST calibrated values for use by the system software to streamline calibration workflow.</p>
<p>The Spektra PVCS was acquired and installed at NIST in 2014.  Since August 2015, the PVCS has been used for accelerometer calibrations for the NIST Vibration Calibration Service; the Final Electrical Calibration Bench (FECB) allows National Metrology Institutes (NMI) users of the Spektra PVCS to fully calibrate and verify the electronics package of their systems in-house, as well as to update the software with correction values for the measurement. In order for NIST PML to achieve full traceability for the PVCS using internal NIST standards, it is necessary to acquire a FECB instrument.</p>
<p>Due to proprietary code in the PVCS, Spektra is the only provider of an FECB capable of verifying the performance of all elements of the electronics package of the PVCS.  Spektra is also the only provider whose system can provide NIST-traceable correction values that can be uploaded to the Spektra-proprietary PVCS software to streamline the calibration workflow.</p>
<p>Spektra is the sole source provider for the required FECB and is the only vendor able to provide the FECB that meet the Government's minimum requirements which makes them uniquely qualified. <br /> <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by April 4, 2018 at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT (PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR A NON-COMPETITIVE ACTION):
<p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Rwanda intends to make a sole source award of $843,000 to RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. The purpose of the award is to increase the total estimated cost of an existing $24,582,958 contract with RTI to provide services under the Private Sector Driven Agricultural Growth activity in Rwanda. RTI will deliver the services by the end date of the existing contract: August 30, 2019. The original contract period of performance will not change. RTI has developed a very successful program delivering assistance to the Government of Rwanda to increase private sector investment in Rwanda, which is Objective 1 under Section C.3 of existing contract AID-696-C-14-00002. This increase to the total estimated cost of the contract will allow RTI to deliver additional assistance to the Government of Rwanda to increase private sector investment, as specified in the original contract.</p>
<p>The regulatory authority permitting this award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(a)(2), Impairment of Foreign Aid Programs, which states that full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation. Specifically, AIDAR 706.302-70(b)5) applies in this case, allowing exception to fair and open competition: "An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays."</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Please refer any questions to Zachary Clarke, Contracting Officer at zclarke@usaid.gov or Lindsay Windsor, Acquisition and Assistance Advisor, at lwindsor@usaid.gov.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Description:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Branch of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) focuses on the development of new drugs to prevent and treat malaria, leishmaniosis, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and other infectious disease threats to US Service members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ET branch is currently developing anti-malarial drugs to address current and projected unmet medical needs including a long-term prophylactic regimen for malaria prevention. Drug discovery and development research is attempting to develop anti-malaria prophylactic drug infused implantable matrices that have sustained release. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The combination of atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone&reg;) and doxycycline are the only FDA-approved prophylactic drugs for malaria prevention. Because of the relatively short half-lives of the drugs, successful prevention of malaria is highly dependent on compliance with a daily oral dosing regimen. The FDA approved long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura, is a matrix of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) which is readily available to modify this drug administration schedule. By incorporating long term release of FDA-approved antimalarial drugs in a drug matrix of EVA, drug rods can be implanted in service members, which frees the deployed service members from adhering to a daily oral drug dosing schedule and should protect from malaria for the entire deployment after implant insertion. Thus, the combination of atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline in subdermal implant form will be tested for long-term prophylactic efficacy to replace the current orally administered drug regimens.</span></p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 -- EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014):</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive acquisition in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. Evaluation of quotes will be conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Solicitation Requirements. All quotes submitted will be reviewed for completeness to determine if they contain all information requested in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1. Quotes that are incomplete or missing information may be excluded from the evaluation. Quotes that comply with the solicitation requirements will be considered responsive and evaluated as shown below:<br />a) Price Evaluation. Quotes will be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The unit price of the vendor's quote shall control any conflict between the unit price and the extended amount submitted in response to this solicitation. No advantage will accrue to a vendor who quotes an unrealistically low price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b) Meeting or exceeding the salient characteristics (Pass/Fail basis)</p>
<p>c) Past Performance: <br />(i) Past performance will be evaluated IAW DFARS 252.213-7000, Notice to Prospective Suppliers on Use of Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting in Past Performance Evaluations (June 2015) and IAW FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(A) "the contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired.".</p>
<p>(ii) PPIRS-SR collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier's performance history. The PPIRS-SR application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance. The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in PPIRS-SR will be used by the Contracting Officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired. In the case of a supplier without a record of past performance history in PPIRS-SR, the supplier may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for its past performance history. The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>(iii) PPIRS-SR classifications are generated monthly for each contractor and can be reviewed by following the access instructions in the PPIRS-SR User's Manual found at https://www.ppirs.gov/pdf/PPIRS-SR_UserMan.pdf. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications only. Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications.</p>
<p>2. If the lowest price quote passes technically and the quoter has either a favorable or neutral rating in PPIRS-SR, that quote represents the best value for the Government, and the evaluation process shall stop at this point. An award will be based on a best value of price and past performance provided by responsive and technically acceptable quotes. An award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quotes. The evaluation process will continue in this manner until a vendor's quote passes the technical evaluation and has a favorable or neutral past performance rating. If no quotes are considered technically acceptable or all quoters have an unfavorable past performance rating, the solicitation may be canceled.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Chest Tube Drainage Systems. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MP-1705-31_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems are eligible for participation. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong> <br /><br />These Chest Tube Drainage Systems products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MP -1705-31_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 22 May 2018. Among vendors who are on QSL MP-1705-31_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. </strong><strong>The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Chest Tube Drainage Systems.<br /></strong><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chest Tube Drainage Systems. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $716,721.55 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MP-1705-31_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. The best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. An IA will only be issued once the Vendor has established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line. Failure to establish approved DAPA base uncommitted prices will preclude a vendor from establishing an IA with the government. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br />1. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units /<br />1.

CHEST TUBE DRAINAGE SYSTEM, WATER SEAL, WET SUCTION WITH SINGLE COLLECTION BLOOD CHAMBER, AUTOTRANSFUSION ATTACHED OR ENCLOSED, 2500 ML CAPACITY /<br /><br />3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs, and factor PV costs into their offered IA tier pricing.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO Pacific Clinical Analyst, Ms. Tammie Morton, 808-433-7985, tammie.w.morton.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO Pacific Team Leader, Mr. Paul Davis, 808-433-3686, paul.j.davis.ctr@mail.mil.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<CONTACT>Joseph M. Jarocki, Sr. Procurement Administrator, Phone 6308408303, Email jjarocki@fnal.gov
<DESC>Under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA) is planning to construct the Integrated Engineering Research Center (IERC), an office and laboratory building that will provide state-of-the-art work space for engineers and technicians supporting the next generation of particle physics experiments. The IERC building will be constructed immediately adjacent and connected to Wilson Hall, the iconic 16-story main office building on site.<br />The IERC will transform Fermilab's core capability in particle physics by providing modernized infrastructure as well as a collaborative environment with laboratory and technical team spaces. It provides the interdisciplinary environment necessary to support major initiatives in particle physics established by the DOE Office of Science (DOE-SC). The IERC building will provide laboratory, office, and technical space for engineers working on particle physics detector R&amp;D and detector construction for DOE projects. The laboratory space is central to the design of the building. Shared user space will integrate engineering and technical work on detector R&amp;D with scientific particle physics research by providing space that facilitates collaboration among scientists, engineers, and technicians. A laboratory strategic objective is to revitalize workplace productivity by providing space that will enable interdisciplinary collaboration among laboratory employees and the scientific user community.<br />To construct the IERC, FRA intends to procure Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) services through a competitive, best value procurement. The IERC CM/GC work will be broken down into a base scope and two options. Note that this project is contingent on approval and funding through DOE and any dates shown are subject to change.<br />During the Base Scope of work, the CM/GC will provide pre-construction support services to the IERC project team and the A/E, including input regarding the selection of materials, building systems and equipment, construction feasibility, logistics management, value engineering, and factors related to construction, plus cost estimates and schedules, including estimates of alternative designs or materials. The CM/GC will also provide recommendations of actions designed to minimize adverse effects of labor or material shortages, and time requirements for procurement and installation through construction completion.<br />During Options 1 and 2, the CM/GC will manage and execute construction of the IERC site and building, including site access control, demolition of existing parking lots, excavation, utility removal / placement, building foundation / superstructure, and interior outfitting. <br />The IERC project currently expects to begin final design in February 2019, which will coincide with the start of CM/GC pre-construction services. The anticipated subcontract value is $56,000,000, including all options and tasks. Proposals for this solicitation will include CM/GC pre-construction services and CM professional services. Pricing for the construction work will be broken into trade packages which will be solicited after design work is completed. <br /><br /><strong>TO RECEIVE THE RFP PACKAGE SEND YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION TO JOSEPH JAROCKI AT </strong><a href="mailto:jjarocki@fnal.gov"><strong>jjarocki@fnal.gov</strong></a><strong>.</strong>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to provide services, equipment, and labor necessary for maintaining or restoring animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Central Coast Ranger District - Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.  The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees.  Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments.<br />Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery.  Treatment methods can include machine mowing, track mowing, and handwork.  Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a tractor mower on wheels or tracks (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.).  Tracked mowing is generally required where terrain or slope of the meadow or access into is such that tracks may be necessary to access or complete the mowing.  Handwork is used where machinery does not have access.<br />The amount of effort needed to control unwanted vegetation varies by site.  SEE DETAILED UNIT INFORMATION SHEET (DUIS) FOR SITE SPECIFIC TREATMENT NEEDS, and SEE PROJECT AREA MAPS FOR WORK SITE LOCATIONS. For this solicitation the government expects 145 acres of tractor mowing (tracks optional), 32 acres of mowing with tracks required on equipment, and 2.5 acres of handwork. <br />The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, supplies, (unless specified elsewhere as Government-furnished) and incidentals required to accomplish the work.<br />

The expander should have an integral "injection port" that allows for simplified and more convenient expansion. Offerors shall provide at a minimum a 30mm port.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical<br />Past Performance<br />Price</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are greater in importance than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.
