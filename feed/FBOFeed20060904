<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI); no solicitation document exists.  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) published Federal Information Processing Standard 197 (FIPS-197) specifying the new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm.  This standard specifies that all sensitive but unclassified information will use NIST certified AES products for Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) communications.  As a result of this publication, NIST withdrew FIPS-46-3 Data Encryption Standard (DES) on May 19, 2005, and has encouraged all federal agencies to transition to the AES algorithm by May 2007.  While most agencies have started the transition from DES in numerous communications platforms and systems, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other government agencies currently are unable to complete transition planning strategies for the High Frequency (HF) communications platforms due to the non-availability of a suitable product.   DHS is seeking information to identify potential vendors and the availability of equipment capable of providing HF capabilities with AES encryption.  Specifically, the (DHS) Wireless Management Office (WMO) is seeking information concerning NIST FIPS-197 compliant AES capability in existing HF systems and platforms.   The objective of this RFI is to assist the government in defining a cost effective and operationally efficient plan to transition from the current DES to AES in HF equipment that is operated in fixed infrastructure, mobile platforms, airborn platforms and water vessels.  The following information is desired concerning equipment: availability; capability; compatibility (backwards compatible); form, fit and function (i.e. size, mounting, panel, display); and maintenance and service support.  Respondents should provide information that supports the existence or development of a NIST Certified AES unit, in particular, that provides the following Type III encryption requirements:  provide encryption using the FIPS?197 AES; provide both private and clear voice communications; storage capability of at least eight (8) private keys; capable of generating a public key (two units generate a unique usable key); provide 2400 and 1200 Baud Mixed-Excitation Linear Predictive (MELP) speech compression algorithm with less than 1 second delay; capable of Over-the-Air-Rekeying (OTAR); certified to operate on airborne platforms; capability to operate on various marine and mobile platforms; operationally compatible with  Rockwell-Collins HF systems, MICOM HF systems, and CODAN HF systems; provide data encryption for serial data up to at least 4800 baud; key selection display; compatibility of display with use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG).  Respondents are requested to submit information electronically to john.ziu@dhs.gov or via mail to the following address:  Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations (ITAC), Attn:  John Ziu, 245 Murray Drive, Building 410, Washington, DC 20528.

<DESC>The following are answers to prospective offerors:

Q1. Pertaining to the fenders:  Most of the fenders that are presently installed have suitable swivels that are working.  There are some that are installed that will need attention.  Most of the fenders that are on shore and out of the water have swivels that are missing and or broken or corroded.  The internal torsion member between the two swivels is also missing or broken on most of the fenders out of the water. Do fenders have to be restored to the manufacturer's specifications?  According to the manufacturer's representative, without the torsion member installed the fender will flatten out if pressed hard enough

Answer : KTR will not install the fenders with missing swivel nor will the KTR procure swivels to repair/replace missing ones. Government will provide the fender body along with the necessary hardware attachments affixed to the body up to the swivels. Prospective bidders shall concentrate on the repair of hardwares connected from the wharf (concrete bulkhead) to the shackles connecting to the swivels. 

Q2. Pertaining to the docks:  The given dimensions are 14? x 20?.
How much weight should the docks be able to support?  Do you plan on keeping any marine equipment stored on the docks?

Answer: UFC 4-152-07N Design: Small Craft Berthing Facilities which was referenced in the SOW provides the design and construction criteria for small craft berthing.
