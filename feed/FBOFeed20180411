Only C2Logix, Inc., can provide the services due to the proprietary nature of the software and licenses. <br />This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. No solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can meet the requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within two (2) business days of publication of this notice.

<RESPDATE>042318
<CONTACT>Sarah Turner, Email KWP9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Qiagen, Inc. for the purchase of a Rotor-Gene Q 6plex instrument. One of these instruments is currently in use by the MDTL team for diagnosis of sexual transmitted infections; a second instrument is needed and will be used for the validation for the current MAGNUM Mycoplasma genitalium study items. <br />This instrument is also intended for usage in later projects involving Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV). The current in house assay (for STI) used by the MDTL team works only with the Rotor Gene platform of instruments. No other instrument can be used because the laboratory must maintain valid, reliable, and reproducible results. Without valid results, existing research would be jeopardized because data from an incompatible system would not be directly comparable or consistent with data that has been collected and analyzed over time. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, all quotations/responses received within ten (10) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist Sarah Turner at kwp9@cdc.gov by 23 April 2018 by 10:00 a.m.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong></span><br />The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Hopewell Designs, Inc. (HDI), 5940 Gateway Drive, Alpharetta, GA 30004 for the purchase of an X-ray irradiator control data acquisition and x-ray generating system. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>NIST's Dosimetry Group has a requirement to replace and upgrade an existing NIST Hopewell Design (HDI) x-ray irradiator control data acquisition and x-ray generating system for the 300 kv, 100 kV and mammography system. The resulting air-kerma calculation shall exactly duplicate the air-kerma calculations except in cases where an improvement is possible. Through research interactions and a working knowledge of similar national and international calibration facilities to the NIST x-ray facility it is known that HDI is the only company that can provide the complete requirement and be compatible with the existing system. The following elements of the requirements can only be fulfilled by HDI. The new HDI control system shall have the identical features to the previous proprietary HDI system using Labview and Access for data manipulation of all collected data and equipment. The stored data is part of NIST's quality system so continuity is required. The system shall work with the NIST interlock system, designed by HDI, for radiation safety with enough documentation and adaptability to be used in the new NIST x-ray range, meeting or exceeding guidelines and regulations found in ANSI Standards N43.3 and the requirements of the NIST Health Physics staff. The new system must communicate with the current NIST x-ray generators, controllers, data collection instruments and mammography shutter system and the replacements in the same way as the present HDI system does. HDI designs the exact type of customized and integrated shutter-timing-filter/aperture wheel control mechanisms tube shielding stands for the 100 kV and the 300 kV systems needed by NIST to incorporate the NIST high purity beam filters and apertures. The new HDI x-ray control system must communicate with all the existing NIST equipment as was done with the previous HDI system. HDI does not provide the system through any resellers, so there is only one responsible vendor.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on April 20, 2018. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to divya.langhnoja@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire services pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed acquisition will provide Center for Information Warfare Training (CIWT) Pensacola, FL with support for its Navy  and  Marine Corps Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) Programs (collectively referred to as DON COOL). CIWT requires continued development and refreshing of its current COOL websites, and underlying database, in order to provide users (Service members, credentialing agencies, employers, academia, and Government agencies) with up-to-date analysis and credentialing information.
 COOL provides access to voluntary  and  mandatory credentialing opportunities, civilian crosswalks, employment leads, and other recruiting, retention and transition information via a centralized, web-based hub that consolidates information from numerous sources on certifications, licenses, apprenticeships that correspond with each Navy rating, USMC MOS, job and occupation and provides funding for DON personnel to obtain these licenses and certifications.  

The proposed acquisition is for services which the Navy intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Solutions for Information Design (SOLID) LLC of Fairfax Station, VA, the incumbent provider under current purchase order N0018914PZ689, is considered the only source with the necessary institutional knowledge, technical expertise, and personnel resources to provide the required services.
 All other responsible sources may submit concise documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services. 

The acquisition will be conducted under the provisions for commercial items in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. A firm fixed price sole source contract is anticipated to satisfy this requirement. The anticipated base period of performance for this action will be 12 months, starting 01 October 2018 through 30 September 2019. Four (4) twelve month option periods will be included as a means of fulfilling anticipated CIWT requirements through 30 September 2023. 

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Navy not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Navy.
 Furthermore, no award will be made on the basis of information received in response to this notice and the Navy will not pay for any information provided. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not competitive procurement is a possibility. 

If no affirmative written responses advantageous to the Navy are received within fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this notice, SOLID will be solicited to provide the required services. If this procurement were competed, no additional synopsis would be published and the solicitation document would only be forwarded to the intended vendor and firms that responded to this synopsis. All submissions are required to be submitted via e-mail to michael.placido@navy.mil.
