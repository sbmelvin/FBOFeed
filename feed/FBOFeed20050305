<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes.     This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     

GENERAL INTENT

The Multi-National Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) contracting office at Camp Victory South, Iraq needs information on contractors that have the demonstrated capability to implement cell phone roaming agreements and provide carrier interconnect services.  The objective is to establish service in the form of one-way roaming and interconnect agreements with several telecommunications companies in Iraq.  These services will provide expanded connectivity to users of US Government (USG) GSM cell phone services, and USG wired phones in the Iraq AOR, to reduce costs, improve call quality and quantity for MNF-I forces throughout the Iraq AOR.

The primary focus of this request is to help identify a contractor that can provide:
1.	Scaleable, integrated, interconnects for Primary Rate services between the USG Avaya switch located at the USG Embassy Annex (Baghdad, Iraq), the Iraq Telephone and Postal Company (ITPC), and with the three largest Cellular Carriers in Iraq (Iraqna, AsiaCell and Atheer).
2.	One-way Roaming agreements to enable USG GSM cell phone users to roam on the networks of the three largest Cellular Carriers in Iraq (Iraqna, AsiaCell and Atheer). 

The goal is to secure a service that will establish interconnect and roaming agreements with the aforementioned carriers to expand the calling capabilities of MNF-I personnel throughout the country using both GSM Cell phones and wired telephones. This capability is needed to reduce the number and costs of International calls made within Iraq.  The contractor shall provide for the procurement, management, implementation, installation, configuration, maintenance, and detailed billing to operate both Roaming and Interconnect capabilities.
    
This RFI provides interested contractors an opportunity to present to the government their ideas, an approach, and capabilities to interconnect with the aforementioned carriers.  Responders that demonstrate the needed capabilities will be entered into a sources database and given the opportunity to compete on any future request for quote or request for proposal that results from this request for information.     

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION

Responses to this request must be received by the Government no later than close of business 2:00pm PST 10 Mar 05.     Responders shall provide one electronic copy (Microsoft Word or .pdf formats ) ten pages or less.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper with information on it.     Minimum print size is 10 point type, or 12 pitch.     If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then those pages should be marked accordingly.

Interested parties who have the capabilities to meet this need are asked to respond to SMSgt Michael Lemke via email at Michael.Lemke@iraq.centcom.mil with the time line and point of contact to include phone number and email address on or before 2:00pm PST 10 Mar 05.
