<DESC>This notice is being prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Subpart 5.203 for commercially available services.  This announcement is not the formal solicitation and the expected posting date of the full solicitation package is on or about April 27, 2009 with a response date of May 14, 2009.
The solicitation will be inclusive of a a request for competitive quotes, and will be advertised as full and open competition under NAISC: 541710 and Product service Code: R499.
Project Overview:The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, is preparing to issue solicitation for Big Game Harvest Survey collection and reporting within Alaska's Game Management Unit 18.  Accurate estimates of large mammal subsistence harvests by residents of Unit 18 communities in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta region of western Alaska are an important management tool.  However, few systematic surveys have been conducted in this region, and the baseline data that do exist for a few communities is dated and sporadic.  This project would begin to address the need for accurate harvest estimates for big game species.  Accurate harvest estimates contribute to sound conservation and management of resources, which benefits all users, both privately and Govenrment-wide.
Work Description:This project will require a professional contractor to conduct systematic household surveys of big game subsistence harvests in the Lower Yukon communities of Russian Mission, Marshall, Saint Marys, Mountain Village, Alakanuk, and Nunam Iqua, as well as in the communities of Kotlik, Scammon Bay, and Chevak where residents also hunt moose in the Lower Yukon River region.  All areas are within the State of Alaska.  The proposed 9 communities, based on US 2000 Census, represent an estimated 4,500 people and 1,035 occupied households. This project will result in community harvest estimates of big game (moose, caribou, bears, and wolves) harvests and descriptions of harvest location information to support sustainable wildlife management decision making. 
The contractor will provide the following services and products under the terms of the proposed statement of work:
1)	A report summarizing all findings submitted to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7-Alaska, Office                 of Subsistence Management by no later than February 28, 2010.   

The solicitation package will outline the specific period of performance dates of this requirement, and the anticipated award will be inclusive of a Base Period of approximately 10 months.
Interested parties wishing to respond to the forthcoming solicitation are encouraged to visit www.fbo.gov often and download related solicitation information.  Vendors wishing to respond to this announcement may contact the contracting officer listed within this announcement by calling (907) 786-3408, or send a written request noting solicitation No. 70181-9-Q214, via fax to (907) 786-3923.

<DESC><BR>Description:  PEO STRI Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Assistant Product Manager (APM) for Live Training Transformation (LT2) Consolidated Product-Line Management (CPM) approach focuses on the requirements, execution, and management for the synchronization of a multi-phased, multi-thread Product Line.<BR><BR>CPM is the framework by which Product Managers (PdM) will execute control of a systems life cycle to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based.  CPM is the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of PM products.  It enables managers to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems for which they are responsible throughout the life cycle of that system.   <BR><BR>The process by which PM TRADE manages products must be deliberate, disciplined and coordinated in order to maximize re-use of components and products in the development of new systems, synchronize the production of products to gain efficiencies, facilitates technology refresh and obsolescence/retrofit efforts, enable supporting efforts, and to maintain seamless interoperability between components, products and systems.  <BR><BR>CPM provides LT2 the mechanisms and processes to achieve a holistic consolidated approach to managing disparate products and elements within the product line.  CPM provides the means for development, integration, and sustainment.  CPM is the life-cycle implementation mechanism for LT2. (Refer to Appendix C, CPM Core Functionalities, of Attachment A, Draft Statement of Work, for functions included within the CPM scope)<BR><BR><BR>1.  The anticipated nature and complexity of the work tasks  (ranging from software development to product line configuration management) associated with the CPM requires mature and established processes; and therefore a level 4 CMMI rating. (Refer to Attachment A for a Draft copy of the Statement of Work)<BR><BR>2.  Security Requirements regarding software development and potential access to secure information will limit the CPM effort to US companies/citizens only.<BR><BR>3.  The intent of this Market Research is to:<BR>a.	Determine which companies may have potential interest in competing for the CPM effort.<BR>b.	Determine whether or not the CPM functionality already exists via COTS/NDI solutions. <BR>c.	Solicit comments and feedback from industry regarding the draft/initial requirements and capabilities being sought for CPM, including opinions on the viability of the approach and strategy.<BR>d.	Solicit brief capabilities statements from interested parties regarding these high level requirements.<BR><BR>4.  Companies/contractors electing to respond to this Request for Information/Market research should contact Caron Rigali, Contract Specialist by electronic mail at caron.rigali@us.army.mil with their responses not later than 12 January 2009.  The Market Research responses shall not exceed four (4) pages inclusive of the cover sheet. This is not a request for proposal.  No additional information is available at this time.  Companies/contractors with questions should contact Ms Caron Rigali.<BR><BR>Note: In response to item 3.a  Companies/contractors are requested to indicate if they are a large or small business (if small, please indicate any applicable socio-economic status), if they are interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, and if they are planning to team with other companies for this contract.<BR><BR>Contracts POC:	Caron Rigali, (407) 380-4987, caron.rigali@us.army.mil Technical POC:	Brian Kemper, (407) 384-3816, brian.e.kemper@us.army.mil<BR>Approval Status:	<BR>Attachments:  <BR>A.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is 09-233-SOL-00050 , and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is  541690.   This requirement is solicited under full and open competition. This acquisition is being conducted using Part 12 and Part 15  of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated. It is the intent of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Public Health and Safety (OPHS), Blood Safety and Availability to acquire a survey of United States civilian hospitals and blood collection centers (approx 3,000 institutions), including hospitals that operate their own blood collection services and cellular and tissue therapies. The survey shall provide comprehensive data on blood collection, utilization and safety related practices throughout the industry.
The survey results shall be used by the contractor to prepare a comprehensive report: National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) for 2009.
The 2009 NBCUS project consists of two parts.
Part 1: The survey instrument (including data elements), data sampling scheme and stakeholder pool is complete as of December 2008 and ready for use.  Part 1 scope is not included in this solicitation (it is complete).
Part 2: Conducting the survey, analyzing survey responses, survey response tabulation, and preparing a comprehensive 2009 NBCUS survey report are the requirements of the current solicitation and consist of the following tasks:
1.  Meet with Project Officer (PO)/Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative
     (COTR) and HHS stakeholders to develop a Project Management Plan.
2. Conduct the survey, including appropriate follow-up with participants, (e.g., repeat mailing/email solicitation, appropriate customer-service phone calls, reminder ads in industry periodicals).  A web-based survey tool is optional using appropriate industry practices (e.g., safeguards, aesthetics, and usability).  Whether paper-based or web-based, or both, and appropriate survey control and tracking system shall be employed.
3. Analyze survey responses for completeness and accuracy and prepare two statistically valid data sets of the final survey results (one that is institution level and secure/proprietary to each participant, the other a “scrubbed” de-identified data set that is public accessible), including the following tasks: data preparation, develop coding scheme, code data, manually edit data to ensure accuracy, verification of data, key coded information, and edit programs and data as appropriate for final analysis. 
4.	Delivery of basic survey response tabulation, including: statistical weighing, imputation, non-response bias analysis, estimation and variance estimations, data sets, analysis of data sets, and delivery of data sets (de-identified)
5.	Prepare comprehensive 2009 NBCUS survey report including appropriate examination of industry trends and identification of significant new findings.  The report preparation shall include appropriate peer-review analysis (i.e., 2 to 3 subject matter experts).  This report is destined for public consumption (e.g, no facility identifiable data) and the 2007 NBCUS report, which may be used as an example, can be found at www.hhs.gov/bloodsafety 
6.	Prepare monthly progress reports to include project plans, progress towards deliverable completion, basic/gross funding utilization, significant difficulties, and other significant findings related to project completion
