<DESC>The F-16 Support Group at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), GHBK, plans to issue a solicitation and conduct a competitive source selection under Full and Open Competition for F-16 Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Depot Services Support. No set-aside is contemplated but NAICS Code 336411 applies. A 4 year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) ordering contract is contemplated to accommodate applicable annual Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) appropriations. The total period of ordering for the proposed contract is from 01 Oct 2012 through 30 Sep 2016 (FY16). The four (4) 12-month periods within this timeframe are described on separately priced line items. A single option, describing a period of 6 months of support will also be priced to support contingency if the anticipated follow-on source selection for this requirement is delayed, (see the FAR clause at 52.217-8, which will be included). <br />This program defines core Depot Maintenance (scheduled) activities which will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and other support defined separately, for which a Fixed Rate agreement, including fully loaded composite (wrap) rates, will be priced. The intent of the core activity support is to provide a facility for induction of aircraft currently in service with operational units of the 5th and 7th Air Force in Korea and Japan and needing scheduled (known) and unscheduled depot maintenance. Over and above effort, implementation of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), Contractor Field Team (CFT) support, and some lesser modification efforts, e.g., FS 341 lower bulkhead repair or replacement, and other minor upgrades will also be required. For efficiency of PACAF resources support, the place of performance must be located within either the 5th AF or 7th AF Area of Responsibility (Korea or Japan). Schedule impacts and costs incurred by PACAF as a result of distance and other factors derived from the actual location of the proposed facility will be evaluated. The prospective effort is to be priced, evaluated and paid by the Government in U.S. Dollars. Site surveys to assess capability at proposed sites may be conducted. <br />This notice is for a requirement that is being developed in accordance with information from on-going market research and pre-solicitation activities and is subject to revision. Comment from interested sources is invited. An "Industry Days" conference may be scheduled for the January 2012 timeframe and held at Hill AFB in conjunction with these exchanges. A more detailed description of the requirement is in the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) attached to this notice. A more complete package of documentation and representation of the solicitation, to include draft model contract with line item structure, terms and conditions, and clauses will be provided in subsequent amendments to this notice leading to the Agency release of the official Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement on or about 1 Feb 2012. <br />The Agency reserves the right to release after that date. The Agency reserves the right to cancel or revise this notice at any time. The Agency also reserves the right to make contract award pending availability of funding, in accordance with FAR 52.232-18. There are no known Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) associated with this requirement in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 and 9.507-1.<br />Mr. Kevin Flinders, OO-ALC/PKC, Hill AFB UT 84056, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process, and therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Flinders can be reached at (801) 777-6549, email: Kevin.Flinders@hill.af.mil <br />Responses to this notice must be received in the office from which this notice originates no later than 1400 Hours, Mountain Standard Time, 15 Dec 2011. The point of contact for this requirement is the Contracting Officer, Lance S Hardman, phone (801) 777-6878. The buyer, Darin Barnes, may also be contacted at (801) 586-0366.

<CONTACT>Erin L. Orthmeyer, Phone 3106539679, Email Erin.Orthmeyer.ctr@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>TO: ALL Potential Respondents</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information on Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Technology Insertion Opportunities for Future Sensors</p>
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning (XR), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is requesting information for relevant technology developments for OPIR components and subsystems needed to support technology insertion opportunities and enhancements for future OPIR sensors. This request is another element of ongoing market research to define potential materiel solutions to support Department of Defense (DoD) and National Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) initiatives. This market research is in direct support of the Joint OPIR Integrated Space Trade (JOIST) study being co-led by the Executive Agent for Space and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Developmental Planning Division is soliciting for inputs on development projects. Please note: An Industry Day was held at the end of September 2011 in support of this same study effort that solicited information onwhole sensor technologies, constellations, and architecture alternatives; as described in Solicitation 11-84. Responses to that solicitation should not be resubmitted.</p>
<p>2. The focus of this effort is to identify advanced technologies that are either: <br />1) at TRL/MRL levels (5 to 7 +) which could be sufficiently matured for incorporation into the next generation of OPIR system designs slated for launch from 2017-2022, or <br />2) at TRL/MRL levels (3 to 5) that could be matured and incorporated into OPIR system designs that would be launched from 2022-2030.<br />Interested respondents should provide relevant materials to summarize the technology, its maturity, how it will contribute to future OPIR systems/applications and address capabilities defined in the OPIR Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document (lCD). Specifically, the Government would like to understand the potential technologies, current TRL and MRL, space qualification needs, and what R&amp;D investment would be necessary to mature the technology to at least a TRL and MRL of 6 in two-to-five years.</p>
<p>3. Specific areas of focus include:</p>
<p>a) Advanced OPIR Component Technologies. OPIR component technologies of interest are meant to improve or replace a component, collection of components, or subsystem in an OPIR sensor design concept which may or may not have been realized to date in an actual system. Examples include focal plane arrays (FPA), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), cryocoolers, optical materials (rad hard glasses, filters, optical coatings), line of sight (LOS) stabilization technologies such as fiber optic gyros, fine steering mirrors, inertial reference unit (IRU) techniques, radiation resistant and radiation hardened optics, electronics, processors, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), on-orbit processing (processors, algorithms), innovative exploitation of OPIR phenomenology, and thermal control.<br />b) Space vehicle technologies/components/subsystems applicable to OPIR sensors. Space vehicle technologies/components/subsystems are technologies that cover the gamut of components and subsystems needed to support a space-based OPIR sensor and might address the need for light weight structures, power, propulsion, data recording, internal communications, pointing &amp; tracking, and so forth.<br />c) Space-to-ground communications hardware. software and algorithms that address OPIR data transfer. Space-to-ground communications technologies address the cost of processing, compressing, encrypting and transmitting OPIR wideband data as well as assure downlink robustness</p>
<p>The Government encourages respondents to leverage analysis and work conducted in previous OPIR efforts. All materials must be properly marked to identify specific proprietary or export controlled material information. Materials may be classified up to the SCI level. Please submit classified materials through the classified network included with the POC information. All unclassified materials can be sent through regular e-mail. Contact the POC if you require special arrangements to submit classified responses.</p>
<p>4. To facilitate evaluation, SMC/XR requests interested industry respondents to complete a template describing their proposed technologies and submit no more than 30 pages. Contact the SMC/XR POC listed below to obtain an electronic copy of the template. Please provide contractual and technical points of contact including phone numbers and email addresses.</p>
<p><br />Response Information<br />This request is for industry market research, budgetary and planning estimation purposes only. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this market survey or responses received. The Government intends to use Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and National Laboratory (NL) support to assist in the review of the materials. All Government, FFRDC, SETA, UARC and NL personnel will sign appropriate non-disclosure forms. <br />Please be advised that the Government will not pay for costs associated with the preparation of the requested materials. The Government may contact a respondent for more information or clarification purposes. The Government does not commit to contacting a respondent or providing any feedback on a response. Respondents to this request should stipulate any assumptions used in the development of their presentation. No extensions to the schedule are foreseen. Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged.<br />This RFI is unrestricted and encourages responses from all responsible contractors independent of size.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />ROLL-ON, ROLL-OFF OPERATOR STATION</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. CBP is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be via the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Air and Marine (OAM) mission statement is: Protect the American People and Nation's critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of integrated air and marine forces to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States.</p>
<p>Since September 11, 2001, the CBP OAM P-3 mission set has dramatically evolved and grown while its sensor suite capabilities have remained largely static. Generational gaps between current technology and currently installed equipment exist, creating capability shortfalls in mission performance due to maintenance/sustainability issues and operational capabilities. Current aircraft operator stations are becoming increasingly more difficult to sustain due to reduced vendor support for significantly dated equipment and are not capable of taking advantage of upgrades featured on later sensor models. This directly affects the P-3's ability to reliably respond to required tasking and maintain high-tempo mission performance. Older interface design and extensive modification over the long term to incorporate new mission requirements have taxed the processing capability of the mission computer system to its limits. This demands increased operator workload and can lead to task-saturation. This can potentially reduce the domain awareness capability of the aircraft and adversely affect the quality of information provided to supported agencies, as well as reduce safety margins for not only the P-3, but aircraft and vessels it is directly supporting.</p>
<p>In order to improve the mission capability of the P-3 platform current operator stations need to be modernized, and additional capabilities added. Operator station modernization would introduce critical upgrades in hardware performance, reliability, and support, as well as improve sensor mission performance and operator interface. The ability to take only the necessary operators stations during a mission will increase the range and endurance on the aircraft, improving operations performance. Additionally, it will allow CBP OAM to share stations among multiple aircraft, making more effective use of each and allow for easy replacement of stations as new technologies develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.0 REQUEST:</p>
<p>CBP is seeking information on commercially available Roll-On/Roll-off operator stations that could be configured to satisfy all or a large portion of the desired capabilities stated below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) Functional Defeat
<SOLNBR>RWK-RFI-12-0001

<CONTACT>MiMi Martin, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-883-2675, Fax 850-882-9599, Email mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information<br /><br />Introduction<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Munitions Directorate is interested in developing far-term plans that may lead to innovative means to functionally defeat well-defended, hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs). The Munitions Directorate, with support from other AFRL Directorates, such as Directed Energy and Sensors, seeks to become better acquainted with and better understand innovative concepts and technologies that may be developed and applied over the next twenty (20) years to functionally defeat (deny, disrupt, or destroy) HDBTs. This may also include technologies that could improve HDBT functional assessment leading to a better capability to locate and characterize the targets. The purpose of this Request is to solicit concepts and relevant technology investment areas, assess technical maturity levels, examine top-level development timelines, and begin defining conceptual trade spaces. The requirements are described below:<br /><br />Target Scenario<br />(1) The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek information from all sources on innovative methods to functionally defeat the operation of a well-defended, hardened/deeply buried facility located within an unfriendly country. These innovative methods must be based on emerging technology or on technology that can reasonably be expected to be available by 2031. Emphasis should be placed on concepts/technologies that would functionally defeat such a facility for a given amount of time. Functional Defeat is defined as denial, disruption, or destruction of a facility's ability to accomplish its intended mission for a desired period. It is realized that this time period may not be easily defined. It will depend on the efficacy of the attack solution. Emphasis shall be placed on functional defeat systems that can be delivered to the HDBT or its close vicinity by current or projected delivery platforms. It is understood that some ambiguity must exist about the construction and intended use of the HDBT. For the purpose of this Request, it will be assumed that the HDBT functions as a key command, control, and communication node. Emphasis may be placed on directed energy applications for target location/characterization or for defeat mechanisms, either of which may be delivered to the vicinity of the target by conventional Air Force strike platforms, manned or unmanned. However, it is emphasized that this Request is not intended to pursue information, research, or development in regard to atomic or thermonuclear warheads.
<p>(2) For purposes of this RFI, the HDBT is assumed to be a tunnel complex with two portals built into the base of a granite mountain. The granite over layer is assumed to be 60 meters thick over both portals and 80 meters over the facility's mission space. Metallic blast doors are closed and hermetically sealed at both portals. The two tunnels are assumed to be 100 feet in length with directional turns. The facility is constructed on a single level and occupies between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p>(3) The HDBT makes use of state-of-the-art computers and communication equipment. It is tied to the local electricity grid but has a large capacity diesel generator to produce its electricity when the need arises. The facility draws fresh water from an internal deep well. Sewage is held in holding tanks and removed periodically. All incoming air passes through state-of-the-art biological/chemical filters.</p>
<p>(4) The specifications of this HDBT have been deliberately left vague. Any questions related to subsystem characteristics and capacities may be directed to Ms Pamela Pitchford and Mr. Charles Cottrell (AFRL/RWAS). However, the answers to those hypothetical questions, if provided, may also not be specific. Be aware that all data with regard to this Scenario are notional and do not represent any known target.</p>
<p>Response Requirements<br />The following should be included in any response:<br />1. Describe conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Target Scenario.<br />2. Provide a top-level development schedule, based on the conceptual approach, leading toward the Technology Readiness Levels of 5 or greater.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging near-term technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to address the functional defeat of the HDBT. All technologies or suggested concepts should be available for proof of concept demonstration by the Air Force within the nominal twenty (20) years after the issue of this Request.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government will evaluate the respondent's capabilities based on the following: <br />a) Thorough understanding of the Scenario requirements; b) Identification of conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Scenario; c) Description of the rough magnitude of potential costs to develop the requisite technologies to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or greater; and <br />d) Top-level development schedule. All responses are to include the organization name, address, business point of contact/phone number/email address, and technical point of contact/phone number/email address.<br />Respondents to this RFI should stipulate any assumptions used in the development of their response. The Air Force anticipates that respondents will respond to the information request to the best of their ability with as much of the requested information as time permits by the specified deadline. No extensions to the schedule are foreseen.<br />This RFI is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. The Air Force may contact a respondent for more information or clarification purposes. The Air Force does not commit to contacting a respondent or providing any feedback on a response. The Air Force does not intend to issue any findings or reports outside the Air Force resulting from the RFI. Due to the expedited timeline, questions may be submitted with the RFI response and may be considered in any potential future solicitations. <br />Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil. Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) Functional Defeat. Responses must be received no later than 0800 Central Time on 03 January 2012. For technical questions, please contact Ms. Pamela Pitchford, AFRL/RWAS, pamela.pitchford@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2505, or Mr. Charles Cottrell, AFRL/RWAS, charles.cottrell@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2723.<br /><br />DISTRIBUTION A.

<DESC>This is a sole source requirement to AAI Corporation, 124 Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD 21030 (cage: 97384) to provide Baringa Ultraviolet Missile Warning System Test Sets for the HH-60U aircraft procured by the Operational Loss Replacement (OLR) Program.
<p>The USAF maintains and operates a fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters that are distributed across seven Major Commands (MAJCOMs). These helicopters are used for a variety of missions, including combat search and rescue, infiltration, ex-filtration and re-supply of special operations forces in day, night or marginal weather conditions. The USAF HH-60G is a variant of the Army UH-60A/L model with a number of modifications, including in-flight refueling capability and upgrade modifications to the navigation and communications systems. Due to the aging fleet and aircraft losses in combat, the USAF formed an Operational Loss Replacement (OLR) program to replace HH-60G aircraft. The OLR program acquisition strategy is to acquire Army UH-60M baseline helicopters and modify these aircraft to meet user requirements. The newly assigned Mission Design Series for these modified aircraft will be HH-60U. The Baringa Test Sets are needed to maintain the operational capability of the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) installed on the aircraft. The required Baringa part number is EU00075-03-FG.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing AFGLSC/401 SCMS or its successor organization(s). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), CDRLs, and the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet.
<p>The scope of AFGLSC's enterprise-wide responsibilities includes operating, maintaining, and enhancing COLT and PDL. Because of the highly technical nature of COLT and PDL, AFGLSC needs contractor support to provide the specialized analytical skills necessary to operate, maintain, and enhance COLT and integrate it into the AFGLSC's enterprise-level processes. The Air Force installations where service will be provided may require contractor personnel to travel to these locations.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates the period of performance will be approximately 7 months, beginning in Q1 of CY12. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 10-12 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.

<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.

<a href="mailto:kevin.ctr.lydon@faa.gov">kevin.ctr.lydon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center has a requirement for: Equipment needed to make quantitative surface measurements of fluorescent magnetic particle (MP) indications to support a study the FAA is conducting to understand and improve the magnetic particle inspection method.  The light emitting diode (LED) ring assembly is required for several reasons: the LED will provide instant intensity needed for the imaging to occur eliminating the 30 minute warm up time required by other ultraviolet (UV) sources;  the low amount of heat generated by the LEDs will not affect the camera lens or the assembly; the compact size of the light will accommodate the physical assembly, and finally the LEDs can be positioned in such a fashion as to eliminate "Hot Spots" often associated with conventional UV lights.  The lens filter and camera need to observe the surfaces under test and enhance the resultant images while viewed under UV illumination.

This is an announcement for a Request for Quote (RFQ) for several components needed to make quantitative UV measurements of Magnetic Particle test results at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City, New Jersey.
SCOPE OF WORK
The following equipment and shipping shall be provided for the quantitative UV measurements of Magnetic Particle test results:
Items: 
1.) QTY 1	STC-GEC202A w/ Filter Mod for Viewing UV STC-GEC202A Color GigE Camera 1600 x 1200 with Filter ModificationFor Viewing UV Fluorescence 
2.) QTY 1	HF16SA-1 Lens 
3.) QTY 1	EXT TUBE KIT 51020 & 40MM THICKNESS TUBEExtension Tube Kit 
4.) QTY 1	UV LED Ring Light Assembly UV LED Ring Light Assembly with InstalledThermocouple and Control Unit / Power Supply with TC Display 
5.) QTY 1	10Ft Cable Assembly (Camera, LED, TC)
6.) QTY 1	Freight if any. (Firm fixed-price)
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with a response to the RFQ are solely at the interested vendor's expense.
This procurement will have a dollar threshold between $10,000 and $100,000. Proposals will be reviewed through tiered evaluation selection process. In accordance with AMS policy 3.6.1.3.4 procurements within this dollar threshold will be set a side for SEDB 8 (a).   A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in source selection.  Once offers are received, the CO will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified below.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made with ample competition.
(a) Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) program.(b) Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB);(c) Very small business;(d) Small business; and(e) Other than small business.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334513 for Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables with a size standard of 500 Employees.
Vendors must complete the attached Business Declaration Form and return with quote submittal.
Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) program must submit proof of participation.

<DESC> This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice. Please note that this is not a request for proposal (RFP) or bids and the government is seeking information for market research purposes only. No solicitation document is available and no other information pertaining to project scope, timeline, etc. is available at this time. Any request for assistance with submission or other procedural matters shall be submitted via email only. Additional information about this project will be issued under a different solicitation number of the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov once available.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI is issuing this Sources Sought to identify potential small, bondable, and experienced businesses such as: (1) Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB): (2) Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB); (3) 8(a) contractors, (4) HUBZone Small Businesses, (5) Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), etc, that are capable of meeting this construction requirements and with the required bonding capability. 

This project consists of a 4-level horizontal expansion to the north side of the existing East Parking Structure to serve visitors and staff for a net gain of 307 parking spaces. This additional parking supply will help alleviate the current parking capacity short-fall.  The horizontal expansion to the East Parking Structure will extend approximately 144 feet north of the existing structure by the same width as the existing structure. It will include three supported levels and a grade level that aligns vertically with the existing floors. Access to all levels will be provided through the existing ramping system. The expansion structure bays will align with the 3 bays of the existing structure allowing a convenient extension of the traffic flow along the west and middle bays. The east bay traffic cannot flow straight into the expansion structure due to the existing shear walls along the north elevation that need to remain in place at the lower 3 levels for structural support. At the roof, level where the shear wall is not needed, the traffic flow in the east bay will continue straight north into the expansion structure to provide more efficient traffic flow and to gain additional parking spaces.

All workers on-site must be OSHA certified (at least one competent person must have 30 hour certificate and all other workers, prime and subcontractors, must have 10 hour certificate). Construction time allotted for all work will be 300 calendar days from the receipt of Notice to Proceed. 

In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the magnitude of this construction project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, small business size standard of $33.5M in average annual receipts for the preceding three years.  Interested firms must be registered in ORCA and CCR and qualified as a small business under this NAICS code.  Qualified small business firms (service disabled veteran owned businesses, veteran owned businesses, HubZone firms, Woman Owned, 8a firms, etc) are encouraged to respond. 

The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed two (2) pages. Include the following: 1. Company name, DUNS number, social economic category (small business, SDVOSB, 8(a), etc), address, point of contact, telephone number and email address. 2. Bonding capacity (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars). 3. If available, list the last three Construction projects completed in the last 5 years of similar size and scope to include contract number, award date, dollar value of contract, project location, and point of contact. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. There is no guarantee, expressed or implicit, that market research for this acquisition will result in a particular set-aside or sole source award, or any other guarantee of award or acquisition strategy.

Responses must be received by 3:00 PM EST on December 14, 2011 via email or fax to the Contracting Officer at Aaron.Lacy@va.gov, FAX (260) 460-1335.  PLEASE REFERENCE "SOURCES SOUGHT: Project 506-310 Expand East Parking Structure" IN THE SUBJECT LINE or cover sheet. Email is preferred. Respondents will not be contacted regarding their submission or information gathered as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Interested firms shall be required to respond to additional announcements separately from this announcement without further notice from the Government when posted to the FBO website at http://www.fbo.gov.  The formal solicitation will be issued at a later date by a separate announcement and separate solicitation number on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.  The FBO website is the only official site to obtain these documents.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a solicitation announcement.  The purpose of this Market Research and Source Notice is to determine if qualified Small Business firms are available and capable of responding to this requirement.   The Government intends to limit competition to certified Small Business Caterpillar representatives.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the government in making appropriate acquisition decisions. <br><br>The U. S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, anticipates a procurement to remove the starboard generator of the CHOCTAWHATCHEE (a floating crane), (see below for existing specifications) and replace it with a remanufactured CAT 3306B marine generator or a newly remanufactured Caterpillar generator set of equivalent power within the following range: Caterpillar Generator Set 3306B (170 ekW 213kVa 60Hz @1800 rpm) - (190 ekW 238 kVa 60 Hz @1800 rpm). The CHOCTAWHATCHEE is a floating crane with a king post mounted SeaTrax SeaKing 7200-DR type crane.  It was built in 2003 by Bender Shipyards, Mobile, AL.  Contractor will be required to perform a site visit prior to award of a contract to confirm size conformity to existing space. General characteristics of the crane are:  Length - 165'; Beam - 50', molded depth amidships -11'-6"; and displacement -1,221 long tons.  Due to the current sound and weatherproof enclosures an identical model remanufactured unit is desired and any other model offered must fit inside the existing enclosures and utilize the existing radiators and mounting arrangement.  A Caterpillar remanufactured unit is required to provide interoperability and sharing of common parts and consumables (filters, belts, seals, oils, etc) with the remaining 3306B generator set on board the CHOCTAWHATCHEE.  With a remanufactured 3306B generator set the fuel delivery system, which includes the injection pump, injectors and governor, must be new parts. The contractor will reuse the existing radiator but will have the unit flushed and cleaned per the manufacturer's recommendations.  The contractor will remove and re-install the generator's enclosure and all covers.  Lifting and setting of the enclosure will be made by the Government with a Government crane with proper coordination with the contractor.    <br><br>The contractor will disconnect and re-connect all wiring, fuel lines, etc. and insure that the replacement generator is fully operational.  The crane barge will be operational during this work, therefore the contractor must ensure that the starboard generator is completely disconnected from the barge's main electrical bus to avoid any accidental re-energizing of the work area until the starboard generator is ready for reconnection and testing.  The contractor will insure that the port generator remains operational at all times during the work.   The contractor will perform a load test on the remanufactured or new generator set to ensure it will operate without any detrimental effects to the generator or barge. <br>The contractor will clean up any spills, trash, or debris generated during the work.  <br><br>The following information is provided for the existing generator:<br><br>Engine:  Serial Number 1RS00844  <br>Arangement#185-1239<br>Performance Spec: 0K2319<br>Full Load Static Fuel: 3.99mm<br>Full Torque Static Fuel: 4.19 mm<br>Power:  251 break horse power @1800 RPMs<br><br>Generator Set:  SN 6DG02023  <br>Arrangement #109-3784<br>Engine Model 3306<br>Year 2002<br>218 kva 174KW<br>3 Phase <br><br>Proposed replacement work duration of 8 calendar days. Sources are being sought for small business firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 811310 with a small business Size Standard $7,000,000.00.  <br>The U. S. Army, Corps of Engineers has a crane barge, the CHOCTAWHATCHEE that is equipped with two 174KW CAT 3306B generator sets (1 port and 1 starboard) to provide vessel service and off vessel service power. The generators are located within weatherproof sound dampening enclosures aft of the barge deckhouse/workshop. The enclosures are bolted to the deck and can be removed and lifted with the vessel's crane.<br>Interested Small Business Firms may reply to this Sources Sought announcement and shall provide the following information, which shall not exceed a total of eight pages:  <br>1.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dycoda, LLC for the procurement of technical support in developing, executing, and documenting the MELCOR analysis of the Peach Bottom Unit 3 Spent Fuel Pool (SFP). A scoping study is being performed that combines structural and seismic assessments, more detailed mechanistic modeling of fuel heatup and potential fission product behavior, realistic treatment of offsite emergency preparedness, and the current SFP regulatory requirements. NRC staff is performing MELCOR modeling of the Peach Bottom Unit 3 SFP to support the SFP Scoping Study; however, highly-specialized contractor assistance is required on the MELCOR analyses for the Peach Bottom Unit 3 SFP, to augment the staff's efforts to estimate the effect on SFP accident consequences of a reduced amount of spent nuclear fuel being stored in the SFP. This estimation will be made with a focus on realistic MELCOR analysis. Dycoda, LLC is the only commercially available source that is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work. The estimated period of performance is seven and one half months. This notice is prepared under the authority of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Ashlee Bushell via email at Ashlee.Bushell@nrc.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. EST, on Friday, December 9, 2011. No request for quotation document is available and verbal request will not be honored. Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. No contractual document will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia invites comments and suggestions on the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) for implementation of the Finance and Business Services (FaBS) Project in Ethiopia. FaBS will serve as the mission's flagship private sector project, designed to significantly compliment several other initiatives under the Feed the Future program. A central, guiding principle of FaBS is that the recent ambitious economic growth projections - outlined under the USG-led FtF initiative as well as in Ethiopia's 5 year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) - will require a vibrant, competitive private sector whose need for investment capital can be affordable met by both bank and non-bank intermediaries. In consideration of the role of financial intermediation to achieve sustained economic growth rates in excess of 10% annually over the next five years, the capacity of financial institutions will have to be vastly improved to enable them channel resources from savers to investors in a cost-effective framework, where risk is appropriately priced. At present the Ethiopian economy in general, and the financial sector in particular, exhibit several deficiencies in how well it delivers the above services. As a result, the development of a stable, efficient and inclusive financial system, along with an effective policy and institutional environment for private sector growth are crucial to sustained economic growth for Ethiopia.<br /><br />Potential offerors interested in participating in this competition&nbsp;are strongly encouraged to review the SOW and provide comments, including the contract type. The deadline for submitting comments and suggestions is December 12, 2011.<br /><br />Please submit written comments and suggestions electronically to <a href="mailto:caddis@usaid.gov">caddis@usaid.gov</a>.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE AWARD AND IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR QUOTES.&nbsp; <br /><br />ESTIMATED DOLLAR AWARD AMOUNT: $500,000
<p>ESTIMATED CONTRACT AWARD DATE: December 5, 2011</p>

Interact day-to-day with technologists, management, project management, contract developers, government developers, and other architects.<br />d. Working with the USPTO technologists and management, define and document the current and future state architecture of the Patent systems and propose a migration strategy from the current state to the future state.</p>
<p>PROPOSED CONTRACTOR: <br />Tactical Strategy Group, Inc.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR NON-COMPETITION: <br />The Patent and Patent Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253).</p>
<p>The supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />The purpose of this Justification for Sole Source is to obtain approval for negotiating solely with William Ulrich, Tactical Strategy Group (TSG), Inc. for Subject Matter Expert services pertaining to the Patent End to End (PE2E) Portfolio, Program and Projects. As the developer of the process the USPTO has adopted to align its business and IT vision, Mr. Ulrich possesses a unique set of qualifications to continue to provide direction and guidance to the PE2E Business Architecture teams. This process, The Systems Redevelopment Methodology (TSRM), will be used for the analysis and recommendations of the PE2E current and future state value streams, capability mapping and business solutions.</p>
<p>As the developer of TSRM, Mr. Ulrich has the unique ability and expertise to provide the best use of this process to deconstruct business architectures and provide recommendations to deliver the cross-functional, cross disciplinary visibility required to enable complex business transformations. Additionally, Mr. Ulrich possesses the unique ability and expertise to provide the best use of this process to determine the viability of a given business/IT transformation strategy from a fully independent perspective.</p>
<p>The USPTO contracted with TSG and Mr. Ulrich in FY2010 and 2011 to guide the Trademark business in the use of TSRM to prepare and deliver an assessment of the proposed Trademark Next Generation (TM NG) Program. The resulting report, the Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report, was submitted on December 16, 2010. The USPTO has accepted and is currently implementing the recommendations provided in the report including the use of TSRM to continuously analyze and refine the Trademark Business Architecture.</p>
<p>Based on these results for the Trademark Business, the Patent Business senior management agrees that this same approach can add significant value to the Patent Business as well. Because of Mr. Ulrich's expertise and ownership in this area, he would require very little ramp up to apply TSRM to the Patent Business.</p>
<p>Although the Patent Business currently does not have the in-house expertise or capability, the decision was made to develop the internal capability and expertise to produce and maintain the Patent Business Architecture. Mr. Ulrich's expertise in the methodology already used by USPTO to do this makes him uniquely qualified to help stand up and guide this new Business Architecture team through the process of creating the Patent Business Architecture. With Mr. Ulrich's expertise and guidance in TSRM, the Patent Business Architecture team will make substantial progress in defining and mapping the Patent Business value streams and business capabilities of the current state and are identifying capability needs that will form the basis of the future state Business Architecture for USPTO.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise and experience with TSRM is required in order to complete the current state of the Business Architecture and develop the future state for the Business Architecture. This work is extremely important as it will be the foundation for the Patent End to End work. After the Business Architecture is complete, the Patent End to End Program will use the unique qualifications of Mr. Ulrich to help translate the Business Architecture into the Patent End to End Business/IT Architecture and solutions that meet the Patent business needs in a manner consistent with the other accepted recommendations made in the Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report.</p>
<p>Description of Market research conducted:<br />Market research was conducted through the Internet. Mr. Ulrich is the inventor and expert in The Systems Redevelopment Methodology (TSRM) adopted by the USPTO. This methodology was provided to the USPTO in FY2010 and 2011 and Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise in this methodology allows the USPTO to continue this work with the Patent Business. Mr. Ulrich's previous work with the USPTO gives him substantial background knowledge of both the patents and trademark businesses. He has a superlative set of qualifications as a business strategist relating to business value definition, software development methodologies and legacy system migration. Mr. Ulrich is widely published and a recognized industry leader of substantial reputation. Given how central Patents End to End is to the goals of this agency, it's difficult to justify going with someone who is less well-known and less respected, and the field of people who are as well-known and well-respected as Mr. Ulrich is very, very slim.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich is the only responsible source to meet the Agency's needs based on his unique expertise, experience and the Agency's adoption of the recommendations from Mr. Ulrich's report Trademark Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report. No other source has the expertise regarding the use of the recommended methodology to implement Mr. Ulrich's report findings and recommendations combined with Mr. Ulrich's qualifications to guide the Patents Business Architecture team in the development of the Patent End to End Business Architecture.</p>
<p>Past attempts by the USPTO to map business capabilities using other methodologies have failed to gain traction and provide value. By contrast, the USPTO has enjoyed immense success due to his efforts on the Trademarks Business Architecture. Mr. Ulrich's process has taken many years to develop, refine, and validate; thus, it is uniquely suited to create a business architecture that not only meets the needs of the Patents Office, but it provides a solution that aligns and integrates closely with the Trademarks Business architecture and allows the USPTO to leverage a common language for communicating business capabilities. We are not aware of any other similar process/methodology that meets our needs.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUNE 2004)<br />For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br /><br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. <br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. <br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. <br />The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

The quote should not simply rephrase or restate the Governments requirements, but rather shall provide substantiation as to how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.</p>

<p>Contractors intending to conduct business with the Federal Government must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award. The CCR is the primary Government repository, which retains information on Government contractors. You may register via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling (888) 227-2423 or (269) 961-5757.</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jan 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-</p>
<p>"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.</p>
<p>"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-</p>
<p>(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and</p>
<p>(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).</p>

<p>(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF <br />AB133F-12-RQ-0192</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED FOR SUPPLY <br />_____________</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />Construct a complete surface pair trawl as described in detail in the attached specification file (provided with the CD-435). This new trawl replaces older trawls of similar design extensively damaged during the near flood conditions of 2011. The trawls are specialty designs used to concentrate and guide migrating juvenile salmonids, included those listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, through an electronic detection antenna installed in place of a usual cod-end. Detection of passive-integrated-transponder (PIT) tagged juvenile salmon in the Columbia River estuary will allow survival of juvenile salmonids to be partitioned between river and ocean environments and facilitate a more complete understanding of survival and timing differences between transported and in-river-migrant groups. This is a multi-year study that began in 1995 and has continued annually since that time. Through the years a series of replacement trawl nets have been necessary to withstand the rigors of sampling nearly 1,000 h per year. The goal of this project is to partition survival of juvenile salmonids between river and ocean environments and provide survival estimates between transported and in-river out migrating groups. Additional information on travel time, diel migration patterns, and migration behavior in response to flow and water temperature are also be collected by species and compared to similar data collected in the upper estuary from through 2011. Sampling will begin in March and continue through June, with daily effort adjusted commensurate with the numbers of yearling migrants detected. Sampling will continue into the summer months, targeting subyearling migrants. We have one trawl, constructed in 2009, that remains in reasonably sound condition, but our two backup trawl constructed in 2006 and 2007 were well used in previous years and extensively damaged in 2011. A normal use\repair rotation among trawls is necessary to maintain a consistent sample effort required for making survival estimates but at this point we have no reliable backup trawl to our 2009 built trawl thus we are soliciting bids for a replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />Our surface pair-trawl is specialized and no substitution of design or materials can be done without prior approval. The components utilizing 11/16-inch mesh is of particular concern as prior experience with beach and purse-seine nets show that even slightly larger mesh openings can gill and trap fish (the last 100-ft of the trawl wings closest to the antenna, the floor, and the trawl body use 11/16-in webbing). Neither are smaller mesh openings in this area acceptable due to excessive drag. Similarly, the distal 100-foot wing section is constructed of 1.5-inch mesh and we can allow no larger mesh in that section for fear of gilling adult salmon or steelhead. The middle 100-foot wing section is constructed of 1-inch mesh and we would consider substitution of a more readily available intermediate sized mesh (between 1.5-in and 1-inch) to further reduce drag if 1-inch mesh is unavailable.</p>
<p>The general trawl components are described below. However, the detailed specification sheet for the various components is included as a separate attachment and must be followed to ensure correct design and construction.<br />Surface pair-trawl for sampling juvenile salmonids:</p>
<p>Wing-sections (three 100 ft sections of varying mesh sized per each side of trawl). Under tow we maintain about 300-ft between the ends of the wing which concentrate fish in a triangular shape along its length to a fixed frame antenna opening 8.5-ft wide by 10-ft tall about 400-ft downstream.<br />Distal wing (furthest from the antenna) is 1.5-inch stretch measure knotted mesh tapering from 10-ft to 15-ft. 5/8-in diameter cork line (initial 40-ft Spectra and 70' Tennix) with 25, 3.5 lb corks on 48-in centers); Lead lines &frac12;-in diameter Sprectra with 63 lbs lead as per drawing.<br />Middle Wing section is 1-in stretch measure webbing, using 5.8-in dia Tennix cork line (74, 3.5 lb cords on 16-in. centers) and lead line &frac12;-in. Spectra with 63 lbs lead as per drawing. This middle wing section tappers from a 15-ft depth where it joins the previous wing section to 20-ft. where it joins the rear wing section.</p>
<p>Proximal wing (nearest the antenna). This wing is composed of 11/16-in stretch measure knotted webbing (though we would consider knotless webbing if knotted unavailable). This section is square cut to a 20-ft depth and includes a floor attached ahead of the footrope that connects the two wing sections as per drawing. Small triangles of webbing reinforce the corners where this head rope connects the wings. There is approximately 30-ft of head rope and foot rope between the wings at the entrance to the trawl body.</p>
<p>Trawl body. This section is a approximately 100-ft long section of 11/16-in webbing behind the head and foot ropes. Its specific dimensions are listed in the drawing, but essentially is an asymmetric design where the top panel terminates 2-ft beneath the surface and the bottom panel rises (from 20-ft wing depth) to 12 ft beneath the surface (matching the 8.5-ft wide by 10-ft deep antenna suspended on a buoy 2-ft beneath the surface.). The trawl body has debris removal ports closed by industrial strength zippers as shown in the drawings.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation ; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N68836-12-T-0065 and is issued as a Request for Quotation.
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-26 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-19. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413and the business size standard is 1000
Fleet Contracting Center, Naval Air Station Jacksonville Fl intends to purchase the following line items.
 This procurement  is NOT set a side for small business

01.	 REPAIR OF F404 SERVO  VALVES P/N  A28965-001   20 EA
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT  1.0 Introduction  1.1  The Fleet Readiness Center, Southeast, (FRC) formerly known as the NAVAIR Depot Jacksonville, FL., requires repair and overhaul support for the actuator servo valve installed on the F404 Fan Guide Vane Actuator, Part Number A28965-001.   

The actuator provides an output force and motion to a variable fan stator system in response to an integral fan stator actuator servo valve. The actuator is a singleended uncushioned type, powered by engine fuel under pressure, and is capable of applying force in either the extend or retract direction.
 The component is equipped with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), which provides position feedback of the rod as a function of an electrical input signal.

Fluid entering the actuator is ported to the electro-hydraulic servo valve, where depending upon the electrical input signal, flow will be controlled to extend or retract the actuator. Under zero input signal, the actuator is biased to extend. Return fluid is ported through the servo valve and out through the actuator housing.


2.0 Background     2.1  The lifecycle of the servo valve is subject to high temperatures under which these valves operate. The elsatomeric seals are subject to degradation. Leakage from degraded seals located under the motor cap can lead to pressure build-up and subsequent deformation as Beyond Economical Repair (BER) without additional repair support.
 
FRC-SE does not have support equipment or test stand to overhaul these valves. 
 3.0 Scope 
3.1  The Government will provide to the contractor servo valves with accompanying work orders requiring maintenance, repair, and/or overhaul service. The contractor will return to the Government only repaired servo valves that are ready for issue.
USG requires vendor to return valves to RFI condition by inspecting servo valves received, disassembling units, repairing and replacing parts, and assembling and testing units.  All procedures shall be in accordance with specifications and documentation of section 4.0 of this SOW.  Any deviations from these documents should be coordinated through the USG F404 Fleet Support Team.
  

3.2  Critical Safety Item Requirements

source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the
intended application.  Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and
selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession
and cannot be economically obtained

To comply with DoD mandate to get better value for defense goods, a target 
unit price reduction of 10 percent or better is established for this  
requirement.
 This price reduction is additive to any other price benefits 
attributable to market conditions, economic trends and/or quantity variances. 
Please aggressively evaluate opportunities for reducing overhead costs, 
improving business practices and reducing wasteful, inefficient processes 
prior to submitting your offer for this requirement.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

Previous testing at the ERDC has identified rapid-setting flowable fill as a potential solution to backfill damaged pavements providing minimal interruption of operation.<br><br>Work<br>One hundred and twenty eight (128) cubic yards of rapid-setting flowable fill are required to backfill 18 simulated bomb craters at the ERDC Poor House testing facility. Materials will be evaluated using both the traditional wet-mixed method and the accelerated dry-placement method. The traditional method includes the use of fixed volume "drum type" or volumetric mixers. The dry-placement method involves dispensing the aggregate-cementitious blend directly into the prepared excavation and metering the required mix-water over the backfill surface. The mix-water is allowed to percolate through the dry material matrix, hydrating the cementitious materials, providing a hardened layer with the properties of in-place flowable fill. ERDC researchers will examine the current rapid repair methods in addition to developing optimized procedures that minimize labor intensity, manpower, equipment, and construction time requirements. <br><br>Specifications<br>1.	Capability to be placed using both the traditional wet-mixed and dry-placement methods.<br>2.	Ultimate 28-day compressive strength of 750 to 1,200 psi determined in accordance with ASTM International standard test method ASTM D 4832 when placed using the traditional method.<br>3.	Seventy percent (70%) or more of the ultimate 28-day compressive strength must be achieved when placed using the dry-placement method.<br>4.	Initial hardening must be completed in 30 minutes or less determined in accordance with ASTM D 6024.<br>5.	Flow consistency of 8 to 12 inches determined in accordance with ASTM D 6103 when placed using the traditional method.<br>6.	Minimal segregation (< 5%) of solid and liquid mixture proportions determined in accordance with ASTM C 1610 when placed using the traditional method.<br>7.	Minimal linear shrinkage (< 2%) of hardened specimens determined in accordance with ASTM C 426 when placed using the traditional method.<br><br>Requirements<br>1.	Results of standardized testing, material safety data sheet (MSDS), and optimal mix-water proportions for both the traditional and dry-placement methods must be provided to the technical point of contact (POC) within 30 days of awarding contract.<br>2.

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL
<p>1.1 SCOPE</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) National Strike Force (NSF) requires contractor support for instruction of the most current National Fire Academy (NFA) Chemistry for Emergency Response Course. The Contractor will provide a bid for one (1) year base and four (4) optional years.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), is the federal government's blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The NCP is the result of our country's efforts to develop a national response capability and promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans. The NCP includes a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges, in addition to releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>Within the NCP, the NSF Strike Teams (NSFST) are designated as Special Teams required to maintain the standing ability to support Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense predesignated Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) for any discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil into a navigable waterway of the U.S., or a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment of the U.S.</p>
<p>Understanding the basics of chemistry and how it applies to emergency response is fundamental with regards to providing support to FOSC's for both oil discharges and hazardous substance releases. As a part of the NSF qualification process, personnel must successfully demonstrate mastery of the skills and knowledge provided in the NFA Chemistry for Emergency Response Course.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>1.3.1 Instructor Qualifications. The Contractor instructors shall be certified under the National Fire Academy. Proof of current certification shall be submitted with all proposals and bids.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Cost for services. Costs in bid shall include travel and per diem for the instructors.<br /><br />1.3.3 FAR Subpart 19.7 Small Business Subcontracting Program applies</p>
<p>1.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not employ any person for work under this contract who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>1.5 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>The primary place of performance will be at the three NSFST's. The Government will provide all classroom facilities. There will be one convening per location annually. The locations of the three NSFST's are:</p>
<p>1. Atlantic Strike Team: Fort Dix, New Jersey<br />2. Gulf Strike Team: Mobile, Alabama<br />3. Pacific Strike Team: Novato, California</p>

<p>3.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED RESOURCES &amp; INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The Government will provide notice to the Contractor requesting a course convening not less than forty five (45) calendar days in advance. At least two weeks prior to each course convening, the COTR will provide the Contractor with the student roster for each class with the names of students registered for each course. The roster will consist of personnel of varying experience levels. The initial roster may change prior to the course date due to cancellations and substitutions based on operational requirements.</p>
<p>4.0 CONTRACTOR FURNISHED PROPERTY.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Solicitation to address current issues associated with acquiring critical spare parts for military systems and improve participation of small manufacturers in building components for the military, the DoD is seeking E-sourcing solutions that screen, organize and present Government spare part requirements to the industrial base thereby improving the ability to pair the right suppliers with the right parts at the right time. Web-based supplier "portals" such as FedBizOpps.gov provide varying capabilities for sourcing manufactured goods from the industrial base. However, there is no national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers. Numerous inchoate examples exist in the US as a result of sector-wide efforts (e.g. supplier exchanges), but technical, procedural, and cultural barriers exist which limit the full potential of such portals to open opportunities for more US manufacturing business. The DoD seeks to explore the potential of an advanced "electronic marketplace" to improve industrial base response to critical warfighter needs.</p>
<p>Potential portal-based solutions must serve as an interface between existing Government systems and the industrial base. They should organize industrial base participants based upon their manufacturing capabilities and provide matched opportunities to the most relevant pools of suppliers. It is the intent of DoD to select, mature and implement an electronic marketplace ("sourcing portal") that will enhance the industrial base's ability to access and bid on relevant business opportunities while addressing a diminishing DoD supply-base, high lead times for parts acquisitions and higher than needed lifecycle costs.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES<br />Define, design and deploy a capability which:<br />&bull; Develops and pilots tools and practices which cause a greater number of US companies to bid on DoD business;<br />&bull; Improves the capability of US manufacturers to participate and thrive in a digital enterprise; <br />&bull; Develops advanced capabilities for identifying manufacturers ("sourcing") and matching capability and capacity to needs; and<br />&bull; Becomes self-sustaining, with potential to scale-up beyond DoD markets and significantly expand national and global access to (and demand for) US manufacturing capacity</p>

<DESC><p>This is a synopsis is for the C-5 Anti-Skid System Upgrade effort. The antiskid system used on the C-5 aircraft requires an upgrade for improved maintainability and functionality, the Air Force needs to provide a replacement antiskid controller for this aircraft. The new system shall resolve antiskid maintenance and functionality issues in a cost effective and timely manner, and be compatible with the existing aircraft. The offeror shall develop, qualify, support airworthiness certification, and produce retrofit production quantities of a new C-5 antiskid control unit that incorporates the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification. The Government anticipates issuing a single award contract. The duration of this contract is anticipated November 2011 through September 2016. The Contract will be a Full and open competitively awarded and is fixed-price. <br />The solicitation will be posted to FBO with the same number at this notice.<br />Once formal Request for Proposal is issued, all responsible sources may submit a response which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency.<br />The Government reserves the right to cancel this notice at any time.<br />Foreign participation is permitted at the prime contractor level.<br />For previous postings regarding this requirement, please refer to the sources sought synopsis FA8251-10-C5-ASUF-C-5 and FA8251-11-C-ASSIRD previously posted in FBO. For this and all future postings, please refer to solicitation number FA8211-12-R-3000.</p>
<p>The Government&nbsp;requests Industry to review and provide feedback/questions.</p>
<p>Below are current questions and answers:<br /><br />1. Does the current C5 Anti skid system comprise a side slip<br />protection control, intended to prevent the aircraft to slide away from<br />the runway? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The current system does not have slide slip protection control. This system releases brake pressure long before allowing the forward tire slip to reach a level where side forces will cause side tire slip. This is a very conservative method of reducing forward tire slip, but will also greatly<br />reduce the efficiency of the antiskid system (prematurely releasing brake<br />pressure).</p>
<p><br />2. If the current system doesn't have the side slip control, is it a<br />requirement for the proposed system? If it is not a firm requirement, is<br />it still a desirable added feature? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: Side slip protection control is an understood feature for modern antiskid systems, and not a stand-alone requirement. Therefore, it will be evaluated as we evaluate the general knowledge and capability of the supplier to design an antiskid control unit. The antiskid algorithm is required to be more efficient by tightly controlling the brake pressure very close to the tire slip threshold. By not allowing the tire to slip in the forward direction, the tire is able to withstand side forces and not slip in side directions.</p>
<p><br />3. Could the proposed system be provided with the actual aircraft<br />ground speed data? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The proposed system is required to be plug-and-play with the existing wiring, only adding wiring for pressure transducers as per the released performance specification (PS). Ground speed is provided to the current<br />system via the 24 wheel speed sensors, also described in the PS.</p>
<p><br />4. Concerning the requirement for equal distribution of the<br />dissipated energy, we would like to know if equal energy distribution<br />should be kept between the brakes included in each landing gear, or, the<br />requirement also covers equal energy dissipation between the brakes of<br />each pair- left and right landing gears or between the brakes of all 4<br />landing gears? <strong>ANSWER:</strong> The purpose of equal distribution of brake energy is to balance energy between all brakes of the entire aircraft, thus mitigating the issue of the current system with overheating brakes.</p>
<p>5. One of the postings, sounded like it would go to General Atomics as essentially a sole source. The new posting ( FA8211-12-R-3000) sounded like it will be full and open competition. Can you let me know what the story is? <strong>ANSWER</strong>: Any past reference to General Atomics, should reflect that they will be the integrator of this project. The actual C-5 Antiskid Control Unit (ACU) Replacement Program will be full and open competition. Please continue to monitor FA8211-12-R-3000 for any further updates and postings.</p>
<p>6. Foreign Interest in FA8211-12-R-3000, request information be directly sent to requestors. <strong>ANSWER:</strong> The Government will Post all items relevant to any future RFP or request on the FBO website. The Government will not be able to make any special accommodations to Foreign offerors. All potential offerors will have the same access to all information via FA8211-12-R-3000 postings.</p>
<p>7. Contractor suggests, when the next "stage" solicitation is released, relative to previous RFI's FA8251-10-C5-ASUF and FA8251-11-C5-ASSIRD, that FAR 52.227-1 ALT.1 be engaged. <strong>ANSWER</strong>: The Government will review all necessary clauses and contract suggestions when creating the model contract.</p>

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH REPLACES 1.1.1 ON THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT OF WORK.<br /><br />1.1.1 Air National Guard (ANG) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Companion Aircraft Program (ARCAP). ARCAP was created to ensure the ANG RPA rated force (11Uxx AFSC) retains manned aircraft proficiency to maximize aircrew airmanship and situational awareness while operating RPA due to limited local training opportunities. Also, it maintains force flexibility for potential transition to additional/other unit aircraft, and augments unit capabilities for state or federal emergent response. The 163rd Reconnaissance Wing's (hereinafter<br />"163rd") intent is to get its Rated Pilots checked out in the Companion Aircraft, and maintain currencies IAW AFI 11-2T-41/50/52/53.<br /><br />

<DESC>This is a follow-up announcement to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00019-12-R-0001. The Source Sought announcement includes details of the aircraft and general tasking required.&nbsp; The resulting decision based on the review of sources sought responses is that <strong>this effort will be&nbsp;solicited using full and open competitive&nbsp;procedures under NAICS 488190.<br /></strong>
<p><strong>DRAFT PWS:<br /></strong>The Government intends to post a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and associated DRAFT documents for industry's review and feedback on or about 01 December 2011.</p>
<p>The Government is receptive to ideas to reduce constraining requirements, reduce risks, reduce costs, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award. The Government intends to implement a Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) to measure Contractor performance. The measures align with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Performance, and Sustainment. A performance incentive is likely to be associated with performance that exceeds contractual minimum requirements, measured by the PMF. Once the PMF is available in DRAFT form, the Government will solicit comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.<br /><br />The Government invites written industry feedback as noted above in the form of recommendations and/or questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 04 January 2012; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals. Contractors are directed NOT to present or provide proprietary information. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Responses and comments will not be published, nor will they be released. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting. <strong>Please submit via e-mail to Jessica McGee at </strong><a href="mailto:jessica.mcgee@navy.mil"><strong>jessica.mcgee@navy.mil</strong></a><strong> on or by 12:00 p.m. EST on 14 January 2012.</strong></p>

The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the Industry Day.</p>
<p><strong>GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY ONE-ON-ONE's:<br /></strong>In addition to the requested written feedback, following the Industry Day conference, the Government invites interested companies to privately present meaningful feedback in-person. Please be mindful that the one-on-one sessions are not intended for Q&amp;A dialogue between the Government and Industry. They are offered for Industry to share recommendations and/or concerns regarding the upcoming competition as a preface to the written feedback due by 04 January 2011. The Government does not intend to discuss any portion of the acquisition strategy during the one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p><strong>One-on-One sessions will be scheduled between 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 14 December 2011, and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 15 December 2011.</strong> The amount of time alloted to each company will be approximately one hour, but ultimately dependant on the number of companies scheduled.

<CONTACT>Graham Irby 202-781-0079 Graham Irby, graham.irby@navy.mil
<DESC>All comments that were provided against the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) were reviewed and updates to the solicitation were made as deemed appropriate.  The following are answers to specific questions that may increase offerors understanding of the intent of the solicitation. 

1. The number of FTS units (CLIN 0024) of 40, POM assets (CLIN 0014) of 14, and Telemetry assets (SOW 3.5) of 0 do not seem to correlate to each other or to the intent of the SOW.  Can the Navy provide guidance as to the usage profile of the 40 FTS units and the 14 POM units?

Response: The quantities of the FTS, POM, and Telemetry assets have been updated.  It is the intent of the Navy to use the assets in support of integration testing with the P-8A.

2.
 The Statement of Work (SOW) has a requirement that hardware provided under this effort shall be capable of fitment, load, and employment from the P-8A aircraft with no hardware changes to the aircraft or the MK 54.  Does this requirement pertain only to the Warshot, Exercise, and Ballistic Air Test Vehicle configurations, or does it also preclude changes to the Fixed Wing Launch hardware?

Response: This requirement does not preclude changes to the current fixed wing air launch accessories.

3. Within the ALA Performance Specification, the placement accuracy requirement lists four conditions.  Item 3.3.1.3.1.(c) states At max AUR Glide Range in a GPS aided environment.   Is the max AUR Glide Range identified in item (c) the same as the 35 nmi KSA Objective range defined in paragraph 3.3.1.2.4?

Response: The max AUR glide range in item (c) is a reference to the max AUR glide range of a given HAAWC concept.
   The placement accuracy is independent of range, and the intent of the item (c) is to define the requirement at whatever maximum range a given HAAWC concept can achieve, whether this range is 25 nmi, 45 nmi, or some other range beyond the KSA threshold range.

4. Please clarify the intended verification requirements for those items that reference the P-8A.

Response: Verification of those items that reference the P-8A will be accomplished during follow on efforts.  However, it is the governments desire to complete as much of the verifications as possible during this effort.

5. In order to reduce schedule risk and cost, is it acceptable to the Government to conduct the SFR and SSR as independent reviews on consecutive days?

Response: The intent of discussion within the Statement of Work regarding the timeline of the System Engineering Technical Reviews was to define the required timeline to conduct the SRR, CDR, and PRR.
  All other reviews can be accomplished at any time within the program, including being held on consecutive days. 

6. Within the HAAWC ALA Performance Specification, what is the range applicable to the 15K ft MSL time-to-water-entry (TTWE) requirement?

Response:  There is no applicable range for the referenced TTWE requirement.  The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the HAAWC ALA can deliver the MK 54 lightweight torpedo within this timeline independent of any stand-off range requirement.

7. The specification contains requirements for AUR mass properties allowable variation.  Some of the mass property characteristics listed for the AUR are not known for the MK 54 torpedo along with the associated tolerances.
  In order for the Contractor to determine AUR mass property variation, it is requested that the current MK 54 information be provided.

Response:  The Navy is currently in the process of determining the MK 54 lightweight torpedo mass property characteristics.  This information will be provided as soon as testing is complete.

8. It is assumed that the MK 54 environmental capabilities as compared to the Appendix A requirements will be treated as-is without MK 54 hardware modifications or any attempt to re-assess the torpedos capabilities in the EMD requirements verification process.  Is this the Governments intention?

Response: The MK 54 lightweight torpedo will not be modified as part of this development.
  It is not the Navys intention to re-assess any of the torpedo capabilities, whether it be environmental, operational, or other.  There may be cases where the environmental requirements for the HAAWC ALA exceed the capability of the MK 54 lightweight torpedo; this is done to ensure that the HAAWC ALA can be safely jettisoned in those environmental concerns.  There is no expectation for the MK 54 lightweight torpedo to operate in this case.

9. It is requested that the Government provide information regarding test ranges it desires the Contractor to use during EMD.

Response: The Navy does not intend to provide the Contractor with a list of preferred ranges for use during HAAWC testing.  The Contractor is provided with the lee-way to select test ranges that are most advantageous to the Contractors proposed test approach.

10.
 CLIN 0018 quantity is stated as one (same as Section F) but the comment indicates "four non-metric and one metric models''.  Does that indicate the Government is actually seeking a total of five "small-scale (6.2%) models" where four are non-metric and one is metric'?

Response:  The requirement is for the Contractor to supply one lot consisting of one metric and four non-metric models.  The RFP and SOW have been modified to clarify the requirement.

11. Will the small scale metric model be required to be configured with stowed wing/fins? Will there be a requirement for the metric model to include a deployed wing/fins configuration?

Response:  If wings or fins will be deployed or active during the separation event, the metric small scale model shall be able to be configured to represent each state of the wings and fins achievable during separation.

<DESC>Amendment #1 extends the due date for proposals through 4:30 P.M. EST and provides answers to the below questions.  All other terms/conditions of the original RFQ remain unchanged.
-Do the parts need to be "drop-shipped" to 75 locations?A: No, the single FOB destination is: EPA-Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds  1301 Constitution Ave., NW  Washington, DC 20004 (Attn: Amina Pollard)-Will an EPA FedEx or UPS account be used?A: The cost of shipping should be built in either to the overall fixed-price amount or included as a seperate line item in the proposal.  -When does the Assessment start?A: March 2012 with field crew sampling starting in May 2012-In Item 1, what does 20 cm-30 cm cowling mean?A: A cowl, or reducing collar, is a sleeve that narrows the opening of plankton nets.  Cowls are often used in studies that quantify zooplankton from net tows.  These measurements give the dimensions of the collar, i.e., a 20 cm opening at the top of the collar and the 30 cm opening of the collar attaches to the net, which would have a 30 cm opening as well.  -In items 1 and 2, a Wisconsin-style net typically has two rings, a large one in the middle and a smaller one on top.  Are there simple sketches of the nets in question?A: The 3-point bridle attaches the net to the towing rope.  No sketches are available.  -Item 1 discusses simple plankton net with 50 micron mesh.  Also contained in item 1 is "Plankton net: heavy duty nylon net of 150 micron mesh...".  This is similar verbiage to item 2.  Is it a seperate line item?  Between items 1 and 2, are 2 nets or 3 nets required?A: Two nets are required-75 50-micron mesh nets and 75 150-micron mesh nets.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract will allow the performance of a collaborative research study with the United States Anny Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research) scientists to examine the resiliency to mTBI in the distressed rat. This is a collaborative effort to conduct a 2 phase study and acquire the skills to perform head-injuries (blast and non-blast) using sedated rats exposed to IED-like blast profiles. Phase I will include training, setup, and preparing 12 control rats and 12 rats for 24 hour post mTBI. Phase II will examine dietary zinc in various doses following blast injury using both behavioral and biochemical studies to assess repair mechanisms.

2.	Nature/Description of Action Being Processed:

This activity proposes to solicit with Arizona State University, using other than full and open competition procedures to provide the Phoenix Health Care System (PVAHCS), Southeast Community Based Outpatient Clinic (SE CBOC) with a lease extension until the new  SE CBOC is completed by Real Property Service(anticipated award November 2011). 
The lease extension will be a modification to the existing lease which is set to expire on December 31, 2011. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs:

The Phoenix VA Health Care System currently occupies 43,982 net square feet of medical space for the SE CBOC. On April 16, 2010, the Phoenix VA Health Care System Director requested delegation authority from Real Property Service to extend Lease V101-084-019-97(SE CBOC).The Phoenix VA Health Care System Director requested the lease extension be procured through VISN 18 CCA delegated authority. VISN 18 Consolidated Contracting Activity (CCA) received approval from Real Property Service providing delegation approval to implement the lease extension. The current requirement is for a one year term from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 with a one year renewal period from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 or until September 30, 2013. The Department of Veterans Affairs has a continued need for the leased medical space until the new SE CBOC construction is completed.

Estimated Annual Rental Cost: 	$539,219.32	 


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

In accordance with GSAM 570.405 Lease Extensions the following statutory authority is cited as justification for a lease extension to Arizona State University.

The statutory authority permitting Lease Extensions is GSAM 570.405 
	(a) This subsection applies to extension of the term of a lease to provide for continued 		occupancy on a short term basis. 

	(b) If the value of a lease extension will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, 	the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. 


(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy

Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1(c); authorizes contracting without providing for full and open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. This authority may apply to lease extensions in situations such as the following: (2) The Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its control in acquiring replacement space. 
                                                         
5.	Demonstration that the  Contractors Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Required the Use of the Authority Cited Above(applicability of authority):

The SE CBOC is located at 6950 East Williams Field Road, Mesa Arizona 85012 on the Arizona State University campus. The current lease was initiated January 1, 1997 and expires on December 31, 2011. On October 28, 2008, the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs approved the relocation and replacement of the SE CBOC located in Mesa, Arizona. The PVAHCS was approved for 60,000 square feet of space to replace the existing lease. The approval will also compensate for the spatial needs due to the increase in patient workload. The PVAHCS submitted a request to Real Property Service on November 5, 2008 to conduct the replacement of the lease for the SE CBOC. Notification was received on January 27, 2009, from Real Property that they were ready to begin the acquisition process for the new Mesa CBOC. 

Once the acquisition was initiated by Real Property Service, the PVAHCS had to resubmit a new authorization package to include the parking analysis and space plan. The Federal Business Opportunities notification was posted from April 13, 2009 through March 29, 2010 for anticipation of the new procurement. The market survey was conducted on June 22 & 23, 2010. It was determined on the market survey that PVAHCS leadership wanted to decrease the area of consideration. PVAHCS requested that the delineated area be decreased since the area was encroaching into the service area for the PVAHCS hospital. Therefore, the requirement had to be re-advertised and a new market survey conducted on October 28, 2010. Considering a new delineated area did cause additional steps in the procurement process that extended the original timeline. Therefore, due to the re-advertising for the new delineated area and the approval for the lease acquisition process. It has caused an unanticipated increase to the timeline in order to complete the project by December 31, 2011.

A solicitation for new space is expected to be issued by Real Property Service on May 25, 2011, with an anticipated award, no later than November 1, 2011. It is anticipated that occupancy will occur no later than September 30, 2013. The proposed lease extension will provide sufficient time for award of the new lease as well as completion of the build out. Because of the amount of time needed to complete this requirement, the Contracting Officer is requesting approval to extend the existing lease pursuant to the authority of GSAR 570.405 (c)(2).  The total negotiated price for the extension is $12.26 per ANSI/BOMA square foot, for a total monthly cost of $44,934.94.  The total cost of the two year extension will be $1,078,438.60.  

The current negotiated lease rate for the base and current extension period is $12.26 per ANSI/BOMA square foot for a fully serviced lease, totaling $539,219.32 for each extension period. This rate has already been determined to be fair and reasonable to the Government. It is anticipated that the lessor will agree to the extension without a change in the rental rate. If an increase in the rental rates is requested, further negotiations will take place to ensure that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable.  This will bring the total value of the lease, including all options and extensions to $9,166,728.40. The lease would be in existence for a total of seventeen years, including all options and extensions.

There are two significant factors that controlled the establishment of the pre-negotiation objectives and the negotiated agreement. First, the Government requires the lease extension in order to provide sufficient time to complete a replacement lease as well as complete any build out requirement to meet the Governments requirements.  Secondly, in order to justify any request for increase in the rental rate the Government must be able to show that proposed rate is fair and reasonable. If a rental rate increase is requested, an appraisal of the property will be completed by a MAI certified appraiser at the Governments request.

It would not be feasible to conduct a temporary lease to supplement the lease extension due to the size of the requirement and the time required to relocate to temporary space. A temporary relocation of similar size would be a waste of funds since it has been identified additional space is needed. The move costs would be the same to move to temporary space as it would be to move to the new larger space once the procurement is completed. Furthermore, the PVAHCS did their due diligence to initiate the request for replacement of the lease to provide sufficient lead time. It would be in the Governments best interest to remain at the current location until Real Property Service has awarded the new procurement.

      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:	Arizona State University
								6027 S. Sagewood
								Mesa, Arizona 85212

							 
6.	Description of the Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:

There are sources capable of providing approximately 44,000 square feet of medical office space in the Mesa, Arizona region which was determined through searches on LoopNet (www.loopnet.com). It would not be feasible to move to these locations on a temporary basis since it has been identified by the PVAHCS that they require 60,000 square feet. 

Real Property Service posted a sources sought notice on the Federal Business Opportunities website on January 27, 2010 (VA-101-10-RP-0051). The sources sought notice was requesting interested offerors to submit properties satisfying approximately 60,000 square feet of medical space. An additional notification was posted in the Arizona Republic Newspaper for properties to be submitted for market survey by no later than March 1, 2010. 


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on current market rental rates. A search for commercial properties of similar size and use was conducted on LoopNet (www.loopnet.com). LoopNet identified seven possible properties that are available in the Mesa area for possible relocation. The properties are ranging from $12.00 per square foot - $24.95 per square foot. The prices offered were un-serviced rental rates. 

The Lessor is offering the existing rental rate during the extension period of $12.26 per square foot. It is anticipated that the Lessor will agree to the extension without a cost increase to the rental rate. 


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research was Not Conducted:

A market survey was conducted on June 22, 2010 and October 28, 2010 for the relocation of the SE CBOC. The properties offered during the market survey were received in part from the sources sought notices posted on Federal Business Opportunities website. A total of 26 properties were located on June 22 & 23, 2010 for market survey. Of the 26 sites a total of three sites were rejected by the market survey team. On October 28, 2010 a total of 26 properties were identified for market survey. Of the 26 sites a total of thirteen sites were new submissions and the rest being the same properties from the market survey conducted previously. After the market surveys were conducted the market survey team accepted a total of six sites that would still be considered.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

Due to the importance of outpatient services provided to veterans in the Mesa, Arizona region.  It is necessary and urgent that other than full and open competition procurement procedures is appropriate to obtain the lease extension until the new lease is awarded. The new lease award will be conducted using full and open competition procedures. 




 
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an interest in the Acquisition:

Arizona State University
6027 S. Sagewood
Mesa, Arizona 85212


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies and services required:

In the future it may be advantageous to initiate a request to Real Property Service for replacement of an existing lease of this size within six to seven years prior to the ending of the lease. This would allow for additional time if unexpected barriers occur that would cause the procurement to be delayed.

Currently, Real Property Service is anticipated to issue a Solicitation for Offer on May 25, 2011 for a new requirement for a minimum of 60,000 sq feet of medical space. The new requirement will address the replacement of Lease V101-084-019-97 and additional space that is required.
