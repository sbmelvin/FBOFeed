<DESC>Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice contemplates award of up to two (2) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Federal Judicial District for the District of Connecticut.  Pursuant to the Federal Debt Recovery Act, this procurement is strictly limited to law firms or solo practitioners of law who are licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and who are regularly engaged in the private practice of law in that district.  Regularly engaged in this context is construed to mean that at least 20% of the debt collection cases handled by the firm/practitioner arise in the district.

Contract payments will be based on contingency fees (for unsecured debt collection) and/or firm-fixed prices (for secured debt collection).  The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be one (1) base year and up to six (6) option years.  The anticipated release date for the solicitation, which will be available only on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov), is June 28, 2007.  Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be available.

<SOLNBR>DOL079RQ20388

<CONTACT>Jennifer Snook, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-693-4585, Fax 202-693-7290, Email snook.jennifer@dol.gov
<DESC>The Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Employment Standards Administration intends to issue a Federal Supply Schedule Delivery Order with sole source IBM products to acquire additional middle-tier software and development tool licenses which are required to meet the needs of ESA's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs' Unified Case Management System (UECMS).  DOL requires specific IBM licenses to complete this project.  

The requirement is for the following items:
D572ZLL - IBM Websphere Process Server Value Unit License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D53V1LL - IBM Websphere Business Modeler Advanced User License + SW maintenance 12 months 

D5571LL - IBM WebSphere Integration Developer Authorized User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D54N4LL - IBM Rational Application Developer for WebShpere Software Authorized User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D532ELL - IBM Rational Team Unifying Platform Floating User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D54LILL - IBM Rational Software Architect Authorized User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D530BLL - IBM Rational Functional Tester Floating User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D54LTLL - IBM Rational Performance Tester Floating User License + SW Maintenance 12 months

D530ILL - IBM Rational Performance Test Pack Virtual Testers 500 Floating user License + SW Maintenance 12 months


ESA is currently operating with compatible IBM software products/licensing and to change vendors would be cost prohibitive.  Additionally, there would be cost prohibitive expenses to re-license each desktop and server across the DOL enterprise to another vendor's software.  Therefore, the cost to change to another vendor would greatly outweigh the cost to remain with IBM licenses.  Due to the cost prohibitive nature of changing vendors, only IBM supplies/services will satisfy the Department's requirements.  Also, IBM products are proprietary software; and, as such IBM is the developer and holds the rights and the patents.  IBM provides the technical expertise required to support this software including all of the software updates.

The period of performance is for twelve (12) months.  The estimated dollar value of this procurement is not to exceed $1 million.  

Quotes will be requested from IBM resale vendors on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule in accordance with FAR 8.405, Ordering Procedures for Federal Supply Schedules.  DOL intends to issue a firm-fixed-price delivery order based on proposed GSA FSS discounts proposed by vendors.  

This award will be made on or about June 20, 2007.     The proposed acquisition is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only authorized GSA Federal Supply Schedule holders that offer IBM Software Leasing in accordance with FAR 8.4, 8.405-6(2).     For further information, please contact Ms. Jennifer Snook, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room S1519B, Washington, D.C. 20210, snook.jennifer@dol.gov, (202) 693-4585.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority, 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The government intents to award a sole source (See approved sole source justification below) fixed price contract to Hershey Business Systems Inc., 14111 Freeway Dr Ste 100, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670.  If any interested parties can fulfill this requirement, please provide statement of interest to this office NLT 12:00 noon CDST on 15 Jun 2007.  Electronic submissions are acceptable.  Direct any correspondence to the 42d Contracting Squadron, Acquisition Flight B, 50 LeMay Plaza South (Building 804), Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6334, ATTN:  Kay Bent, faxed to (334)953-2198 or 3543, or emailed to kay.bent@maxwell.af.mil.  ATTACHMENT:  SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request #F2XHC77128A100 Description of the supplies and services being acquired.  The purposes of this acquisition is for CCAF to continue to license and use the Singularity transcript processing system and obtain technical support for the system.  Justification for Sole Source:  CCAF, under delivery orders F01600-02-P-0346 and F01600-02-P-0438 has been using Hershey Business Systems Inc. (HBSI) as the prime contractor to develop the web-enabled enterprise-wide transcript processing and access management system known as Singularity.  HBSI is the sole provider of this software and is the only known source that can fill the unique licensing and maintenance requirements of this system in a cost effective, timely manner.  There are no other distributors of this service.  The software is developed by HBSI and they the have proprietary data rights to the software.  CCAF will continue to closely monitor ongoing advancements and design innovations in the commercial computer software industry and will actively seek to solicit input from additional contractors in the future to assure full and open competition is available on all future acquisitions of this type.  This software must be licensed annually and maintained through software updates, patches, and additional capabilities.  This effort requires the contractor to have considerable knowledge of CCAF?s Student Information System (STARS), remote Education Services Offices access processes, and the integration and delivery of EDI 130 Transaction Files from the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) EDI server located on the University of Texas at Austin campus.  Over the past year, HBSI acquired a thorough understanding of CCAF?s business processes, developed system specifications for the Web-Enabled Enterprise Wide Transcript Access Management System, designed and implemented the integration layer that is used to enhance the tracking of scanned and electronic received transcript information into the CCAF?s student information system, the Student Transcript, Administration and Record System, (STARS).  HBSI has also worked with CCAF technical personnel to deliver out-bound sorting of transcript data from STARS, to deliver electronic transcripts, conforming to the 130 transaction set to the AACRAO EDI server.  In addition to the out-bound electronic transcript process, HBSI developed the Automated Transcript Process Module to track out-bound EDI transactions and in-bound EDI transactions.  HBSI has developed this expertise over the last eight years by working with major higher education institutions similar to CCAF, such as University of Alabama, Auburn University, California State University, etc.  Throughout this period, HBSI has developed a Web -based framework that is J2EE compliant / XML based with a variety of products and systems that enhance student success, credit transfer and records retention.  Justification that source is the only known source: It has been determined from the first solicitation with HBSI being awarded the initial contract to deliver and perform to the Statement of Work (SOW), that no other contractor who specializes in similar projects could accomplish the roll out deployment and/or support the application.  In addition, the current developed software codes and comprehensive understanding of the CCAF internal business processes along with the expertise of the external EDI transaction data for incoming transcripts to CCAF support the fact that no other contractor could adequately support the current application and future enhancements.  Actions taken to preclude future sole source applications:  No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions (proprietary ownership of Singularity Imaging System and software).  //SIGNED// DANIEL R. HAYES, GS-15, DAF Date:  5 Jun 07 Dean Community College of the Air Force Approved:  //SIGNED// CHARLIE H. FOSTER, JR., Contracting Officer, Date:  5 Jun 07.

<DESC>Project Number 040006: Install Steam Lines Area B, MH S-227 to S-173A (Base) Project Number 040006: Rock Excavation (Option I) Project Number 960082-2: Replace Steam Lines Facility 20027 to S-227  (Option II) Project Number 061989: Replace Steam Lines Facility 20770 to S-202 (Option  III) Project Number 061989: Rock Excavation (Option IV) Solicitation Number FA8601-07-R-0042. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and  performing all labor required to install steam lines in Area B, MH S-227  to S-173A, to included excavation of approximately 1500 cubic yards of  hard material (Project 040006); replace steam lines from facility 20027 to  S-227 (Proejct 960082-2); and replace steam lines from Facility 20770 to  S-202, to include excavation of approximately 140 cubic yards of hard  material (Project 061989).  The scope will also include associated  architectural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications.  The  estimated price range is between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $13M.  This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in  accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program  Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in  the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations  issued after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at  http://www.ccr.gov, or telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation  issued after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004,  "Required Central Contractor Registration. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: A mechanical contractor with experience in  installing Steam/HTHW piping, valves, expansion joints is required.

Projects 040006 and 061989 must be accomplished during the  non-heating season and Project 9600822 must be accomplished during the  heating season.  This is a relatively short work performance window for a  contract with multiple critical tasks that must be completed in order for  the heating system to be fully operational in time for the heating season.  It is vital that the steam/heat to the affected facilities be available at  the start of the winter season.  Over half of the facilities in Area B  will be impacted, to include AFIT, Material Labs, Bio-Medical Center,  Computer Center, and the Avionics laboratories.  A highly experienced  mechanical contractor with extensive experience in steam piping is  required because no time extensions can be given to repair this critical  utility system. NOTES: (1) The solicitation will be available on the website on or about 3 July  07, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  The specifications and drawings will  be posted along with the synopsis. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you  may download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation.

4.	PURPOSE OF SYNOPSIS:  The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the vendor community of DISA?s proposed contract actions.  DISA intends to award sole-source to Anvicom Command Federal for continued IT operational support to the DISA Network (DISANet).  Enclosed is the approved justification and approval for use of other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 C (1).

5.   SYNOPSIS CLOSING DATE/TIME:  07 May 2007
 
6.	BACKGROUND: The DISANet represents the baseline data and telecommunications infrastructure installed and operational at the Headquarters, DISA, and its national capital region (NCR) and field offices.  The purpose of this information system is to support the Director and his supporting directorates in their efforts to provide timely and effective information and communications services to the war fighter.  The services provided by DISANet include electronic mail, office productivity applications, and Internet and intranet access, Voice over IP, information services, collaborative services, and formal message service.  DISANet also provides network access to mission oriented databases and applications maintained on non-DISANet networks.  Support will become effective ONLY upon issuance of a written task/delivery order.  The task/delivery order will describe in detail the current configuration of the information system to be supported and the specific services to be provided by the Contractor.  Several other networks are expected to be merged into the DISANet.  When these networks become the responsibility of the DISA Information Systems Center, the Contractor may be required to provide support for these networks, as tasked by written task/delivery orders.

6.1. The DISANet consists of over 35 locations worldwide.  Within the National Capitol Region (NCR) the use of Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) services provide connectivity between the smaller NCR locations and the two primary DISANet locations and datacenters.  The two primary DISANet locations as well as all DISANet field offices are connected via Wide Area Network (WAN) services being provided by the DISN (Global Information Grid (GIG), NIPRNet and SIPRNet).  These DISANet MAN and WAN connections are established on our DISANet Perimeter (Cisco) Routers.
6.2  Every network exists to serve its users.  Currently, there are 8902 unclassified users on the DISANet, with this number expected to ultimately grow to 10,000.  The classified DISANet has 3574 users at 12 locations world-wide, with this number expected to grow proportionally.
7.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The purpose of this contract is to provide support for that portion of the DISA Information System (DISA-IS) Infrastructure over which the DISA Information Systems Center (DISC) has operational responsibility, hereafter referred to as DISANet.  The DISA-IS consists of all computer systems, both networked and stand-alone, which support the information needs of DISA.  In addition, the Contractor may be required to provide similar support to other Information Systems (IS) and/or networks (OSD, Joint Staff, etc.) that are assigned to the DISA Information Systems Center for support and maintenance.
7.1 The Contractor shall provide necessary personnel, supervision, and management to perform integration, implementation, network monitoring and control, call center, administration, operation configuration management and security management for the DISANet and other information systems as tasked by specific task orders.  Services the Contractor will perform may include analysis, integration, implementation, operation and administration of information system components; software support of network devices, servers and client workstations; asset management; requirements management and solution; performance evaluation; product assessment and recommendations; documentation; Help Desk call center, help desk support; installation support and testing; training; configuration management; resource management; and implementation and maintenance of applicable security programs and procedures.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for a Database Modeling System (DBMS) with optional Airport Creation Toll (ATC) Software, maintenance, technical support and training for an estimated value of $168,482.00. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Rockwell Collins because they manufacture the EPX 5000 Image Generator System (IGS - The EPX 5000 generates and delivers to the simulation cab the images developed on the DBMS).  Rockwell Collins is the developer of the ACT Software.  Furthermore, Rockwell Collins is the only provider of DBMS maintenance, technical support and training.  Rockwell Collins develops and provides the proprietary interface between the DBMS and the IGS.  The DBMS employs identical runtime software to that which is on the larger IGS (visual host), which can only be acquired from Rockwell Collins.	This runtime software is used to actually fly around within the visual database and is essential to ensuring that the developed visuals are correct before simulation operations for the customer. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 19, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>K -- NATO NC3A Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding for Enhanced Capacity of the DLOS-Based Supporting Communication Network for KFOR Operations in Kosovo
<SOLNBR>RFQ-CO-12348-OPL
<RESPDATE>061107

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) in relation to the provision of various enhancements of the VHF-UHF Communication Network (VCN) in support of KFOR operations in Kosovo. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA Plus procedure. In response to this Notification of Intent (NOI), the U.S. Department of Commerce will be nominating to the bidders list qualified U.S. firms in addition to those already identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 2.5 million Euros ($3.4 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-12348-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

KFOR uses a DLOS-based communication network to support its operations in Kosovo. This project aims at upgrading the network to meet the following operational requirements:

- DLOS-connection of 2 task forces to the network.

- Support additional VHF coverage of KFOR Area of Operations in Kosovo. This project does not include the VHF equipment.

The communication network supporting KFOR operations in Kosovo is based on a star configuration of Line of Sight microwave links that support a VCN. Although mainly served by the current topology, the planned DLOS network includes the following additional requirements:

- A monitoring center capable of monitoring both old and new equipment.

- 4 additional DLOS sites: Pec, Lipjan, Cicavica and Zatric.

- Deliver a more robust link between Mount Goles and KFOR Main as a key link to support the overall KFOR DLOS-based communication network.

- Update the DLOS-based network architecture to balance the Mount Goles-KFOR Main key connection and provide redundancy so as to increase overall network robustness.

- Enhancement of several DLOS links within the network to a level that will support the new requirements stemming from the addition of 2 base stations associated with the VCN in Cicavica and Zatric. In this field, the links that constitute the network core loop between the KFOR Main primary radio switch and the Bondsteel secondary switch will need an upgrade so as to match the new bandwidth requirements.  

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for its facility and for all personnel assigned to the contract.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be nominated to the bidders list with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Government nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility: 11 June 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: June 2007

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: September 2007

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Blake Industries, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, for the acquisition of a Goniometer, X-Y Table, and Circle Segment to be used by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the equipment to be completely compatible and interchangeable with the existing instrumentation currently at the NCNR.  This requirement is for the goniometer head and circle segment that control the rotational position of the beam filters about the x and y axis, as defined by the beam line (z axis) and filter home position; and the sample table circle goniometer that controls the rotational position of the analyzer, sample, cryostat, magnet and beam opening about the y axis, as defined by the sample position and beam line(z axis); and the X-Y goniometer head that controls the rotational position of the sample along its x and z axis(beam line), as defined by the sample center and beam line, for a new Thermal Triple Axis Spectrometer (TTAS). The new TTAS will utilize all of the same component designs directly surrounding the goniometers, X-Y table, and circle segment, thus requiring the same interfaces. Therefore the goniometers, X-Y table, and circle segment for the new TTAS must be exactly identical to those on the present TTAS.  Blake Industries is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required equipment.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by June 20, 2007 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

For determination of size standards, please use North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541611, Administration Management and General Management Consulting Services.  The mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Pro gram (NGYCP) is to intervene in the lives of at-risk youth between the ages of 16 and 18 years and produce program graduates with the values, skills, education and self-discipline to succeed as adults.  The National Guard Bureau has a need for a full range  of outcome-based operational evaluation and resource management review services for the NGYCP.  The objective of the NGYCP is to identify an independent evaluator who would report annually on the program operational and fiscal outcomes and impacts.  The a ssessment would determine whether or not the life skills and employment potential of civilian youth who ceased to attend secondary school before graduation were significantly improved through military-based training, including supervised work experience in  service to the community and conservation projects.  This assessment would also document whether it is feasible and cost effective for the National Guard to provide military-based training to such youth for the purpose of obtaining such improvements.  The  requirements based evaluation process is envisioned to use data management and reporting tools within a secure data repository to improve the accuracy and timeliness of collecting and distributing useful analytics for both program operations and resource management actives for each program location.  The evaluation process also should provide invaluable anecdotal data to capture the unique essence of each program.  The Presidents Management Agenda and the Government Performance and Results Act are integra l to program evaluation models.  It is vital to have a superior understanding of the Federal and State accounting regulations, processes, integral controls, and requirements under regulatory guidance.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to procure on a full and open competition basis research and development services to design and prototype Small Antenna Systems (SAS) units for use with GPS receivers. Due to space constraints, current rotary-wing military platforms utilize GPS antenna systems with no inherent jamming resistance. The program objective is to increase the GPS jamming immunity available to these platforms by developing one or more anti-jam antenna system solutions to accommodate the differing installation requirements of the various end- users. The SAS must be backward-compatible with the existing user equipment for the intended platform(s). SSC-SD anticipates issuing multiple completion type contracts in support of this effort. The expected funding is several million dollars for a multi-year program that is intended to develop production representative units. A survey of the industry response to an SAS RFI in Aug 2006 suggests that the most favorable end-to-end solutions may not reside with a single vendor. Therefore, company teaming is encouraged to exploit the promising antenna or signal processing technologies of separate firms in common system-level solutions. Access to portions of the solicitation resulting from this announcement shall require a facility clearance of secret.  Interested parties lacking a secret facility clearance will not have access to all specifications under this project. The Contracting Officer has determined the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this procurement to be 541710. Selection will be based on a best value source selection using a trade-off process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.1.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (NOV 2001), lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.   All portions of the solicitation not requiring a secret clearance will be available for download via the Internet World Wide Web at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central Business Opportunity Page, Systems Center - San Diego, Open Solicitations, https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil/.

Estimated RFP issuance is by the end of the week following, but no specific date will be provided.  The point of contact for this procurement is Oralee Martin, at oralee.martin@navy.mil  Portions of the solicitation requiring a secret clearance will be mailed to the cleared facility in accordance with government procedures for external transfer of classified material.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.

  ?The desired floor scheme is Plan A (or a developed plan of same or larger size that meets the user?s requirements).  If the offeror can provide Plan A or larger within the funds available, only one cost proposal is required.  However, if the offeror determines that Plan B is the largest that can be provided within the funds available, then provide cost proposals for both A and B only.  And if the offeror determines that Plan C (the smallest footprint) is the largest that can be provided within funding limitation, then provide estimates for all three scenarios.

<DESC>The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) is an independent Federal government agency with responsibility for the oversight of the Department of Energy (DOE)?s defense nuclear facilities located throughout the United States.  The Board?s accounting function is provided by a federal Government service provider.  The service provider performs all of the Board?s accounting entries into their accounting system; the system data serves as the Board?s official accounting records from which all official financial data and reports (e.g., financial statements) are generated.  However, the Board has historically maintained an independent internal financial tracking system.  The Board requires a new client-server Windows-based system using current technology that can be easily modified from an available Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) system.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential sources capable of providing such a COTS system.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation notice for proposals and the Board reserves the right not to issue a solicitation or award a contract as a result of this notice; thus FIRMS SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE BY REQUESTING TO BE PLACED ON A SOLICITATION MAILING LIST.  Interested sources should respond to this notice by providing a brief (not to exceed seven (7) pages) overview of the company and a summary description of the existing COTS system, to include the existing functionality and required modifications to meet the Board?s draft requirements (reference the draft Statement of Work posted with this synopsis).  In addition, the submitted information shall include references of current customers utilizing the COTR product. 

The requested information shall be submitted via electronic mail to markw@dnfsb.gov by 4:00 p.m. on June 29, 2007.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice and respondents will not be notified of the results of the Board?s review of the submitted information.

<DESC>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking sources to perform centralized end user customer support  to military medical treatment facilities at geographically-disperse CONUS/OCONUS Air Force Bases (AFBs).  The service is known as Global Helpdesk.  The work is to provide tier 0/1 helpdesk services.  


Background:  Currently, medical treatment facilities (MTF) offer tier 0/1 helpdesk operations in disparate ways throughout the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) using contractors, Government Service civilians, active duty military, or a combination of all of the above.  The mission of the AFMSCC is to determine the best acquisition strategies that save money, reduce overhead costs and standardize service for all MTFs.  The acquisition strategy is yet to be determined but includes the type of contract instruments, small business strategy, use of the Air Force NETCENTS contract and other considerations.  
The Air Force is very early in the development of this acquisition strategy and seeks large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that industry can offer for anticipated helpdesk services.  Capacity includes worldwide, 24/7 helpdesk support for a large number of users.  Capability includes strategies to provide services across disparate DoD facilities while managing DoD security requirements in addition to servicing both desktop (office), clinical and various DoD applications.  In addition, we are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection.  
What the AFMSCC needs:  If your business is interested in providing input to this acquisition program, please respond to the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and email address of a company representative we may contact for additional information.  Notice:  The AFMSCC may have non-Government employees (i.e., contractor employees) assisting with our market research.  These non Government employees, who have all signed non disclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  If you are a small business, please identify your firm as such, together with any subcategory that applies (e.g., small disadvantaged business, 8a, HUB Zone small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business).  Emailed responses are preferred but paper submittals are acceptable.  Send responses to the following POC within 10 business days of the date of this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase 30 each of the Diode, Transorb, from Protek Devices, P/N SMCC44116C. Radiation Systems Inc. (RSI) was the original sub-contractor to Lockhheed Martin and developed the NEXRAD Power Amplifier drawer (R400-5A7).  RSI went out of business and DRS Surveillance Systems Inc, (DRS) purchased the data rights to the R400-5A7. DRS granted a production license to Protek Devices to produce the Transorb Diode (R400-5A7CR5), which includes special production deviations for these devices when used with NEXRAD.  The NWS has performed a market search for vendors that can produce the required Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) part number G44116C, but none were found.  The Protek part number SMCC44116C satisfies the requirements for the Transorb diode and includes the required production deviations specified by the original product vendor, Lockheed Martin.  No other vendor is able to legally produce the R400-5A7CR5 Transorb diode for use in the NEXRAD Power Amp drawer. Because the Government does not have the data rights to remanufacture this part, it is recommended to purchase the item by part number.  This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO.  The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Protek Devices, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified diode or a diode that provides the same fit, form and function as that specified. Any responses that  provide for a part other than that specified must be accompanied by descriptive literature and certified test results that show it meets the same form, fit and function of the part number specified P/N SMCC44116C. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For information and to register, please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet number.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request For Information - Bankruptcy Noticing Center Contract
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-07-BCAD-01
<RESPDATE>031607
<CONTACT>Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-502-1574, Fax 202-502-1066, Email Michelle_Hupp@ao.uscourts.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information for the purposes of conducting market research and to identify qualified entities to operate the Federal Judiciary Bankruptcy Noticing Center program.  This RFI is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the BNC program needs. This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. A  Request for Proposals will follow in the near future.

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has identified a performance based requirement for services and support for the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts. The services provided by the BNC program include, but are not limited to, receiving bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, producing bankruptcy notices, distributing notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, in the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and providing program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.

The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is done by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees. Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process. The BNC is able to generate notices at a fraction of the time and cost that would be required if produced by local courts. Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients. Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008. A solicitation and resulting contract award will replace the existing contract for the BNC.

Detailed information is provided in the draft PWS. A link to the document appears below.  Please note that all Section J attachment will be provided upon issuance of the Request for Proposals.

Vendor information should be submitted which provides high level information about the company, including years in business, experience providing capabilities outlined in the draft PWS, and other information deemed relevant.  Links to a website or marketing materials are acceptable as long as the information is easy to discern from other materials submitted.

Responses shall be limited to a total of 25 pages and must be completed in Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or Adobe PDF format.  

We will not divulge individual responses to the RFI outside of the Judiciary BNC evaluation team. 

Time and Date of Submittal:

Information submitted in response to this Request for Information should be submitted electronically no later than March 16, 2007.  All submittals shall be addressed to Michelle_Hupp@ao.uscourts.gov

Questions:

Questions regarding this Request for Information will be accepted in writing ONLY. No telephonic questions will be accepted.    Questions should be addressed to Michelle_Hupp@ao.uscourts.gov.

Project involves the installation of new HVAC systems and ductwork in the three (3) buildings shown, and includes the installation of t-bar ceiling and moving existing lighting and sprinklers to accommodate the new suspended ceiling.  These buildings currently do not have any or minimal ductwork and so this work would need to include the duct work system and an HVAC system.  VA needs to consider energy efficient HVAC models and meeting guidelines for such systems as set forth in LEEDS "Silver" as a minimum.  LEEDS certification is not required but striving to meet the standards is essential.  Higher level of energy efficient systems will be considered versus capital costs.  Estimated construction cost for all three (3) buildings is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Services will include Phase I involving the preliminary investigative services; Phase II involving the preparation of construction contract drawings and specifications for construction bidding purposes, with electronic format submission after completion of Phase II; and Phase III will be for construction period services during actual construction work.  Evaluation factors to be considered will be (1) Specialized experience of the firm with similar contracts; (2) Past record of performance on similar contracts; (3) Geographical location and facilities of the working office; (4) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to this project.  NAICS: 541310/Size Standard $4.5 million.  This is a set aside for small, emerging veteran owned business for firms located within the State of Oregon.  Firms interested and desiring consideration shall submit Standard Form 330 by close of business, July 5, 2007 to the Contracting Officer shown above. Award is pending availability of funds.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement.  This is not a request for proposal, quotation or bid. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers desires to identify capable of planning and completing the demolition of the Walson Army Hospital, located on Fort Dix, NJ as described below. The Government will use the responses to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  Interested sources should respond with a capability statement, list of similar projects, and references, along with documentation of their socio-economic classifications (i.e., 8(a), Hubzone certified, and service disabled veteran owned small business contractors).  Fort Dix is a permanent United States Army installation located in Burlington County, New Jersey. The former Walson Army Hospital is located wi thin the Cantonment Area of the Fort Dix Army Installation.  The site is located approximately 20 miles southeast of Trenton, New Jersey. The Walson complex is comprised of the eleven (11) story Walson Hospital (Building 5250), the one (1) story Refrigerat ion and Air Conditioning Plant (Building 5251), and Heating Plant (Building 5252). The site is bounded by Maryland Avenue (east), North Scott Plaza (north), New Jersey Avenue (west), and Walson Avenue (south). The Walson Hospital is approximately 384,057 s quare feet. The Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Plant is approximately 2,170 square feet and contains two chiller units, an exterior cooling tower, and associated exterior and interior piping to support the hospital cooling system. The Boiler Plant comp rises 5,693 square feet. The Walson Hospital was constructed in 1960 in three wings (A, B, and C-Wing) as an actively occupied full care health facility for the U. S. Army. In the 1970s new wings were added to the hospital (D and E Wings) and the hospital  was expanded on the 1st Floor (A Wing) to include the New Clinic, Air Evacuation and Headquarters Wing (Personal Communication, 1999).  Walson ceased operation as an Army Hospital in 1992. OBJECTIVE The objective of this project is to plan and complete th e demolition of Buildings 5250, 5251, and 5252. This demolition will be accomplished in phases. The first phase will include the planning, assessment and remediation of asbestos containing material and other hazardous materials. Additionally, the Contracto r shall plan and complete the closure of utilities associated with Buildings 5250, 5251, and 5252, which will include the rerouting of utilities associated with nearby facilities. The second phase shall include the building demolition, parking lot demoliti on, debris removal, and site restoration. As part of this effort, concrete, brick and paving material from Building 5250 (Walton Hospital) will be maintained in a wet condition until loaded on trucks, not recycled, and disposed of at an approved state land fill in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations. Brick and concrete from Buildings 5251 and 5252 can be crushed on site to a size suitable for compacted fill and used as compacted fill in the void left by the building. See Tabl e # 1 for the list of hazardous materials.

<SUBJECT>A -- MAGNETO-OPTICAL TRAP ION SOURCE (MOTIS)
<DESC>DEVELOPMENTS AT NIST**

This is NOT an announcement of a contract action or a grant. 

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are working on the following technology.  For further information, contact the:  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Office of Technology Partnerships, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 2200, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899; Fax:  301-975-3482.  

NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 07-015.

The invention consists of a new source for creating a focused ion beam. A magneto-optical trap serves as a source of cold atoms that are photo ionized to produce the ion source. Under appropriate conditions, the resulting ion cloud has temperature and spatial characteristics similar to that of the initial neutral atom cloud. An external electric field extracts the ions which can be focused using standard charged-particle optics. The cold temperatures achieved through laser cooling yield an ion beam with excellent characteristics which should allow for a beam resolution of 10 nm or less. The current produced from this source depends on the operating parameters of the MOT and can range from single ions on demand to over 100 pA, a much wider range than is currently possible. In addition, the wide range of elements that can be laser cooled greatly extends the possibilities for ionic species that can be used in FIBs, The net result is a source that has improved characteristics as well as expanded capabilities over current technology.

<SUBJECT>99 -- GUAM INDUSTRY FORUM
<DESC>Request for Information Notice: 
Department of the Navy, 

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), in support of the Joint Guam Program Office, is soliciting information from all sources related to the potential design, construction, and logistics effort proposed in support of the relocation of Command, Air, Ground, and Logistics units of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (which includes approximately 8,000 service members and 9,000 family members) from Okinawa, Japan to Guam.  The proposed construction effort also includes infrastructure and pier/waterfront facilities to construct a Nuclear Carrier-capable berth at Naval Base Guam.  In addition, a U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Defense Task Force, consisting of approximately 630 service members and 950 family members, is proposed to be located on Guam.                                                          
                                                                  
NAVFAC anticipates a multi-billion dollar construction effort to occur over a period of approximately five to eight years.  The purpose of this Request for Information Notice is to begin obtaining information from industry to assist in planning and programming for this effort.  Industry input is being sought to guide NAVFAC in formulating acquisition and construction concepts, policies, standards and processes which will lead to procurement plans that deliver the required infrastructure in the most efficient and effective manner.  

Planning for this effort is ongoing and no final decisions have been made with regard to the requirements, siting, or acquisition strategy.  Due to the potential magnitude and location of this effort, however, there may be many unique challenges associated with completing the work.  In order to better anticipate such challenges and ensure that all options for addressing them are considered, NAVFAC is seeking industry questions and comment on the following specific areas: 
(a)	Construction cost factors to include ability to control/estimate material pricing
(b)	Acquisition strategy impact on cost
(c)	Military construction standards for Guam
(d)	Materials procurement and logistics, including shipping and ground transportation
(e)	Construction technologies, including pre-fabricated and pre-cast components, modular construction and sustainable design 
(f)	Workforce availability, training, logistics and management
(g)	Construction equipment availability
(h)	Environmental considerations
(i)	Usefulness of Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure contractor planning and performance,
(j)	Cost control methods and strategies to ensure full scope can be obtained for the programmed amount. 
Industry comments, questions, and suggestions addressing the foregoing areas, or other areas pertaining to the proposed construction efforts are sought.

Additionally, NAVFAC is sponsoring an industry forum on Guam, 23-24 August 2007.   The industry forum will include presentations by the various agency personnel involved in the acquisition planning, discussion of input received in response to this RFI, and opportunities for industry to meet with Government officials and to provide input.  The facility location, agenda, and registration information are yet to be determined and will be announced separately. 

All comments or questions as a result of this notice should be sent to:

Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Marianas
Attn:  Acquisition - Guam Industry Forum (GIF) Team 
PSC 455 Box 195
FPO AP 96540-2937

or by e-mail to:  GIF@navfacmar.navy.mil.  

  Responses are requested not later than 30 June 2007.

This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be issued at this time.  All information submitted is at the offeror's own expense.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information Notice.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.
_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
SCOPE
This effort is to provide acquisition support services to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Contractor personnel shall not perform inherently Governmental activities.  The Government contemplates a single award for one (1) full-time position for a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) option, not to exceed one (1)year, for either one (1) full-time position or one (1) part-time position.
The Contracts and Procurement Section desires to procure the services of a Senior Contract Specialist for acquisition support.  The Contract Specialist shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.
OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this statement of work is to provide acquisition support services to the NLRB?s Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC.  Specifically, the Contractor shall provide experienced and qualified expertise, on a level that is equivalent to DAWIA level II or III, to provide the acquisition support and assistance identified in the statement of work.  The Contractor shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.  Work assignments shall be made with the expectation that the Contract Specialist will be able to complete assignments independently.
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
Work for this contract will be performed at the NLRB?s 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC office.  The Government expects the benefit of Government Site Rates for personnel working on a Government site, where the Government provides office space and normal business facilities for use by Contractor personnel.
Contractor personnel are expected to conform to the Government client?s normal hours of operation.  Normal hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the core hours from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  During the base period, the Contractor is expected to work eight (8) hours a day, Monday through Friday, during the core hours.  A contractor is expected to be on-site every day, for the full eight (8) hours.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to report, a backup contractor shall report.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to provide a full eight (8) hours of service, in any given day, the hours must be made up prior to the end of the monthly invoice cycle.
During the option period, the Contractor is expected to work a minimum of three (3) days a week.  Hours per week will be determined at exercise of option.  Additional hours may be required during surge periods.  
The NLRB will be closed on the following Federal Holidays:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, President?s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

Actual travel costs, if any that are charged to the government under CLIN 03 will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations and travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations.  (viii)  The selected contractor must be able to deliver all requested equipment within sixty (60) days from receipt of the award document.  Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables for the three particle processors will be FOB destination USDA, NVSL, 1800 Dayton Avenue in Ames, IA  50010. (ix) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. (x) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (xi) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
?	Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the Ambion? MagMAX? paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor.
?	Must be able to process Ambion? MagMAX? paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit
?	Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
?	Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
?	Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
?	Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
?	Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
?	Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
?	Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
?	Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
?	Must have a 1 year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), under RFQ number FA7000-07-T-0164, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.

LINE ITEM 0001:  Low Temperature controller system  , QTY:  1 EA
Please Note:  This is a 52.211-6 Name Brand or Equal Requirement.  Each quote must provide a detailed line item description which must comply with the following specification:

The Department of Chemistry at the US Air Force Academy has a requirement for a Low Temperature Controller system.    The Brand Name that specified is the Oxford Model 700 Cryostream.

The physical, functional or performance characteristics are as follows:

1.  The Temperature controller system must have exceptional laminar flow properties to ensure reduced icing of the crystal.  The gas termperature must be controlled in a coldhead and mapped to the crystal position.   There should not be any heater or sensor probes in the nozzle.  This design provides superior laminar flow characteristics and also allows the nozzle to be oriented at any angle, such as in the inverted phi axis set-up. 

2.	An equivalent system must be designed to provide low liquid nitrogen consumption, allowing a 60L dewar to last up to 4 days without refilling.  The system must include an autofill system, which is designed to be used with the controller system.  The autofill system must provide extended run time to operate over weekends and holidays, and additional benefits of the auto-fill system should include:  less contact with cryogens for students, convernience of a continuous level reading, remote liquid level monitoring from instrument workstation, alarm warning of impending need for replenishing supply cylinder.  
3.	An equivalent system must provide for highly accurate mapping of the temperature at the crystal position.  The unit must have a support stand that has been designed to ensure the coldhead is held in a secure position and that the nozzle can be aligned accurately at the sample position with a minimum of effort.  The stand must be fitted with a leadscrew positioner that allows the cold stream to be positioned at the crystal and then moved away along a sliding scale without losing the critical alignment with the sample.  The stand should be supplied with an XY positioner to allow the position of the cold stream to be finely adjusted to ensure the exact centering of the sample.
4.	The system must provide a minimum temperature range of 80-400 degress Kelvin.
5.	The system must provide temperature stability 0.1 degrees Kelvin.
6.	The system must have a dry air pumping unit capable of providing a variable flow up to 25L/min of dry air with a dew point of -60 degrees C.  It is crucial that the instrument have a laminar flow system which shrouds the cryogenic nitrogen gas stream in a second dry gas stream to prevent atmospheric moisture from freezing on the crystal.
7.	The system must include a 60L stainless steel dewar vessel.

 
No removal of old or installation of new requirement.
Delivery FOB Destination.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541380, identified as FDA-SOL-07-00258, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.
 
STATEMENT OF WORK:
The purpose of this contract is to provide Labview programming support to the CDRH Calibration Laboratory due to the White Oak move and transition to PC based software. Upon completion of programming by vendor, CDRH has ownership and all rights to access and modify the LabView program. Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that CDRH requirements were met. Vendor will provide Labview programming in stages to insure that the quality of work is meeting the needs of the X-ray Calibration Laboratory. 

General requirements 

The computer control system supplies a level of automation over the x-ray system to provide streamlined control, calibration, and monitoring. This automation is focused in four areas: ion 
chamber calibration, exposure rate calculation, automatic set up, and irradiator calibration. The computer control system uses a computer and optically isolated inputs and outputs to monitor 
and control the irradiator. An indexer controls the motors of the positioning track. An IEEE-488.2 card is used to communicate with electrometers. The x-ray system is monitored and 
controlled via an RS-232 connection. 

The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program is LabVIEW, a Windows-based program that is ideally suited for this type of application. It is very 
easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use is presented to the operator. Selection of options is clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components is shown in a concise display. The control software is designed on a modular approach for functions. Operation screens are set up and customized to exactly match an rradiator. Command modules are written for each feature of the irradiator. Because of the modular design, additional features can be added easily and seamlessly after the system has been installed. 

Ion Chamber Calibration. The control system takes the rradiator, ion chambers, and electrometers through a number of steps that result in a calibration data set and report. When this 
process is started, a set up screen appears allowing the operator to configure such things as: source selection and desired exposure rate, electrometer settings of current vs. charge mode, ion chamber voltage, number of exposures, and exposure time. When the operator starts the calibration, the track is moved to position (if the track is automated), the source exposed, and the data collected. The electrometer is polled based on the set up. Data is written to a database as 
each point is finished. When the first ion chamber is completed, exposures begin for the second ion chamber (typically the reference chamber). When the second chamber is finished, the data is written to a spreadsheet and/or a report generated. This routine can be easily modified to fit a customer's specific procedure. 

Exposure Rate Calculation. With the power of the computer available for calculations, the irradiator control system can calculate the track's X-axis distance based on a desired exposure rate. This calculation includes is based on a polynomial equation that precisely matches the measurement data collected for that beam code/current/position combination. When current is changed, the exposure rate for that position is calculated. The same arrangement holds for time and exposure - when one is changed, the other is calculated and displayed. 

Automatic Set-Up. The automatic set up routine speeds up instrument or dosimeter calibration and increases accuracy by quickly configuring the irradiator to match a procedure. With the change of one button, this routine configures source, attenuator, track position or exposure rate, and time or exposure. These configurations are arranged in procedures and steps that the user defines. Whenever the operator changes a step, the irradiator is re-configured to match that step. 

Irradiator Calibration. The irradiator calibration requires that hundreds of data points be collected to determine exposure rates for distances along the positioning track. This data must 
be collected for each source and each attenuator. With the computer control system, this process is automated. The computer is connected to the electrometer via IEEE 488.2 interface. The irradiator control system presents a set up screen that allows the operator to specify distances, exposure time, and number of exposures at each position. Once the operator starts the exposure,  the control system performs the exposures at each position, collects the exposure rate from electrometer and saves it to a file. The automated sequence continues until all data is collected. An equation curve fit program is used to fit the data to a polynomial equation. The equation is then coded into the software control program. The computer based control system enhances ease-of-use by automating and simplifying steps of the calibration process. It handles the mundane, repetitive tasks and lets the operator concentrate on the calibration procedure.  The source code is supplied with modification rights for all LabVIEW applications. Support is included for helping adapt the software to FDA's existing techniques and procedures. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One Base (12 month) Year and one (12 month) option year. Base period: August 1, 2007 - July 31, 2008 Option year 1: August 1, 2008 - July 31, 2009

PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past Performance is equal in importance to the Technical/Management Factors. Past Performance information is one indicator of an Offeror?s ability to successfully perform this contract.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establish a level of risk (high, moderate, or low) for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the standing of the Offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.  Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction, timely delivery of services, adherence to contract schedules, subcontractor management, safety management, quality control programs, good workmanship, conformance to specifications, and fair and reasonable prices. 

The Past Performance Questionnaire included as part of the synopsis/solicitation shall be forwarded, by the offeror, to all Construction Team and Design Team references, under Factor 1 and Factor 2, and filled out accordingly.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted, by their references, via electronic submission to Nicole Rounay at Nicole.Rounay@navy.mil.  The questionnaires shall be returned at least one (1) week prior to the proposal due date, but absolutely no later than the proposal due date and time.  Since the Government may contact the individuals identified in Factor 1 and Factor 2, it is critical that these individuals be familiar with the project to answer specific questions regarding your performance.  The Government may choose to contact additional customer(s) not provided by an offeror and may obtain additional information through other sources, such as the Past Performance Retrieval System (PPIRS), and phone interviews.   In addition to references provided under Factor 1 and Factor 2, you may include additional references that are knowledgeable of your firm?s performance.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will focus on information derived from the projects that are most relevant to this project.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in collaboration with the trustees for the Chalk Point oil spill has a requirement for spat-on-shell Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica).  Contractor shall provide live, healthy spat-on-shell Eastern Oysters by setting larvae onto native oyster shell only. 

SCOPE OF WORK:

Setting, Rearing, Transportation And Placement Of Hatchery Seed Spat-On-Shell Of American Oyster (Crassostrea Virginica) For Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project, Maryland.

Introduction

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the lead administrative natural resource trustee for natural resource restoration arising out of the April 7, 2000, pipeline rupture at Pepco?s Chalk Point Generating Facility in Aquasco, Maryland.  The spill released about 140,000 gallons of oil into the Patuxent River and associated shoreline areas.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 authorizes designated Natural Resource Trustees (Trustees) to collect damages from the responsible parties in order to restore the injured natural resources.   Along with NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Trustees.

Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree settling the claims of the United States and state of Maryland for natural resource damages (United States v. Potomac Electric Power Co.), monies were provided to the Trustees to undertake specific restoration projects. One of those projects entailed creation of a five-acre oyster sanctuary known as the Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project. The oyster sanctuary is intended to partially compensate for lost ecological services to fish, shellfish, benthic communities, and birds. An entity within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Restoration Center (RC), has been designated as the lead implementing trustee for this project on behalf of the Trustees 

The project consists of a site within the Patuxent River with suitable bottom known as Kitt?s Marsh in the general area between Broomes Island and Sheridan Point. The approximately 5-acresite site was planted with about a 4-inch layer of dredged oyster shell and fines in the summer of 2003 to prepare it to receive spat-on-shell hatchery oyster seed.  The site was seeded with 10 million spat-on-shell oyster seed in June of 2004, and monitoring has occurred since.  Monitoring has shown relatively low initial survival of planted oysters, with stabilization over the last year to a density of 58 per meter squared, with little fouling and minimal disease detected.  Mean size of the single year class of oysters was 77mm in October of 2006.  A minimal amount of natural spatset occurred during the summer of 2006.

Based on these current density levels, and the desire to have the sanctuary be made up of multiple year classes of oysters, the Trustees have determined that it is appropriate to proceed with the planned second seeding in year 4 rather than wait until the initially presumed need for re-planting in year 5.  In a slight deviation from the original plan, the Trustees have also determined that it is advantageous to spread the remaining planting total out over a number of years, to further improve the year class diversity on the site, and to bet-hedge against potential future adverse environmental events. 

Statement of Need

Eyed larvae will be purchased or spawned by the contractor and set on shell in an appropriate oyster setting facility.  Following setting and tank grow-out, the spat-on-shell will be transported to the shelled site and planted on the bottom throughout the 5-acre site.  The required deliverable is 2 million spat-on-shell per year for each of 5 consecutive years. See below for base and option periods.

This Scope of Work is limited to that portion of the NRDA Chalk Point Oyster Restoration Project including the setting, rearing, transport and placement of hatchery seed onto the designated sanctuary site.

Terms

Setting and Rearing of Hatchery Seed
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Contact a weekly progress report on the setting and growth rates of hatchery seed throughout the sequenced setting and growout periods.
	- Epidemiology samples of 30-35 spat will be collected from each setting batch when the spat attain 7-10 mm in size and sent to the DNR Oxford laboratory for disease analysis.  Disease results shall be made available to the NOAA RC Technical Contact within 10 days from the date samples are received at the laboratory, unless otherwise notified.
	- The maximum desired number of spat per shell is 15.  Any individual shells with spat counts higher than 15 shall be counted as no more than 15 towards the total deliverable.
	- The spat shall be tank-reared or cage-deployed for a period of not less than 2 weeks (three weeks optimally) from settlement prior to removal for transport and seeding.  This is intended to minimize handling and desiccation mortalities, and limit early post settlement mortality.
	- Oyster setting facility staff will determine the number of spat produced no more than 10 days prior to being planted using methodology approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact. The NOAA RC Technical Contact shall have the right to be present and to conduct subset counts of spat-on-shell samples prior to transport and planting.

Land Transportation of Hatchery Seed to Planting Vessel
	- Hatchery seed will not be planted until approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact upon their review of the epidemiology results.
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Coordinator a minimum notice of 48 hours prior to each planting date.
	

Vessel Transportation and Placement of Hatchery Seed
	- The contractor shall provide for vessel transportation and placement of hatchery seed to the designated sanctuary site (Kitt?s Marsh in the Patuxent River north of Broomes Island).  The vessel will be required to have onboard a light colored tarp and water pump in case their use is needed to reduce desiccation of hatchery seed.
	- NOAA RC in conjunction with MDNR will be responsible for adequately marking the designated planting area with buoys.
	- The Contractor will be responsible for supervising the loading and unloading the spat-on-shell onto the planting vessel, and transporting and planting the hatchery seed onto the designated planting area.  Hatchery seed will be planted in a manner approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact to obtain an equal distribution of hatchery seed throughout the designated planting area.
	
Deliverables and Schedule

The contractor shall produce, transport and place 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site.

The first hatchery seed planting shall occur no earlier than no later than September 30, 2007, unless approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact.  At the discretion of the Government the contractor may be directed to proceed in each subsequent year (2008 through 2011) with planting 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site between June and September each year.

A report of this project will be submitted to the NOAA RC Technical Contact by October 15, 2007, and each option year thereafter, if exercised.   The information in this report will include, but not limited to, detailed summary of the number and date of larvae received, larvae setting efficiency rates, spat growth rates, epidemiology results, number of spat produced and date planted, and itemization of the costs associated with this project.

SCOPE OF WORK: 
Background:   Rapid advances in understanding the patterns of human genetic variation and maturing methods for genotyping are providing powerful research tools for identifying genetic variants that contributed to health and disease.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes that the full value of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can only be realized if the genotype and phenotype datasets derived from these studies are made available as rapidly as possible to a wide range of scientific investigators.  GWAS data release practices must also be consistent with the informed consent provided by individual participants and just protect the privacy and confidentiality of the research participants.  The NIH is seeking to develop a specific data-sharing policy for GWAS, across its Institutes and Centers, to harmonize the practices through which data will be made available widely and freely available for research. The proposed GWAS policy calls for investigators funded by the NIH to submit de-identified genetic data to a centralized NIH GWAS repository.  

During the initial phase of policy development, a trans-NIH working group established a GWAS policy website, provided background information on the policy initiative for internal and external audiences, and solicited and analyzed input on from investigators, patients, and other interested parties via a Request for Information (August 2006) and an NIH Town Hall Meeting (December 2006).  The proposed policy and public commentary involves complex and sensitive issues related to participant privacy concerns, FOIA requirements, potential risks and benefits for participants, informed consent or reconsent of patients to permit access to their genetic data, publication rights of investigator, intellectual property rights of scientists, and data access and data management procedures.  

The next phase of the policy development involves the refinement, finalization, launch, and implementation of the policy.  These next steps will be based on the input from the Request for Information and NIH Town Hall Meeting; background research on:  informed consent and reconsent; the preparation of informed consent and re-consent guidance; a conference on data security issues and future research needs in the consent / re-consent area; the development of a communications plan; and preparation of presentation and other background materials for external and internal audiences.

The trans-NIH working group is chaired by the Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, (NHLBI). The GWAS Project Management Team is led by the Deputy Director, NHLBI, who works in collaboration with senior officials in the NIH Office of Science Policy and the Office of the Director, National Human Genome Research Institute.  Input is solicited from all affected Institutes and Centers at the NIH via working groups throughout the policy development process.

Statement of Work: Specifically the Contractor Shall:
Provide support to finalize the NIH GWAS data sharing policy.  Specific tasks include:
?	Continuing support of the GWAS Project Management Team, which involves:  meeting scheduling, agenda development, meeting material production, meeting follow-up such as analysis of meeting outcomes, policy finalization timeline creation, tracking of policy related items and meetings, and continuing communication with relevant policy members.  This will include editing/modifying the policy preamble to reflect public comments and editing/modification of points to consider for policy users.
?	Continuing support for the identification of implementation and resource issues regarding the GWAS policy which involves:  drafting of FAQs; drafting Informed Consent template examples; researching how other repositories have dealt with reconsent and how much the reconsent process is likely to cost in staff time and other resources; and how the informed consent information should be communicated.  Also includes planning a one-day conference for data users regarding a proposed Informed Consent template, data security issues, and future research needs on consent/reconsent; development of an online security training module; updating of the GWAS website; and coordinating, circulating, and tracking of background information about Certificates of Confidentiality and FOIA exemptions with the NIH working groups.  
?	Continuing support for communications and rollout steps and logistics which includes:  drafting PowerPoint presentation, updating the communication plan, updating web site content, and after policy release, providing support to the governance committees by setting up initial meetings and providing background information.
?	The contractor must be able to handle the complex and specialized nature of the project and have the full capability to support all aspects in a short timeframe.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.
_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
SCOPE
This effort is to provide acquisition support services to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Contractor personnel shall not perform inherently Governmental activities.  The Government contemplates a single award for one (1) full-time position for a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) option, not to exceed one (1)year, for either one (1) full-time position or one (1) part-time position.
The Contracts and Procurement Section desires to procure the services of a Senior Contract Specialist for acquisition support.  The Contract Specialist shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.
OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this statement of work is to provide acquisition support services to the NLRB?s Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC.  Specifically, the Contractor shall provide experienced and qualified expertise, on a level that is equivalent to DAWIA level II or III, to provide the acquisition support and assistance identified in the statement of work.  The Contractor shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.  Work assignments shall be made with the expectation that the Contract Specialist will be able to complete assignments independently.
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
Work for this contract will be performed at the NLRB?s 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC office.  The Government expects the benefit of Government Site Rates for personnel working on a Government site, where the Government provides office space and normal business facilities for use by Contractor personnel.
Contractor personnel are expected to conform to the Government client?s normal hours of operation.  Normal hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the core hours from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  During the base period, the Contractor is expected to work eight (8) hours a day, Monday through Friday, during the core hours.  A contractor is expected to be on-site every day, for the full eight (8) hours.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to report, a backup contractor shall report.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to provide a full eight (8) hours of service, in any given day, the hours must be made up prior to the end of the monthly invoice cycle.
During the option period, the Contractor is expected to work a minimum of three (3) days a week.  Hours per week will be determined at exercise of option.  Additional hours may be required during surge periods.  
The NLRB will be closed on the following Federal Holidays:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, President?s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
This effort will consist of a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) year option.  The estimated start date for the base period will be 21 May 2007.  The option period, if exercised, would begin on October 1, 2007.

PART I, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR TEXTUAL RECORDS DIGITATION ENVIRONMENT 1.0  INTRODUCTION The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all equipment and labor necessary to procure operational new workstations that will provide an expanded capability for the digitization/scanning of textual records at Archives II in College Park Maryland.  The workstations include the accompanying server/software and data deliverables and maintenance of the workstations for a base year with two possible option years described in this statement of work, along with industry standard warranties for the equipment and system.  Existing work stations as described below will also be required to integrate with the new workstations. Statement of Need, Background and Objectives: The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of textual records. Currently, the Microfilm Camera Lab of the Special Media Preservation Laboratory operates sixteen (16) traditional planetary-style 35mm microfilm cameras. We anticipate replacing these microfilm cameras over a period of several years with new digital camera systems with indexing software to be used for digitizing a variety of original records. The NWTS labs operate two microfilm scanners (an older roll-film scanner and a newer microfiche scanner) and needs to expand microfilm scanning capabilities. Also, the labs use several high-speed document scanners. All these systems need to be integrated into an environment for digitizing and indexing textual records using a software application for workflow management and document indexing. The existing Special Media Preservation (NWTS) Environment. The NWTS Labs are creating a local area network (LAN) which is comprised of lab equipment (scanners, digital cameras, printers, audio and video capture and playback devices) and the computers used to host the applications that run these devices, as well as the digital storage systems to hold the digital output and servers that manage this entire array of devices. Each lab (audio and video, still photo/digital imaging/aerial/cartographic, motion picture, microfilm camera, and microfilm duplication) has workstations used to capture and prepare digital output from the reformatting devices. The digital resources are saved to a local network attached storage (NAS) server (typically 6 TB to 7 TB of RAID-5 storage with tape back-up and an uninterruptible power supply) that is dedicated to each lab for short-term storage. Digital resources saved to the NAS servers are backed up daily to LTO tapes by project, and copies of the tapes are transferred to protected storage for the duration of the project. Quality control checks are made by technicians during the course of a project and at its completion.  Once approved, the project resources (digital files and related metadata) will be transferred to a centralized storage area network (SAN) managed by NARAs IT department. Daily LTO backups are made of data stored on the SAN. Due to the necessity of choosing workstations and operating systems based upon lab equipment and application needs, servers running Active Directory (Microsoft) and Open Directory (Apple Computing) are used simultaneously to manage the lab network environment.

5.	Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications: 

The Secretary of Defense Communications Critical Infrastructure Branch has a legal requirement and obligation to provide information as requested in a timely manner for Freedom of Information Act and Congressional Inquiries. The ability to store a large amount of data for review on a system that can be integrated and migrated between production networks without network interruption is critical to completing these tasks. 

a.	The storage solution must be able to operate as 2 independently operated systems capable of being joined together with populated data to form a single storage system. 

b.	 The storage system must be able to physically break apart into multiple independently operated sub-systems to reallocate storage as needed for any reasonable search request.

c.	The system must be capable of hosting a minimum of 40TB of data in a contiguous NTFS volume. And be expandable to a minimum of 66TB

d.	The storage solution must be capable of communicating with production server systems utilizing I-SCSI protocol and Microsoft ISCSI initiators.

e.	The storage solution must utilize interoperable SATA AND SAS disk technology that is compatible with data drives in use in the Secretary of Defense environment.

f.	The storage solution must minimize rack space by accommodating a minimum of 12 Disks of 750GB SATA drives per enclosure capable of being rack mounted within a standard 2 rack unit space. 

g.	The system must be fault-tolerant with dual power supplies, RAID redundancy and Hot-Spare disks.

h.	The system must support point-in-time snapshoting of data.

i.	The system needs to have  the following security features;  Kerberos Authentication v5, ACL Security for Users and Groups;  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit Encryption; CHAP Authentication (iSCSI target level) 

j.	The Vendor must be able to provide onsite support for the product line.


Based on these requirements, Adaptec provides the most appropriate storage system that meets all of the minimum requirements. The Adaptec SnapServer 520 series family of Network Attached Storage combined with the modular SanBloc Series 50 JBOD Disk enclosures is capable of multiple configurations with a dense 1U and 2U rack mountable form factor. The Snapserver NAS can support up to 9TB per enclosure with SATA disks. The Snap server uses a 64Bit AMD Opteron processor with Adaptec?s Guardian OS Software. The operating system includes advanced storage features such as snapshoting and expansion of live volumes using I.C.E for flexible storage. The operating system also provides a feature of native server to server replication that will preclude purchase of additional software to complete the search project. The snapserver has dual ported imbedded 1 gigabit NICs capable of fault tolerant configuration along with dual power supplies for each device allowing the hardware to be connected to redundant independent critical power circuits. Adaptec can provide the support services required for maintaining the equipment onsite without removing sensitive data external to the secure environment.  The Snapserver line supports the ISCSI protocols and initiators of production systems that would be integrated with it. 


Companies who can provide the above listed hardware must submit their quote not later than COB 14 June 2007 via the following address: TARA.WHITAKER@DISA.MIL. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order awarded to the lowest cost/technically acceptable quote. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered. The NAICS code is 423430 for this procurement.*****

<DESC>1.	Question:	What are the breakdowns of quantities per different cubicle types and/or sizes?  No panels or components have been drawn in the floor plan provided. Answer:	Drawings that I have provided show general configuration of the workstation size only.  Not detailed furniture assembly drawings.  Contractor is responsible for any drawings necessary to achieve the general configuration shown.  We did not know details of furniture being acquired, therefore could only provide general size requirements. 2.	Question:	Will we be given full 1/4 inch scale industry standard drawings to build by?  Answer:	The 1/8 inch scale drawings are all you will get from DPW.  If contractor needs additional drawings to achieve assembly to the general configuration shown on these drawings, then contractor must be tasked to complete the drawings. 	 3.	Question:	Is Fort Sill prepared to receive excess product and do they have a warehouse staging area we can work from as the products required will undoubtedly get mixed in with the excess?    Answer:	Yes, Fort Sill is prepared to receive the excess products.  4.	Question:	Do you relocate only what Ft. Sill needs now and the balance later, or do we relocate everything all at once? 	Answer:	Relocate everything all at once. 5.	Question:	The Statement of Work says the Government may have the manufacturer disassemble and reassemble the systems furniture, and yet the CLINS specify disassembly and reassembly of same.  Which is it? Answer:	Contractor will disassemble, transport and reassemble the furniture as identified in the CLIN lines. *Contractors must acknowledge this modification when submitting a bid response.
