<DESC>Contracting Office Address
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E226, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services to continue the collection of fresh frozen breast tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides in three hospitals from The Chinese Hospital of Hong Kong, <br />4/F School of Public Health, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong SAR, China.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is estimated to be as follows:</p>
<p>February 6, 2017 - February 5, 2018</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The NCI is conducting a molecular epidemiology study by collecting normal and breast tumor tissues from breast cancer cases who are enrolled in an ongoing breast cancer case-control study (Night shift and breast cancer: a case-control study among Hong Kong women) led by The Chinese University in Hong Kong (CUHK). Eligible cases in the nightshift and breast cancer case-control study are identified from the Surgery or Oncology Departments of hospitals in Hong Kong. Each case is frequency-matched in five-year age groups to a hospital control who is randomly selected from the same hospital where the case comes from. All cases and controls are Chinese females, and all controls have no history of a physician-diagnosed cancer at any site. Approximately 1,000 incident female breast cancer cases and 1,000 age-matched controls have been recruited into the case-control study by the end of year 2013. Questionnaire data (including basic socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime habits of smoking and alcohol drinking, dietary habits and intake of supplements, anthropometric risk factors, reproductive factors, history of benign breast diseases, family cancer history of breast cancer, occupational and recreational physical activity, etc.) and blood are being collected from each participating subject. So far, the NCI has collected fresh frozen tissue from ~300 breast cancer cases.</p>
<p><br />The overall goals of the NCI breast tissue study are: 1) to characterize molecular profile using detailed molecular profiling approaches and classify tumors into subtypes; 2) to examine the relationship between age onset and molecular/morphologic changes in normal breast tissues, tumor subtypes, breast cancer risk factors (including genetic and environmental), and clinical characteristics; and 3) to identify tumor subtype-specific risk factors using data in this study as well as data collected from other Asian studies. The specific aim for this procurement is to continue the collection of fresh frozen breast tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides in three hospitals.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Obtain written inform consent from study participants for tissue collection;</p>
<p>2. Collect fresh frozen breast tissues (two non-malignant and one tumor) and five 10um sections from FFPE blocks (two non-malignant and one tumor);</p>
<p>3. Store collected tissues properly (fresh frozen tissues in liquid nitrogen and FFPE tissue slides in tubes at room temperature) until the shipment to NCI;</p>
<p>4. Ship the tissue samples to NCI every 6 months;</p>
<p>5. Share clinical and epidemiologic data with NCI COR.</p>
<p><br />Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is uniquely qualified to perform this work for the following reasons: 1) The goal of this study is to identify breast cancer subtypes in a unique Asian population. The work requires the collection of fresh frozen tissues which is unachievable in most hospitals due to the limited research capacity and excessive burden to the pathology lab. In addition, the NCI needs epidemiologic data for the NCI's research. CUHK is conducting a breast cancer case-control breast cancer study with a careful and comprehensive collection of clinical and risk factor data as well as blood for germline DNA from a large number of cases and controls. It would be the most efficient approach for the NCI to conduct a breast tissue study taking advantage of this existing resource and infrastructure; 2) Breast cancer patients will be recruited from CUHK-associated hospitals; no known commercial company has access to these patients. The NCI has previously successfully collected paired normal and tumor tissues from 300 invasive breast cancer cases. The NCI was able to obtain questionnaire data and clinical information for all these cases. Genomic DNA and total RNA extracted from these samples showed excellent quantity and quality, which demonstrates the high quality of the NCI tissue collection and storage process.</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST, on January 17, 2017. All responses and questions can be emailed to Kimesha Leake, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at kimesha.leake@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02CP72511-24 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Diapharma Group, Inc., 8948 Beckett Rd, West Chester, OH, 45069-2939, to procure electrode test cells, as well as other materials (i.e. liquid control sets to test the system electronics), that fit with the Population Sciences Branch's Multiplate impedance aggregometry system for testing blood samples.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Dr. Andrew D. Johnson, part of the Population Sciences Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, is involved in the study of blood diseases and genetic associations for measurable blood traits. The lab is particularly focused on the biology of platelet reactivity and population variation and associations with such measures. As part of the research, the lab requires collection of new Platelet Reactivity and Blood Cell count data in the NHLBI Framingham Heart Study. The lab must test both platelet rich plasma (PRP) aggregometry and whole blood based aggregometry which requires 2 different systems. These systems are tested separately because whole blood provides the context of platelet reactivity/function when in the environment of other cell types (e.g., white cells). Platelet reactivity data collected at population scales (i.e., thousands of samples) is rare in research studies. These data will provide Government scientists a valuable resource to make new genetic and epidemiological discoveries relating to Platelet biology, a system that is targeted for many pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the electrode test cells, as well as other materials (i.e. liquid control sets to test the system electronics), that fit with the lab's Multiplate impedance aggregometry system for testing blood samples. This whole blood aggregometry system has been previously purchased by the lab, and must be used because it matches ones that are currently being used by collaborators in Italy and the UK. The equipment used must be the same so that data can be accurately compared across labs.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>For this procurement, the contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>&bull;	Multiplate Test Cells (60 tests/pkg). Quantity 100.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the lab already owns a Multiplate Whole Blood impedance aggregometry system from DiaPharma Group. This system requires proprietary electrode test cells that are not sold by any other vendor. In addition, this system must be used because it matches ones that are currently being used by collaborators in Italy and the UK. The equipment used must be the same so that data can be accurately compared across labs.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-92-1 (December 19th, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by January 12, 2017 at 9:00AM EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-062-KMA.  Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6127, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Kevin Alvarez. Responses may be submitted electronically to kevin.alvarez@nih.gov.  Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<CONTACT>Jerri A. Taylor , Phone 8163893157, Email Jerri.A.Taylor@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The following is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for this requirement. This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on or about January 30, 2017 on the FedBizOps website at www.fbo.gov. This requirement includes a construction project entitled Repair of Wheel Rims for gates 3&amp;4- Tuttle Creek, KS. In accordance with FAR 36.204 and DFARS 236.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is: Between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. The NAICS code for this specialty is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction). The size standard is $33.5 million. This requirement will be a 100% set-aside for small business. This IFB will result in the award of a single Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) construction contract. When this IFB is issued, the solicitation will contain information as to when and where bids will be received and opened. A Bid bond will be required with your bid in the amount of 20% of the bidder proposed price or $3,000,000.00 whichever is less. Payment and Performance bonds will be required for the full amount (100%) of the awarded contract before the NTP can be issued. At this time, no pre-solicitation conference is planned for this solicitation. If the government does elect to hold a pre-solicitation conference, the pre-solicitation announcement will be modified accordingly.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project consists of continued operation of Service Gates 3 and 4 in their current condition with the crack-inherent alloy on the wheel rims will likely eventually result in cracking of the wheel rims. Partial opening of the gates, as practiced in the current operating procedures, places additional stress on the wheel rims and increases the risk of cracking. It is recommended that the welded wheel rims on Service Gates 3 and 4 be replaced with forged wheel rims. The estimated performance period for completion of construction is 540 calendar days from Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>

CNPP's mission is to improve the health of Americans by developing and promoting dietary guidance that links scientific research to the nutrition needs of consumers. The NEL supports CNPP's mission by conducting systematic reviews to inform Federal nutrition policy and programs.<br />A NEL systematic review (SR) is used to evaluate scientific evidence on food and nutrition to answer a precise question or series of questions. In keeping with best SR practices, NEL systematic reviews are conducted by a multidisciplinary research team to: 1) develop systematic review questions 2) search, screen, and select studies to review, 3) extract data and assess the risk of bias of the research, 4) describe and synthesize the evidence, 5) develop conclusion statements and grade the evidence, 6) identify research recommendations. Each step of the process is documented in detail to ensure objectivity, transparency, and reproducibility of the process. CNPP has developed a web-based system called the NEL portal and website to provide the software and web support needed to implement this process to meet current systematic review standards.<br />This system has unique and secure features tailored to the requirements needed to support NEL systematic reviews such as:<br />&bull; Tailored web-based data extraction forms, data management with quality control of data, tailored data display capabilities, web-based forms which support dual completion and adjudication, with built in audit history of tracked changes, linking of data forms to external database records such as PubMed citations, collaborative workspaces to upload and share documents, capabilities to support quantitative data synthesis, and public transparency to 508 compliant systematic review materials via a public website.<br />&bull; Project management tools for workflow support, task assignments and invoicing, scheduling of meetings, discussion boards, calendar and mail functions, metric dashboard, customizable reports, media library, and collaborative workspaces.<br />&bull; Currently uses ColdFusion version 10, along with IIS and SQL Server, with a database size under 5GB.</p>

<DESC>A.	Sources Sought Notice: NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-060-KMA
<p>B.	Title: BZX700 Fluorescence Microscope Purchase</p>
<p>C.	This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.  All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Kevin Alvarez, Contract Specialist, at kevin.alvarez@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by January 13, 2016 9:00 AM, EASTERN TIME under Solicitation Number: NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-060-KMA. FAXES ARE NOT ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>D.	Information:</p>
<p>1.	Background</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Sickle Cell Branch's (SCB)   research examines the genetic factors underlying the phenotypic variability of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia disorders. Both of these conditions are caused by mutations affecting the beta globin gene. A crucial difference between these conditions is that beta thalassemia results from a reduced number of red blood cells, while sickle cell disease results from abnormal "sickle" hemoglobin, or HbS, that makes red blood cells rigid and sickle-shaped, causing acute intermittent pain due to blockages of blood vessels and interruption of oxygen supply to vital organs. The rigid red blood cells are also very fragile and easily destroyed, causing a life-long anemia.</p>
<p>HbF is the blood component primarily responsible for fetal oxygen transport and is present in infants until they are about 6 months old. The persistence of HbF beyond infancy is highly variable. High levels of HbF minimize many complications of sickle cell disease and can increase life expectancy. Drug therapy can reactivate HbF production in both children and adults, reducing the severity of sickle cell and beta thalassemia symptoms.</p>
<p>SCB now hopes to identify and validate genetic and biomarkers that will allow early detection and monitoring of severe sickle cell complications, using new genome technologies and deep phenotyping. They plan to contribute to discovery and development of drugs designed for treatment of sickle cell disease, including those that promote HbF synthesis and inhibit HbS polymerisation. They specifically would like to explore targeting the 6q HBS1L-MYB intergenic enhancers as a genetic therapeutic approach for reactivating fetal hemoglobin. By gaining a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of acute sickle pain, they hope to develop treatments to reduce severity and length of acute vaso-occlusive crises.</p>
<p>2.	Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The type of research that the SCB is conducting requires high quality and repeatable experiments using human neutrophils and other human cell lines commonly facilitated by conventional methods such as classical microscopy and multispectral flow cytometry. Unfortunately, such conventional methods are inconsistent and contain various levels of subjectivity. Such inconsistency and subjectivity are harmful to SCB's sensitive research.</p>
<p>Keyence Corporation recently developed a novel system known as the BZX700 Fluorescence Microscope which significantly improves consistency and reproducibility. The BZX700 is the only system that can act as both an incubator and a deoxygenating chamber thus allowing the user to grow cells within the sealed system and control the cellular environment. The SCB needs to monitor the response of anti-sickling agents on red blood cells under low oxygen conditions, and the BZX700 is the only system that can facilitate this. The purchase of this microscope will allow the SCB to conduct more thorough and accurate experiments, enhancing their ability to fulfill their research mission.</p>

<CONTACT>Jessica T. Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone 2022542274, Email jessica.wilson@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION:<br />This notice is issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Office of University Programs (OUP) to solicit information about potential sources to establish a DHS Quantitative Analysis Training Center.<br />This is a "sources-sought" Request for Information (RFI) synopsis only. This synopsis is a market research tool used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition. All interested parties are encouraged to respond. This RFI is not a solicitation or request for proposals. A contract will not be awarded as a result of responses to this RFI.</p>
BACKGROUND<br />Office of University Programs (OUP) engages the academic community to conduct research and analysis, and provide education and training to enhance the Department of Homeland Security's capabilities. OUP's three focus areas include:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Centers of Excellence</span>: The Centers of Excellence (COEs) are managed by OUP to perform research and development activities to provide critical homeland security tools, technologies, training, and talent (including over 100 tools, technologies, and knowledge products either in pilot studies or use). The COE network is an extended consortium of hundreds of universities, firms, research laboratories, and government agencies that generateground-breaking ideas for new technologies and critical knowledge. All COEs work closely with academia, industry, DHS components, and first-responders to develop customer-driven research solutions to operational homeland security challenges, as well as providing essential training to the next generation of homeland security experts. The COEs' research portfolio is a mix of basic and applied research addressing both short and long-term needs. The COEs' extended network is also available for rapid response efforts.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Workforce and Professional Development</span>: OUP's university-based network promotes education programs to develop essential scientific and technical expertise through a suite of scholarship, fellowships, courses of study, and research opportunities. These programs provide mission-critical training to homeland security practitioners around the country and prepare the next generation of scientific and engineering leaders.<br /><br />Minority Serving Institutions Programs: OUP has developed significant engagements with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) on behalf of DHS and the broader HSE. OUP requires the participation of Minority Serving Institutions in the DHS Centers of Excellence Program both as lead and as partner institutions. MSI Scientific Leadership Awards (SLA) fund the development of homeland security science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (HS-STEM) teaching initiatives, curriculum, and scholarships at MSIs. The DHS Summer Research Team Program for Minority Serving Institutions engages early career faculty, along with undergraduate and graduate students, in research that will provide them opportunities to understand the mission and research needs of DHS.<br /><br />This RFI is to encourage private for-profit and non-profit entities to identify their capabilities to, and suggest how they would, help OUP transition the science, analytical and engineering knowledge and capabilities developed at the COEs and MSIs into the hands of DHS operators in usable formats.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE RESPONDENTS:<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is subject to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, and is issued solely for information/planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals, a commitment to issue a solicitation for proposals, or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information-Investigative Field Work Washington, DC Beltway
<SOLNBR>OPM1517I0001
<RESPDATE>011717
<CONTACT>Rory J. Page, Contract Specialist, Email rory.page@opm.gov - Leslie L. Henderson, Lead Contract Specialist, Email leslie.henderson@opm.gov
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) issued by the Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), on behalf of the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), for the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It seeks to obtain price, delivery, other market information and capabilities for planning purposes only as they relate to contracting for the fieldwork services necessary in completion of its background investigation program. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract nor does it represent that a solicitation will be issued that follows the below. All work contemplated below would be subject to all existing OPM-NBIB background investigation policy and any modifications executed thereto during performance. Responses received hereto are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Nothing submitted in response to this RFI will be shared outside of the interested parties currently planning for future requirements. Specifically, no contractor submitted information shall be shared with other contractors or those without a direct need to know in performance of their Government planning responsibilities. <br /><br />One of the Government's planning objectives is to seek contract alternatives for fieldwork services without negatively impacting its current capacity. Specifically, it seeks to write contracts that do not primarily involve those individuals actively performing fieldwork services for OPM. The work would likely require at least one (1) project manager, a staff of qualified background investigators and all other costs attributable to the management and successful delivery of the work. Exclusionary language prohibiting the recruitment and use of said individuals may or may not be included in future solicitations. Assuming that the geographic location of the work is limited to "inside the Beltway" are restrictions such as these insurmountable barriers to entry? If not then how would your firm perform a contract for fieldwork services without actively recruiting and proposing individuals that currently provide fieldwork services for OPM? Could it do so while also maintaining OPM's industry leading performance standards for both quality and timeliness? What impact, if any, would these restrictions have on your firm's pricing strategy and/or ability to begin performance of work upon receipt of an award?<br /><br />A second Government planning objective is to consider contract alternatives for fieldwork services which include the use of adjustable fixed price contracts and options for increased quantity. Specifically, it seeks to write contracts which include an initial period of performance (assume six (6) months) and an estimated quantity (assume seven hundred and fifty (750) per month or four thousand, five hundred (4,500) per individual period of performance) of elements of a given background investigation (such as subject reference, employment, residential and education interviews) which require fieldwork services. The estimated quantities would be adjustable, under stated circumstances, without a corresponding impact to per unit cost within a stated variance of +/- 20%. The Government would only pay for successfully completed elements that pass its quality review process. The contract would include unilateral Government options for additional quantities of specific line items (similar conditions as above and executed in accordance with applicable FAR clause(s)) that could increase the quantities of work and extend the contract's duration. The total estimated quantity of work could be up to twenty-two thousand, five hundred (22,500) and the entire period of performance could be up to two (2) years if all options were exercised and all estimated quantities were necessary during performance. Does your firm have experience providing fieldwork services under a contract type similar to the above? If so then please enumerate. In either scenario (experience with the above or none) does your firm perceive significant benefits or disadvantages in the proposed contract type? What challenges, if any, would you identify as risks to successful delivery considering the above? What improvements or modifications, if any, could be made to the above that would result in a more attractive contract structure to industry? What impact, if any, would the proposed contract type have on your firm's pricing strategy, interest level in developing a competitive proposal and/or ability to perform in an efficient and effective manner? If readily available what is your firm's estimated, fully loaded man-hour rate to perform in accordance with the above?<br /><br />A third Government planning objective is to consider contract alternatives for fieldwork services which involve performance by small business concerns. OPM is committed to its stated small business goals and is interested in continuing to develop its understanding of the small business industry's capacity and interest in delivering the above. To that end OPM actively encourages small business participation in its acquisitions. Responses to this RFI are not limited to small business concerns but if your firm is in fact an interested small business then please identify as such and include a summary of your capabilities and experience related to the above. If interested in the above would your firm likely be more successful as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor to a large business with considerable experience delivering the same or similar work? Does your small business firm have all of the necessary experience, capacity and corporate resources to successfully perform on the above while maintaining OPM's industry leading performance standards? <br /><br />In an attempt to minimize administrative burden the Government requests that your response to the above be limited to five (5) pages. Corporate background information and portfolios of successful efforts providing fieldwork services are excluded from said limit. You may exceed the limit at your discretion in the event that additional pages are felt necessary to respond. In the event that you choose to respond to this RFI please do so by submitting, via email, to the point of contact identified below by the due date of 01/17/2017 at 12:00pm Noon EST. At this point in its planning process the Government intends to limit its exchanges with industry to electronic communication. In the event that your firm seeks an audience with Government personnel, whether via a teleconference or in-person, please indicate as much in your response and we will do our very best to accommodate reasonable requests. The Government appreciates your consideration of the above and looks forward to receipt of timely provided response(s).<br /><br />Point of Contact:

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		3920-00-NIB-0001<br />Name:		Hand Truck, 46.5" H x 21" W, 8" Solid Puncture-Proof Tires<br />Description:	Steel tubing hand truck with 8" solid puncture-proof tires. 600 lb. load capacity.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			3920-00-NIB-0001<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	47109; 4092; 210349</p>
<p>NSN:			3920-00-NIB-0002<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	4095; 4084R; *H-4794</p>
<p>NSN:			3920-00-NIB-0003<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	4061; *30151</p>
<p>NSN:			3920-00-NIB-0004<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	210026; 210034; A11E-B1-C6-D5-E1EB-E46E-E47E-BDC</p>
<p>NSN:			3920-00-NIB-0005<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	YY-600-2; 4050; 4086R</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than January 18, 2017 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.

<RESPDATE>020117
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email kemper.wood@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one (1) year with four (4) option years, sole source, fixed price contract with Hamilton Robotics, Inc., 4970 Energy Way Reno, Nevada for the purpose of procuring a preventative maintenance and service contract for its existing Hamilton Robotics Workstations.
<p>The Nuclear DNA Unit (nDNAU) has two (2) existing Hamilton Robotic Workstation Systems, which is a high-capacity, high-throughput system designed to extract 96 samples at a time, as well as perform quantification and amplification set-up using commercially available chemical methods. The Hamilton Robotic System is the only automated instrument that can be programmed for multiple extraction chemistries at the same time. The Hamilton Robotic System is also the only automated instrument that can be used for all three steps of the DNA Casework Unit (DCU) process on the same platform: extraction, quantification set-up, and amplification set-up. An added benefit of the Hamilton Robotic System/software customization package is the ability to accommodate commercially available kits that should become available in the future as well as the ability to adapt to evolving needs of the DCU. In order to have these instruments in service for casework, regular maintenance and timely service repairs are not only necessary to obtain reliable results but also required by accrediting forensic organizations. The maintenance requirements are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; Priority dispatch <br />&bull; A target response time of 24 hours and guaranteed response time of 48 hours for a down instrument<br />&bull; A guaranteed call back time of 4 hours<br />&bull; Two (2) Preventative Maintenance's per year.<br />&bull; Includes all parts, travel and labor.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Hamilton Robotics, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the FBI owned Hamilton Robotics workstations and customized software; therefore, they are the only authorized manufacturer to provide maintenance and repair of these instruments. Any attempt by any other vendor to perform the maintenance and work on the workstations would void all warranties.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Wednesday, February 1, 2017 (8:00 am Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<p>5. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate white papers responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. White Papers will not be evaluated against each other.</p>
<p>The primary evaluation criteria are:</p>
<p>a) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which the proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered.</p>
<p>b) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.<br /><br />6. AWARDS</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to award Cooperative Agreements and/or contracts and will consider various types of acquisition vehicles including but not limited to traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts or other non-procurement agreements. NAVAIR is planning to make one or more awards within the overall objectives stated in this BAA. All awards will be based on the individual merit of the proposal. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a cooperative agreement and/or contract. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business programs. These efforts shall be conducted primarily at the offeror's site but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.</p>
<p>NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Modifications to the agreement and/or contract may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting agreement, and therefore will have met the requirements of the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DODGARS) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented.</p>

With exception of the Aircraft OEM, a capable vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Service Facility, and/or an OEM approved distributor facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the commercial buy, and be able to certify the accessories and parts are for the HC-144 (CN-235). Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV . If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item managers and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Mr. Peter Murray 252-335-6404 for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, Past Performance and Price.</p>
<p>The Technical element of the evaluation will first be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation.

<p>The Technical element of the evaluation shall be based solely on information furnished by the vendor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets or exceeds the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement. If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to conform to the requirement of this solicitation, the offeror shall include a clear description of such proposed modifications and clearly mark any descriptive materials to show modifications.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed product to industry or Government agencies. Past performance will consider the ability of the offeror to meet technical specifications, delivery schedules (with warranty fulfillment and maintenance reputation included as applicable). Offerors shall include two (2) records of sales from the previous 12 months. Offerors shall identify a point of contact for each sale by providing a name and telephone number.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated based on the total proposed price, including options, (if any).</p>

<p>6.4.1 The contract closeout process includes activities such as processing de-obligation modifications, obtaining contractor and requiring activity concurrence, preparing the DD-Form 1594 (Contract Completion Statement), and preparing closed files for archiving. Support contractors may perform additional administrative duties, including filing and processing simple administrative modifications. Performing these functions require the contractor employees to have access to the contract file. Therefore, information you provide to the Government or information already in the possession of the Government may be viewed by these support contractors in the course of performing contract close-out functions. The information that may be made available to the contractor may include pricing and technical proposals and performance information. The agency has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements with each support contractor employee and has required the contractor to provide a Conflict of interest Mitigation Plan to ensure these employees are firewalled from all business development activity. By acknowledging receipt and acceptance of this award, the offeror and its subcontractors consent to access of their business sensitive/confidential or proprietary data by the Government's support contractor personnel in order to perform close out services.</p>
<p>7.0 Period of Performance<br />The base contract period for this purchase order will be from: 01 February 2017 - 30 September 2017; with a unilateral one-year option period that may be exercised by NMCSD.</p>

<p>NASA/George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) intends to enter into one or more General Construction Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) under which the Government may award individual orders with a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) not to exceed $25,000. Historical data indicates the average FFP per order under the existing General Construction BPAs is approximately $7,900.

Specific work requirements will be included in the individual orders.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for the BPAs is five years. MSFC reserves the right to award as many or as few BPAs as it deems is in the best interest of the Government. Payment for orders will be made by Government Credit Card. Authorized Government credit cardholders may solicit oral or written price quotes for proposed orders from BPA holders and orders may be awarded to the BPA holder whose quote is deemed to be the most advantageous to the Government. Oral or written quotes may be solicited from BPA holders utilizing competitive or noncompetitive procurement procedures. There is no guarantee that an order will be placed under any BPA. The Government may solicit quotes from and place orders with firms who are not a BPA holder since the Government is not required to utilize any BPA to satisfy its general construction requirements. In order to be considered for award, firms must have an established credit card account, comply with MSFC Credit Card Program procedures, have a valid Duns Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on January 13, 2017. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Casey McLean. The fax number is 303- 497-3163 and email address is casey.mclean@noaa.gov</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought (Office Space)
<p>The Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA, is seeking to lease approximately 601 rentable square feet of fully serviced office space in Alliance, N.C. Space offered must be within the attached delineated area, and must meet all state and local building regulations and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). New or existing space with renovations will be considered. Space must be available for occupancy on or before 07/01/2017. All services, supplies, utilities, and janitorial (full service lease) are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The lease term is 15 years. The lease will include a 120-day termination clause.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Persons interested in offering space meeting these requirements and wishing to obtain a solicitation packet should contact on or before 2/10/2017, by 5 p.m.:</p>

Supporting Government of South Africa&rsquo;s (GoSA) HIV and TB comprehensive care and treatment services is a priority of the USG and USAID mission in South Africa. The program has successfully met ambitious goals to support the initiation of individuals on antiretroviral treatment, and has provided technical assistance for health systems strengthening to the Government of South Africa.

<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work</span></strong></p>
<p>U.S. Waterborne Foreign Transportation Data<br />1) Purpose. To provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) with comprehensive monthly U.S. foreign transportation data similar to manifest data collected by U.S. Customs Border and Protection (Customs) or the Bills of Lading filed by the ship lines to Customs for all U.S. imports, exports and in-transit waterborne commerce to and from foreign countries.</p>
<p>2) Background. On September 28, 1998 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) as the "central collection agency" for the U.S. Foreign Waterborne Transportation Statistics Program (FWTSP) effective October 1, 1998. The U.S. Bureau of the Census (Census) was previously responsible for this program. This decision followed a review of the U.S. Foreign Waterborne Transportation Statistics program at the direction of OMB. The Corps collects and publishes the data pursuant to its authority under the 1922 River and Harbor Act (33 U.S.C. 555) by which it has historically collected and published waterborne commerce statistics.</p>
<p>The FWTSP requires manifest data that provides the associated cargo and vessel movement transaction data upfront, unlike trade data. In-transit records are included in the manifest dataset, which are movements of foreign cargo through the U.S. from one foreign country to another foreign country. Inbound waterborne in-transits enter the U.S. via marine vessel and outbound waterborne in-transits exit the U.S. via marine vessel.<br />3) Tasks: The data provided to WCSC shall include information where available on the date and trade direction; carrier and shipment details; cargo, weight and container details; product descriptions and codes; geographic indicators; shippers, consignees and notify parties; and processing information. The minimum data elements to be included in the database are provided below. The coded data items shall be compatible with the data furnished by Customs. The reported commodity description shall be coded to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule commodity codes. The data shall be sent in electronic format. Updated information to previously delivered data shall be provided upon request.</p>
<p>4) Considerations. Purchase of these data by the USACE constitutes purchase by a government agency. As such, the data may be used internally by any USACE office without violating any copyright restrictions.</p>
<p>5) Deliverables and Schedule. The data are to be delivered via FTP monthly, not later than six weeks after the close of the month. The data files shall be provided by month and direction with record structure(s) included. Inbound/outbound in-transit records shall be included within the import/export files. Any records that were added for a month after initial month delivered, should be included the first month they are available. A 13th month containing all records not previously sent should be made (if necessary) after the close of a calendar year. WCSC shall be provided field definitions and notified of any changes to the record layout or imputed data (data derived from other fields). Import and export fields should have the same field name, field type, field size, and field definitions except for those fields that are only applicable for either imports or exports. A portal to the live data should be made available so that WCSC can see updates to previously delivered records and confirm that all records have been delivered.</p>
<p>6) Performance Objectives (required results)<br />a. Completeness in providing data, where available, for all U.S. imports, exports and in-transit waterborne commerce, with the exception of the Virgin Islands and Louisiana Offshore Oil Platform data. Less than 5% of the final weight generated by WCSC should be added from other sources.<br />b. Level of accuracy required on commodity coding; cargo weight; geographic locations, both U.S. and foreign with no more than 5% of the records requiring corrections. Also should provide at least a 95% match rate against vessel movements reported by Customs. <br />c. Timeliness in providing monthly data within six weeks after the close of the month<br />d. Consistency in record layouts and data types for the calendar year</p>
<p><br />7) Communication Plan. <br />a) Regularly scheduled monthly meetings between WCSC and provider's technical staff responsible for addressing discovered data questions, methodologies, errors and concerns. <br />b) Any data errors requiring a mass update to provider's database shall be communicated immediately when impacts to the delivery contents (including previously delivered data) and/or schedule are found.<br />Data Elements and Descriptions</p>

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as RFQ NNK17599306Q for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for appraisal services to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94. This requirement is a total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 531320, Offices of Real Estate Appraisers, with a size standard of $7.5 million.
<p>The Contractor shall appraise properties described in individual call orders (e.g. .parcels of vacant land, buildable land, easements, facilities, etc.). The Contractor shall make a detailed field inspection and identification of the various items of the property and shall make such investigations and studies as are appropriate and necessary to enable the Contractor to derive sound conclusions and to prepare the appraisal reports to be furnished under this contract. Upon completion of the inspections, investigations, and studies, the Contractor shall prepare, furnish, and deliver to the Government an appraisal reports in four copies covering said property.</p>
<p>The report shall, in form and substance, conform to the requirements for a complete, self-contained appraisal report as set forth by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP); shall present adequate factual data to support each rate, percentage, or amount used in sufficient detail to permit an intelligent review of the appraisal report; shall relate conclusions to those facts; and shall, among other things, include the items set forth in Special Requirements and individual task orders. A professional, independent appraiser will review prior to acceptance.</p>
<p>2. The period of performance shall consist of a 2-year base, 2-year option 1, and 1-year option 2. NASA estimates that ten (10) call orders will be issued each year. Appraisals under this BPA will vary in price and complexity, although the attached Statement of Work (SOW) (Attachment 1) is representative of potential appraisals to be completed under this BPA. For evaluation purposes, Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the appraisal as stated in Attachment 1. NASA will utilize the proposed price and government estimated quantity of call orders per year to establish the maximum value of the BPA. Future call orders under the BPA will be issued based on quotes received in response to the specific appraisal requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, Offerors shall provide a descriptive narrative and/or evidence of:</p>
<p>- A minimum of 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, to include proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- Experience demonstrating the appraisal of large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience demonstrating the appraisal of NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) specifically. Demonstrate knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Factors and Basis for Award Determination</p>
<p>a. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation process. After receipt of proposals, the Government will first evaluate the lowest price proposal. If the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and otherwise properly awardable, no further evaluations will be conducted, and award will be made. If, however, the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable and/or otherwise not properly awardable, evaluations of the next lowest proposal will be evaluated as stated above.</p>
<p>b. The Offerors descriptive narrative will be evaluated to determine technical acceptability. Failure to address and provide evidence of the above elements of technical acceptability may result in the Government determining the proposal as non-responsive. Offerors that meet the following minimum qualifications will be determined technically acceptable:</p>
<p>- The Offeror shall have 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, maintain proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- The Offeror shall demonstrate experience appraising large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience appraising NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and CCAFS specifically. Knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p><br />c. NASA will evaluate the Offerors price quote for the attached SOW to determine the lowest priced Offeror. The quote shall be inclusive of all associated cost elements, to include travel, materials, and other direct cost (ODC). NASA will use the price quote for this sample task to determine the Offeror's total evaluated price. The sample task is provided for price evaluation purposes and issuance of the first call order. NASA will obligate funding for this sample task after award of the BPA.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a BPA without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek clarifications if the Contracting Officer (CO) determines they are necessary. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed task cannot be resolved to the CO's satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the proposed BPA. In such an event, offerors will be notified in writing.</p>
<p>5. Applicable Provisions and Clauses are in Attachment 3.</p>
<p>6. Questions should be addressed to daniel.j.heggen@nasa.gov. Telephone questions will not be accepted. Please provide any questions, in writing, no later than January 9, 2017 at 11:00 AM (ET). The Government reserves the right to not answer questions submitted after this time. Reference number NNK17599306Q should be included in the subject line.</p>
<p>7. Proposals are due no later than January 16, 2017 at 11:00 AM (ET) and should be submitted to the NASA Contract Specialist via the following email address: daniel.j.heggen@nasa.gov.

<DESC>SOLICITATION PHASE I.<br />The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a contractor to perform Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services at the Weis Federal Courthouse in Pittsburgh, PA.  The work includes but is not limited to constructing the necessary shell and tenant improvements (TI) required for two new occupant agencies, namely the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  In addition, the contractor will be required to construct the necessary shell and TI for the forced relocation of approximately three existing tenant spaces.  Design will be based upon conceptual plans developed by MGA Partners Architects during a previously completed study.<br /> <br />This procurement will be advertised on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov), and all interested offerors will be able to respond to the Request for Proposal (RFP) on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 million dollars.<br /> <br />Award will be a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price with Construction Contingency Allowance and Shared Savings contract.  The CMc contract is a variation on the fixed price incentive (successive targets) contract type found in FAR 16.403-2 tailored for construction.  The ceiling price is set at selection and award of the contract.  The adjusting profit requirement in FAR 16.403-2 is accomplished through the shared savings aspect of the contract.  And the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated RFP.  The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value tradeoff concept as identified in FAR Part 15.101-1 and FAR Part 15.3.  It is the Government's intention to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements and is considered to be most advantageous to the government, price, and technical factors considered.  Competitive proposals shall be evaluated and assessed based on the factors specified in this solicitation.  For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is significantly more important than price.
<p><br />This procurement will be advertised on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website, and will be completed in two phases.  The first phase includes technical evaluation only, and all interested firms will be able to respond to the RFP.  The technical factors for the first phase include:  Prior Experience, Past Performance on Relevant Projects, and Project Team Qualifications.  This phase will result in the development of an advisory short list. The Government will respond to the technical submissions with information on the likelihood that the offeror will be considered technically qualified.</p>
<p>The second phase will include a full technical evaluation (Project Management/Delivery Plan), a Base Bid proposal for the Demolition and Forced Relocation package, and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Option for the construction work based on a 35% design.  The GMP option price will be finalized at or after the 75% design milestone.  The option may also be exercised at this time.<br /> <br />The Solicitation (RFP) will only be available electronically. The solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) can only be obtained through FedBizOpps. FedBizOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition material. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material.</p>
<p>PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.</p>

<p>1.0 CONTRACT INFORMATION</p>
<p>General. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (also known as the Brooks Act) as implemented per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub Part 36.6, Sub Part 236.6 of the Defense Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) and Sub Part 5136.6 of the Army Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS); the USACE Acquisition Instructions (UAI); and Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE. These IDCs are intended to be solicited, evaluated and awarded applying the requirements and procedures identified in the 40 United States Code (U.S.C) Chapter 11, Public Law 92-582, Selection of Architects and Engineers, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 36.6, 10 U.S. Code 2855, Law Applicable to Contracts for Architectural and Engineering Services and Construction Design, Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Architect Engineer Contracting in USACE, DFARS 219.502-1(2), and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one A-E synopsis will be issued for this requirement. In accordance with FAR 19.502-3, the Contracting Officer plans to set-aside a minimum of three IDCs for small businesses. A target of six A-E IDCs, with a shared capacity of $100M, is contemplated for award; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or no contract at all. This strategy is intended to satisfy the requirements of DFARS 219.502-1(2) and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii). The resultant contracts will have a 24-month base ordering period and three 12- month optional ordering periods.</p>
<p>The evaluation board will conduct initial evaluations of qualifications for two separate groups: large businesses and small businesses.<br />All firms will be evaluated against the same primary and secondary selection criteria; however, the Small Business Firms will be ranked separately from the Large Business Firms. All members of the selection board must personally evaluate the SF 330's of all of the highly qualified firms. The firms that demonstrate higher aggregate qualifications relevant to the primary selection criteria are considered to be the most highly qualified firms within each group. Sufficient firms must be recommended to ensure that at least two most highly qualified firms within each group remain "in reserve" when negotiations commence on the final contracts. If two or more firms are technically equal, the secondary criteria will be used as "tie-breakers" and the final ranking of firms will be decided after interviews are conducted. After the initial evaluation of qualifications has taken place to determine the most highly qualified firms for each group, a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the highest rated firms in each group. Negotiations, as necessary, will take place and if negotiations are not successful with any of the highest rated firms, negotiations will be conducted with the next most highly qualified firm(s), and so on.<br />Task orders will be awarded detailing technical requirements, deliverables, and schedules. The A-E contractor(s) shall, upon task order award, perform services to meet the requirements of the order as well as comply with all applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Federal, State and Local laws, regulations, agreements, Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) and Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) and policies.</p>
<p>IAW the Service Contract Labor Standards (previously known as the Service Contract Act of 1965) as defined in the FAR 37.101, this will be a service acquisition.

In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Firm and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction/design-build contracts that relate to any A-E TOs awarded under this contract.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Condition Found Report, Change Orders will be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how these documents are to be followed for the duration of the contract performance period:</p>
<p>(a) Condition Found Report (CFR) - All readings and inspections are to be taken within 24 hours after the machinery or system is opened. All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Change Request- CR and IGE are generated by the COR and entered in the Contract Workbook. COR will assign the Change request number.<br />4. COR provides copy of Change Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on CR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager.

Similar to many other services the Army procures, the selected Agency will provide professional expertise and services. However, unlike any other service the Army procures, the selected Agency is required to develop and execute successful national and local marketing communication efforts in support of the development of a vibrant marketing and advertising strategy and subsequent marketing plans required to transform the mindset of the target audiences. The strategies and marketing plans encompass the enlisted and officer manpower requirement of the Active Army, Army Reserve, Army Civilian workforce, and the Army National Guard. In addition, campaigns may be required for influencer and multi-cultural markets.<br /><br />1.3 The Agency is also required to provide a full range of services to include, assisting the development of the Army's marketing strategy, the execution of the tactical advertising strategy through the production of a wide range of advertising solutions.<br />1.4 This is a performance based requirement that not only provides the above described services but also complete advertising planning and tactical services.

Any previously submitted responses to this step will not be reviewed.<br /><br />2.2 The 412th CSB will advise Agencies responding to the Advisory Phase Questionnaire if they are considered viable competitors or if they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. If a company is advised that they will not be a viable competitor, they are NOT precluded from submitting a proposal once the actual solicitation is issued.<br /><br />2.3 Limit responses to only what is requested in the Advisory Phase Questionnaire. Additional information provided outside of the questionnaire will not be reviewed and will not be considered in determining the viability of a potential offeror. Completed and submitted questionnaires are considered "Source Selection Sensitive" and shall be protected in accordance with FAR 3.104-4.<br /><br />2.4 This phase is NOT to be construed as the Request for Proposal. The Government WILL NOT reimburse proposal costs stemming from this phase. This is merely an opportunity, given the significant financial investment required to participate in this acquisition, for the Government to advise interested Agencies of their potential to be a viable competitor in this acquisition. It is NOT to be construed as a formal evaluation in response to a Request for Proposal.<br /><br />2.5 The Contracting Office WILL NOT entertain questions at this phase. There will be a question phase allotted for, if necessary, upon release of the solicitation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) system for processing Medicare claims from institutional providers (e.g., hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc.).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medical Claims System (MCS) for processing Medicare claims from practitioners and suppliers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Common Working File system, for additional processing and authorization of all claim types.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Common Edit Module (CEM), which the A/B MAC will integrate into its electronic claims receipt capability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Provider Enrollment Chain and Ownership System (PECOS) for processing Medicare provider enrollment applications, which also interfaces to numerous other systems in order to deliver its functionality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) to post and maintain Medicare accounts payable and receivable, and to support other fiscal and accounting functions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The System for Tracking Audit and Reimbursement (STAR) system, to manage and control Medicare provider audit and reimbursement workload.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medicare Appeals System (MAS), to manage and control its claims appeals workload.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Integrated Data Repository, to support the A/B MAC's data analytics responsibilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor Reporting of Operational and Workload Data (CROWD) system, for reporting of A/B MAC claims and other workload data, and other CMS reporting systems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CMS may create additional IT systems in the future to support the ongoing development of the Medicare FFS program, and the A/B MAC contractor may be required to develop processes and/or interfaces with such additional CMS systems to perform its duties (historically, these scenarios are one of many causes for SOW revisions&nbsp; post-award).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to serving as a user of numerous CMS systems, the A/B MAC contractor will itself provide additional IT systems and capabilities, particularly systems and capabilities to support its Medicare provider customer service program responsibilities, that will process and store PHI and PII.&nbsp; Generally, existing software will be modified or enhanced. These contractor-provided IT systems and capabilities (for instance, Medicare provider portals) must conform with CMS IT architecture and security requirements, and receive CMS approval before being put into production.&nbsp; Any Medicare data housed in contractor-furnished systems remain CMS program data. All MAC-provided IT is required to be compliant with Section 508.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Due to their enormous responsibilities as custodians of Medicare data, Medicare law (at Section 1874A(e) of the Act) specifically applies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and related government-wide systems security requirements to the MACs.&nbsp; The Department and CMS have also applied many additional information security and critical infrastructure directives to the MACs, including Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 12 (HSPD-12).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses capable of performing design-bid-build (DBB) construction services for project RM 7-01, Building 1029, at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center, NAVSUPPACT Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania (DET Philadelphia Navy Yard (PNY) Annex, Philadelphia, PA.

The purpose of this project is to repair the existing electrical system in Building 1029 at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC), to provide a safe, environmentally controlled work area.
  Building 1029 is a 90,180 SF high bay industrial facility that was constructed in 1979.  It is the inside machine shop for the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center and is responsible for the milling of all sizes of propellers for surface ships and submarines.  Building 1029 equipment includes propeller profilers, PROMS (Propeller Robotic Optical Milling System), and various others milling machines, lathes, saws and grinders in support of the propeller manufacturing operations.  These large profilers can mill propellers up to 24 feet in diameter and require a controlled environment to maintain milling tolerances.  

This project will repair the existing HVAC system and the installation of Air Conditioning in the High Bay of Building 1029.
  These repairs, replacements and equipment additions will improve the workplace environment inside the machine shop of Building 1029 at the NFPC with improved heating and ventilation to support ship and submarine propeller manufacturing and shall meet the operational requirements of manufacturing propellers within the specified temperature range to maintain its critical tolerance level for the future profilers to be located in the central bays of Building 1029.  

This Project will also replace the low voltage 480V aluminum cables with copper wiring between the substation and various power panels.  In addition, all aluminum conductors from distribution panel boards to subpanels and associated transformers will be removed and replaced with copper conductors.
  New circuits will also be provided for the new equipment, and smoke detectors, with required fire alarm system interfacing in compliance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.  

Lastly, this project scope will also include the removal of abandoned steam lines and asbestos-containing and other hazardous materials.

The work on this project must be performed in such a manner to prevent the equipment and operations housed within Building 1029 to not be visible when the replacement work is performed.  The Contractor must coordinate with the Naval Foundry  and  Propeller Center to establish a construction phasing and sequence of construction which will meet the user requirements for continued operation and result in the least amount of disruption to the propeller shop operations and in a manner which would allow the Contractor to complete the work to achieve these requirements.
  Due to the layout of the equipment within the building and continued operation of the existing cranes within the building, construction of scaffolding or work platforms within the building is not feasible.  

The building must remain operational during all work of this project due to the nature of the propeller shop activities, work schedule which must be maintained and 24/7 shift work hours.  Equipment will be allowed to be taken off-line for scheduled time frames as the work schedule/flow allows providing areas to allow overhead work to be performed.  This will result in work phasing requirements.  

A work phasing sequence plan shall be established in coordination with the user.  The Contractor will be required to follow this sequence of work indicated.
  The user, through the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), will be allowed to alter the sequence and direct the Contractor to work in a different area, based on scheduled equipment use.  

All use of Contractor supplied and utilized cranes, lifts, and booms must be coordinated with the COR, NAVFAC MIDLANT, and the Navy Crane center thru the COR.  Any use of cranes, lifts or booms within the building must be transparent to the operation of the building user operations.  The Contractor will not be allowed to utilize the existing bridge cranes within the building.

Building 1029 is a restricted entry building located at the Navy Yard, Philadelphia, PA.  Contractors must employ United States citizens and the Contractor must obtain CONFIDENTIAL Clearance for all personnel working in Building 1029.
  The company must first obtain clearance, and then all employees must obtain CONFIDENTIAL Clearance.

Contract Clause FAR 52.204-2, Security Requirements and Alternate II, FAC 5252.236-9301, Special Working Conditions and Entry to Work Area, applies.

Contractor personnel and other personnel associated with the Contractor in performing the work specified under this contract work must comply with the security requirements and classification of this procurement as indicated in Form DD 254.

The appropriate Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 238210  Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors, and the Small Business Size Standard is $15,000,000.
  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The contract will include FAR clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting, which states that The concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services by May 2017. 

It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the Contracting Officer a capabilities package, to include the Sources Sought Contractor Information Form, Sources Sought Project Information Form and Sources Sought Project Matrix, provided as attachments to this notice.

<p>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: <br />This Synopsis/Pre-Solicitation Notice is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming. All questions regarding this Synopsis/Pre-Solicitation should be submitted in writing via email to Ms. Paano at the email indicated above.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Sources Sought Announcement for this requirement was previously advertised under number W68MD960336658.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: FY16 Libby Dam Emergency Lighting Summary of Work:<br />The Libby Dam Emergency Lighting project will provide upgrades to the emergency lighting and fire safety. Emergency lighting upgrades include additional lighting to emergency egress routes, placement of LED exit signs along egress routes, and conversion from use of the existing battery system to a self-contained UL 924 listed UPS. The existing emergency lighting system is 125 VDC to power incandescent lighting when switched to emergency mode. Normal power is 120 VAC. With incandescent lighting slowing being phased out, it was recommended to no longer rely on 125 VDC for the emergency lighting system.</p>
<p>Fire safety upgrades include updates to the egress path (including pressurization system for existing elevator, and new ladder installation), and replacement/decommissioning of existing fire alarm with new fire alarm. The existing notification and initiating circuits will be rerouted from the existing fire alarm control panel (FACP) to the new FACP. The new FACP shall maintain existing fire alarm notification and initiating circuits and add in the rest of the powerhouse into a centralized FACP. The FACP shall utilize class B circuits for both notification and initiating circuits. The fire alarm will utilize 8 Notification Amplifier Power Extender Panels (NAPEPs) to step up the voltage of the notification circuits due to the voltage drop concerns from the long distances the circuits travel in the powerhouse.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>Solicitation number W912DW-17-B-0001 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov, on or about 9 November 2016. The solicitation will be an Invitation for Bids. Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date. See the solicitation for details about proposal submission. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236210, Industrial Building Construction, and the associated small business size standard is $36,500,000 in average annual receipts.

<DESC>On December 30, 2016, the U.S. Coast Guard exercised a Fixed Price Incentive - Firm Target optional Contract Line Item Number (CLIN)&nbsp;for the ninth National Security Cutter (NSC)&nbsp;on a sole source basis with Huntington Ingalls Incorporated (HII) under contract HSCG23-16-C-ADB016, commencing the Production and Delivery (P&amp;D) effort. This ninth ship is to be the same dimensions, configuration and operational capability as the first eight (8) NSCs and is to be delivered before the end of FY2020. The sole source award to HII, 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39567, NAICS Code: 336611 - Naval Shipbuilding; Standard Industrial Classification Code: 3731 - Ship Building and Repairing, is under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(2)(iii)(A) and (B), based on the substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Award to any other source would result in an unacceptable negative operational impact to the USCG.
<p>HSCG23-16-C-ADB016<br />Huntington Ingalls Incorporated<br />1000 Access Road<br />Pascagoula, MS 39567<br />Obligation Amount: $485,994,887.00<br />Current Contract Total Value: $574,190,569.00<br />Maximum Potential Contract Value: $580,190,569.00</p>

<DESC>UNITED STATES GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION REGION I<br />Public Building Service, Acquisition Division (1PQB)<br />Justification and Approval (J&amp;A)<br />For Other Than Full and Open Competition
<p>1.	Contracting Activity:<br />GSA Region 1, Public Building Service (PBS), Acquisition Management Division - 1PQB</p>
<p>2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:<br />This procurement is for Operation &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Janitorial services in accordance with FAR 13.106&#8208; 1(b) and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303&#8208;2.</p>
<p>3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:<br />The contractor is to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, material, supplies and equipment (except otherwise provided) and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services necessary to perform full O&amp;M and janitorial services from February 1, 2017 through May 31, 2017, with a six (6) month option for the John O. Pastore Federal Office Building and U.S. Courthouse in Providence, RI.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: February 1, 2017 through May 31, 2017 with an option for an additional 6 months at current prices for operations and maintenance, janitorial, snow removal, landscaping, and fire protection and life safety services. The total Potential value, inclusive of any unexercised options, is $635,633.84.</p>
<p>4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:<br />This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.501- Commercial Item Test Program. FAR 13.501(a)(1) requires a written justification supporting the use of FAR 6.302&#8208;1, these services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow&#8208;on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-<br />(A)	Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):<br />In accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.106&#8208;1(b), and further utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13.5, it is determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem  only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>RTW, Inc. currently provides the O&amp;M, janitorial, and other services under contract, GS-01P-12-BW-D-0020.  This contract was awarded in July 2012 as a nine (9) year contract with a three (3) year base, and two (2) three (3) year options ending March 31, 2021. The contract was subsequently broken down into one (1) year options. For planning purposes associated with aligning multiple contracts for consolidation, GSA elected to exercise the contract's six (6) month extension rather than exercising the next full option year. The completion date under this contract is currently January 31, 2017 with no contract options remaining. This purchase order would align GSA's multiple contracts by extending services while the solicitation is being prepared.</p>
<p>As the incumbent, RTW Inc. possesses specialized knowledge in the services at the John O. Pastore Federal Office Building and U.S. Courthouse located in Providence, RI. RTW Inc. will be able to provide the required services without interruption as GSA continues efforts to competitively solicit a new consolidated service contract at five federal office buildings in the southeastern Massachusetts and Providence, RI area. The John O. Pastore Federal Office Building and U.S. Courthouse will be part of this new aggregated requirement.</p>
<p>A break or delay in service would result in the facility not being covered against required maintenance, damage, or failure of systems. This would be detrimental to the government in the form of lost productivity, closure of public services, increased cost for emergency services, and possible personal injury to building employees and civilians. Use of a contractor other than the incumbent could result in risk of significantly poor contract performance due to the absence of a learning curve period. This risk would be to the government and its employees as well as the contractor in terms of injury to personnel and equipment as well as increased cost risks.</p>
<p>Use of the incumbent contractor is both prudent and cost effective. A bridge contract provides the GSA with time to get the most equitable pricing for the government under a new contract during a time of cost reductions. Failure to allow enough time could lead to higher prices paid by the government.  Furthermore, a bridge contract does not require a transition and retraining period as it would with a new contractor. The incumbent has all necessary clearances which provides additional cost savings and eliminates any delay in service. At this moment, due to delays with OPM, it is estimated that a clearance for personnel on new contractors can take up to (8) eight months.  As previously mentioned, any delay in services would be detrimental to the agencies in the building.</p>
<p>6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:<br />GSA is in the process of consolidating service contracts at five federal office buildings in southeastern Massachusetts and Providence, RI to achieve operational cost savings at the same level of service. This will also offer an opportunity for participation by small business as it is anticipated based on market research that the procurement will be set aside for small business.  While the planning and market research from those efforts have identified contractors capable of providing the O&amp;M and janitorial services, it has been determined that none could be awarded the contract, granted security clearances, and transitioned into the position in ample time to avoid a delay in services and result in a loss of service at each federal building.</p>
<p>From that determination, a four (4) month bridge contract is being awarded while the competitive solicitation is being finalized to reach as many potential sources as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:<br />The Contracting Officer will take the following steps to ensure that the anticipated cost to the Government will be considered fair and reasonable:<br />(1)	A detailed cost analysis will be performed comparing RTW's proposal with the current cost paid for services. RTW has agreed to continue services with no cost increase to the government.<br />(2)	Incumbent pricing was evaluated as part of the original competitive award. At time of award the pricing was determined fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:<br />Market research for the upcoming competitive solicitation for O&amp;M and janitorial services was used for this four (4) month bridge contract.<br />The market research is based on the determination that GSA could achieve increased cost savings and opportunity for small business participation by issuing a consolidated contract for five federal office buildings in the region. Market research included the posting of a Sources Sought Notice from July 5, 2016 to July 20, 2016 and conducting market research using the SBA Dynamic Search Tool.<br />Market research did identify possible contractors capable of performing the duties; however, none of those identified could be cleared and transitioned into the contract in time to avoid delays to current services ending on January 31, 2017. Based on the results of the market research it was determined that it is not practicable to compete this short -term contract for temporary services.</p>
<p>9.	Any other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:<br />N/A</p>
<p>10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed in Writing an Interest in the Acquisition:<br />(A)	Sources Sought Responses for the upcoming consolidated procurement:<br />&bull;	Wilson 5 Corporation<br />&bull;	Trademasters Inc.<br />&bull;	Rosemark Inc.<br />&bull;	Primestar Construction<br />&bull;	PM Services Company<br />&bull;	SDAC Facility Services LLC.<br />&bull;	CMS &amp; Maintenance, Inc.</p>
<p>11.	Statement of the actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:<br />This short term incumbent contractor extension of services is necessary to facilitate a<br /> consolidated competitive acquisition which is anticipated to be awarded by June 1, 2017. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to FBO.gov and distributed to regional Procurement Technical Assistance Centers to reach the maximum number of capable vendors. This pending solicitation is for a new contract consolidating the total government requirement with 3 other facilities requiring similar services. This will open the competition to the vendors presented by the market research. By making it available on</p>
<p>FBO, this action is broadening competition, not restricting it. Therefore, the temporary bridge contract is put in place to allow for the competitive process to happen.  Efforts procuring new consolidated contract will occur during the period of performance of this short term bridge contract</p>
<p><br />12.	CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he has determined this document both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p>
