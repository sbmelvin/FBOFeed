<DESC><p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>AFRL/RXQ conducts research on materials and technology for force protection of assets including, but not limited to, expeditionary and permanent structures, vehicles, aircraft, and personnel. The ability to provide expedient protection for these assets is critical for improving and sustaining agile airbase capabilities. Assets that are mobile or those with very small footprints (several hundred ft2) are not afforded adequate protection as a permanent protective structure would be cost prohibitive and may become an obstruction to operations should the asset need to be relocated. Expedient protective systems provide a versatile, re-deployable solution that can accommodate a wide variety of assets and offer timely protection to assets critical to the mission at hand.</p>
<p>For many of these small assets, efforts are focused on providing protection from rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and mortars which often rely on shaped charges and small fragments to incur damage. Thus RPGs and mortars pose a severe threat to vulnerable assets which are important to the infrastructure and operations of an airbase. Protection can consist of sidewalls, roof and a pre-detonation layer. Structural sidewall protection is critical to provide protection from fragmentation, and it also supports the roof and potentially supports a pre-detonation layer. Use of a pre-detonation layer is one method employed to cause early detonation of the RPG/mortar threat before contact with the protection layer, thus reducing the effectiveness of the threat. To this end, RXQ seeks assistance in developing and testing technology options capable of providing expedient protection of this class of threat for these and similar assets.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>Desired Technology Capability Specifics</p>
<p>This request is for the identification of sources that can supply expedient protective systems that provide sidewall and overhead protection to include pre-detonation capabilities. For this effort, sidewall protection is defined as a material or combination of materials that can afford fragmentation protection to an asset as well as support the load of an overhead protection component and/or pre-detonation layer, if needed. Overhead protection must provide a similar protection level as the sidewall protection, but may work in conjunction with a pre-detonation layer.</p>
<p>AFRL/RXQ is interested in systems that have the capability to effectively and efficiently provide protection from fragmenting munitions and small shaped charges (&lt; 4 inches penetration in rolled homogenous armor (RHA)). These systems must provide the aforementioned protection for assets with small footprints (&lt; 2000 ft2) and provide for expedient setup (erectable within 24 hours without the use of heavy machinery). Potential systems, components, and materials must be tested and proven to provide ballistic protection equivalent to a 3,000 ft/s V50 for a 2 grain right circular cylinder (RCC). Systems must also be proven to withstand wind speeds of at least 120 mph in accordance with UFC 3-310-01, 25 May 2005 including Change 2, on 5 December, 2007. It is desirable for systems or materials to also have been tested against shaped charge jets or similar threats. Systems sought are not limited to specific designs. For example, potential solutions may be retrofits that take advantage of mounting points on existing structural components on buildings or stand-alone units such as tents or supported walls to protect vehicles. Solutions for only one type of protection (e.g. sidewall, overhead, pre-detonation) will also be welcomed. System modularity is not required, but is highly desirable as it could be adapted to protect multiple assets.</p>
<p>3. SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Limitations - The Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C 2533a) will not apply to potential submissions in response to this special notice; however, it could apply for any potential future orders.

<p>This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and effective this day of ________ 2012 by ___________________________________ ("VENDOR") located at _____________________________________ and the Air Force Research Laboratory ("AFRL") located at 139 Barnes Drive Suite 2, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 and any AFRL Contractors involved in the support of the efforts as listed in this Request.</p>
<p>1. Confidential Information.<br />The VENDOR proposes to disclose certain parts of its confidential and proprietary information (the "Confidential Information") to AFRL. Confidential Information shall include materials, products, technology, and other information disclosed or submitted, orally, in writing, or by any other media, to AFRL by the Vendor. Confidential Information disclosed orally shall be identified as such within five (5) days of disclosure. Nothing herein shall require the Vendor or AFRL to disclose any of its information.</p>
<p>2. AFRL's Obligations.<br />AFRL agrees that the Confidential Information is to be considered confidential and proprietary to the Vendor and AFRL shall hold the same in confidence, shall not use the Confidential Information other than for the purposes of its business with the Vendor, and shall disclose it only to its officers, directors, or employees with a specific need to know. AFRL will not disclose, publish or otherwise reveal any of the Confidential Information received from the Vendor to any other party whatsoever except with the specific prior written authorization of the Vendor.</p>
<p>B. Confidential Information furnished in tangible form shall not be duplicated by AFRL except for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the request of the Vendor, AFRL shall return all Confidential Information received in written or tangible form from the VENDOR, including copies, or reproductions or other media containing such Confidential Information, within ten (10) days of such request. At AFRL's option, any documents or other media developed by the AFRL containing Confidential Information may be destroyed by AFRL.</p>
<p>C. AFRL is not a certification agency and testing of any the VENDOR products does not constitute a commitment on behalf of the Department of Defense or United States Air Force to procure any such items.</p>
<p>3. Term.<br />The obligations of AFRL herein shall be effective immediately from the date THE VENDOR last discloses any Confidential Information to AFRL pursuant to this Agreement. Further, the obligation not to disclose shall not affect the VENDOR from submitting products for testing but may limit AFRL's ability to adequately evaluate the submission(s). AFRL may request additional information to assist with assessing the ability of the products to meet the threshold or objective requirements. This agreement may be terminated by either party at any time within the period of its duration by means of written notice thereof. Upon the receipt of notice of termination, AFRL shall return all Confidential Information received from the VENDOR. AFRL shall be under no obligation to provide additional information or data collected from testing the VENDOR equipment upon termination or expiration of this agreement.</p>
<p>4. Other Information.<br />AFRL shall have no obligation under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information which is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement by AFRL; is rightfully received by AFRL without obligations of confidentiality; or is developed by AFRL without breach of this Agreement; provided, however, such Confidential Information shall not be disclosed until thirty (30) days after written notice of intent to disclose is given to THE VENDOR along with the asserted grounds for disclosure.</p>
<p>5. No License.<br />Nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information. The disclosure of Confidential Information shall not be construed as evidencing any intent by a party to purchase any products or services of the other party nor as an encouragement to expend funds in development or research efforts. Confidential Information may pertain to prospective or unannounced products. AFRL agrees not to use any Confidential Information as a basis upon which to develop or have a third party develop a competing or similar product.</p>
<p>6. No Publicity.<br />THE VENDOR agrees not to use the data or information provided from testing or evaluation of any of their products for advertising or endorsement by the Department of Defense, United States Air Force, or AFRL or its contractors. All data, digital pictures and video taken during this agreement are property of AFRL. AFRL may, at its discretion and after approval for public release, provide data, digital pictures and/or video to the VENDOR. Terms of use will be defined by AFRL if these items are provided to the VENDOR.</p>
<p>7. Governing Law and Equitable Relief.<br />Confidential Information qualifies for exemption and is and shall be exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") 5 USC &sect; 552, pursuant to 5 USC &sect; 552(b)(4), and constitutes "Confidential Commercial Information" within the meaning of Section 2 of Executive Order No. 12600, 52 F.R. 23781, June 23, 1987. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable to the Federal Government of the United States of America.</p>
<p>8. Final Agreement.<br />This Agreement terminates and supersedes all prior understandings or agreements on the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be modified only by a further writing that is duly executed by both parties.</p>
<p>9. No Assignment.<br />AFRL may not assign this Agreement or any interest herein without the VENDOR's expressed prior written consent.</p>
<p>10. Severability.<br />If any term of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement, including all of the remaining terms, will remain in full force and effect as if such invalid or unenforceable term had never been included.</p>
<p>11. Notices.<br />Any notice required by this Agreement or given in connection with it, shall be in writing and shall be given to the appropriate party by personal delivery, certified mail, postage prepaid, recognized overnight delivery services or email. Original signatures are not required by AFRL but shall be available at the request and expense of the VENDOR.</p>
<p>12. No Implied Waiver<br />Either party's failure to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance by the other party of any of the terms of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or subsequent failure to perform or delay in performance of any term hereof.</p>

The contractor shall provide 50 pounds of dry ice twice a week for 52 weeks a year, for a total of 104 occurrences. Please see attached Performance Work Statement. 2. This is only a Sources Sought Synopsis and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. 3. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. 4. The Government is contemplating North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code 424690 Other Chemical and Allied Products Merchant Wholesalers for this requirement. The size standard is 100 Employees. Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternatives must include supporting rationale. 5. No decision has yet been made regarding the type of small business set aside for this acquisition. The Government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The Government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business, and large business. Businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein the prime contractor must perform at least 50 percent of the work. 6. Respondents shall indicate in their responses whether they qualify under NAICS Code 424690 with a size standard of 100 Employees as a small business. 7. The Government contemplates a Firm Fixed Price contract. 8.

The company's standard format is acceptable; however, the limit for all responses is not to exceed twenty (20) single-sided, 12 font size, 8 &frac12; x 11-inch pages. The submitted information shall be UNCLASSIFIED. 10. Pursuant to AFFARS 5352.201 this sources sought synopsis contains the clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103 Ombudsman (APR 2010) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the AFSPC ombudsmen, A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax: 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to The Boeing Company, Navigation and Communication System, 2201 Seal Beach Blvd, Seal Beach CA 90740-, (562) 797-4674, to provide Launch and On-Orbit Support Services (LOOS) for GPS IIF satellites for CY13-CY17. GPS IIF LOOS will entail management and execution of storage, maintenance, testing, launch processing/integration, Launch and Early Orbit Operations (LEO), bus and payload checkout, and operations support to GPS IIF satellites in the operational constellation. Estimated work for launch and on-orbit support over five years is 1,000,000 labor hours. The GPS Directorate must award the LOOS contract by 1 Jan 2013 to support scheduled GPS IIF launches and continue support of on-orbit satellites. The timely launch of GPS IIF satellites is critical in meeting constellation availability, as well as providing an opportunity to complete on orbit test activities to ensure follow-on satellite production will not be impacted by late discovery of design or workmanship problems. As a part of this effort, the contractor will be required to rework/repair failed units and provide software maintenance and upgrades to flight software. This approach is designed to enable future sustainment and operation of the entire GPS IIF fleet in the constellation through all states of its constituent satellites from storage to launch and on through disposal. Lastly, the contractor will be required to demonstrate the capability to develop, test, and deploy satellite command and control systems and sustain them once deployed to fulfill the Government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. The Government intends to award this contract to the Boeing Company as the only source that can provide such services without the Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that cannot be recovered through competition (10 USC 2304(c)(1)). Successfully performing this acquisition requires the type of knowledge that could only be gained by years of experience in applying skills specific to the GPS IIF satellite (FAR 5.207(c)(15)). Specific and detailed knowledge and experience is required with GPS IIF flight software, satellite design, special test assets, U.S. Government simulation and Launch and On-orbit support facilities and launch vehicle integration with both Atlas V and Delta IV. Interested parties who believe they have the capability to provide the systems and services required may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 15 working days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis. The SOC must include the following information: Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification (Large, Small, or Other), Personnel/Size Standard and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Interested parties must also demonstrate that an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment plans described above. The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages with one inch margins, size 12 font, in Times New Roman. The Government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. Verbal responses will not be accepted. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. Any response submitted by respondents to this synopsis constitutes consent for that submission to be reviewed by Government personnel, Federally Funded Research and Development Center employees and Advisory &amp; Assistance Services contractor employees supporting SMC/GP unless the respondent clearly objects in writing to the release of this information in a cover letter accompanying your capabilities package. The notice expires 15 working days after publication. The NAICS code for this effort is 481212 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1500 employees. Capabilities information may be emailed to Mr. Todd M. Young, Contracting Officer, at Todd.Young@losangeles.af.mil.

<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information from vendors that are capable of providing a commercial High Density Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (HD-PECVD) system which is required to provide Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology NanoFab users higher density films at lower deposition temperatures. Our multi-user facility currently employs a standard parallel plate PECVD tool to deposit silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, amorphous silicon, and oxy-nitride films at 300 degrees Celsius. This current system uses Silane, Ammonia, Nitrous Oxide, Nitrogen and Oxygen gasses for film deposition and Sulfur Hexafluoride gas for plasma chamber cleans. NIST seeks a HD-PECVD system to replace the current tool with minimal facility change requirements and will entertain trade-in offers on our current Unaxis 790 PECVD system.<br />The HD-PECVD system must deposit silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, amorphous silicon, and oxy-nitride films. It must be capable of running small pieces up to 8" whole Si wafers with minimal retooling and be capable of changing deposition film type with minimal chamber clean or conditioning cycles while maintaining film properties and uniformity. Additionally, we would like to add carbon based film depositions such as diamond like carbon and silicon carbide. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the HD-PECVD that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture HD-PECVD are requested to email a detailed report/product literature to describe their capabilities to judy.pace@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The literature should include proof that the specifications can be met and any other information relevant to meeting this requirement. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to judy.pace@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) end point detector for an existing 4Wave ion beam etch system.
<p>The CNST NanoFab at NIST has an existing 4 Wave Ion Beam Etch System which it purchased in 2010 under Contract SB1341-10-SU-1148. This tool makes use of a broad Argon ion beam to slowly and uniformly mill (etch) metal layers deposited on (typically) silicon wafers up to 150 mm in diameter. NIST now has a requirement to integrate a SIMS end point detector into this existing system. The SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) analyzes the atoms emitted by the wafer undergoing the etch and is used to determine precisely when the etch process should be terminated.</p>
<p>The required SIMS end point detector shall seamlessly integrate with NIST's existing 4Wave ion beam etch system using the specific physical/geometrical configuration relative to the wafer which is proprietary to 4Wave. In addition, the SIMS hardware shall be physically compatible with the part of the existing system which is specifically machined to receive it. The SIMS software shall be capable of integration into the existing Ion Beam Etch system software, which is proprietary to 4Wave.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the replacement of components for the SIMS End Point Detector for 4Wave Ion Beam Etch System, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high speed oscilloscope with sampling doublers as well as a high resolution (12-bit) real-time oscilloscope.
<p>The CMOS Reliability and Advanced Devices Group of the Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division of the Physical Measurements Laboratory has a requirement for a high speed oscilloscope with sampling doublers as well as a high resolution (12-bit) real-time oscilloscope to support the high-definition electron spin resonance research efforts in the CMOS Device and Reliability Project. The high speed oscilloscope with two sampling doublers (to achieve a sampling rate up to 80GS/s ) will serve as a key tool to facilitate the design of a balanced microwave bridge circuit which serves as the "heart" of the high-definition electron spin resonance spectrometer currently being developed. The high resolution (12-bit) oscilloscope is necessary to read-out the microwave bridge output for accurate data acquisition.</p>
<p>Our high-definition electron spin resonance research requires a high-speed (analog bandwidth of at least 20 GHz) real-time serial data analyzer oscilloscope to aid the design and implementation of a balanced microwave bridge circuit. Our proposed measurements require minimum of four channels of hardware acquisition capable of 20 GHz analog bandwidth at 40GS/s sampling rate. Our measurement also has a particularly necessary specification of two sampling doublers to combine two channels to achieve an 80GS/s effective sampling rate. The high frequency (20GHz) and high sampling rate (80 GS/S) are required to measure the high-frequency signal (&gt; 9GHz) utilized in our balance bridge microwave circuit that serves as the "heart" of our high-definition electron spin resonance bridge.</p>
<p>Our high-definition electron spin resonance research also requires a high-resolution (true 12-bit analog to digital conversion) oscilloscope with a bandwidth of at least 400 MHz to readout the balanced microwave bridge circuit output. Our ability to balance the bridge centers on the accuracy with which we can read-out the microwave bridge output. Consequently our design requires at least 12-bits of vertical resolution and 72 dB of dynamic range on 4 different channels to increase our sensitivity to the required level necessary for successful electron spin resonance detection.</p>
<p>The required oscilloscope must be built on a high speed architecture that allows for extremely fast computations on the acquired waveforms. Our experiment requires this capability in order to average sets of sequenced waveforms to generate a single averaged waveform in near real time. <br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a High-Speed Oscilloscope/Sampling Doublers/High Resolution Realtime Oscilloscope that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture such High-Speed Oscilloscope/Sampling Doublers/High Resolution Realtime Oscilloscopes are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>

                                               STATEMENT OF WORK
 
 A.	GENERAL INFORMATION
 
 1.  Title of Project:  Extension of Smart Home Technology to Individual Homes
 
 2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.
 
 a.	Provide one full-time software engineer/developer resident at the Tampa VA for 1 year. 
 b.	Provide one full-time biomedical/biomechanical engineer resident at the Tampa VA for 1 ear.  c.	Provide one-year consultation for a computer scientist with expertise in machine-human collaboration using natural language processing.
 d.	Professional installation-service including all necessary parts, components, travel, management as required. 
e.	Provide for one-year, any necessary replacement parts, equipment and consumables (ie. batteries, cables).
 f.	Provide consulting support and service for in house design of sensors components integration. Ubisense is the manufacturer and installer of the real time location system (RTLS) and the developer of the custom software used in the Tampa VA Smart Home. For this project the contractor will provide all personnel equipment and installation services needed to equip the 5 veteran homes with our Smart Home technology. This includes a 2-year hardware and software maintenance plan as well as a redesigned, non-industrial sensor housing suitable for long-term use in a home environment.
 
 3.  Background: The Tampa VA Smart Home has been fully integrated into the Tampa Assistive Technology (AT) program providing cognitive assistive technologies to Polytrauma TBI and other cognitively impaired veterans. The original Tampa Smart Home was designed and developed in partnership with Tampa VA staff by Ubisense, Inc. as part of a contract in 2010. Specifically, Ubisense was contracted to integrate their ultra-wide band tracking hardware with the Smart Home artificial intelligence software (which Ubisense also developed).
 	
 4.  Performance Period: To install the Smart home into 5 veterans home within 1 year (365 days) from the day of the award of the service contract with an option to extend the service contract for another 2 years (3 years total) provided that funds are available for years two and three.  There may be circumstances that delay the installation of the Smart Homes and cause the project to extend beyond 365 days, such as subject recruiting schedules or other extenuating factors (for example access into veterans homes).  The contractor will provide the personnel and services  and complete the installation of the 5 Smart Homes at no additional cost during this extended contract period. The contractor will also provide for a warranty period of 1 year following the end of the contract period (or extended contract period if an extended period is required), to rectify emerging software and/or hardware failures. The contractor will not be obligated to add any additional functionality during the warranty period (unless the contract is renewed).
 
 There may be also circumstances where the government determines that it is not possible to install 5 Smart Homes (for example, because of recruitment or unforeseen technical difficulties). Should this become evident the Government will, in writing, notify the contractor that term of the contract will be modified such that that the number of installations will be reduced. If this should occur any remaining funds allocated to the excised home(s) can be rolled into extending the term of such personnel as the programmer, consultant and biomechanical engineer, beyond their 365-day contract term. How the funds will be reallocated among personnel shall be subject to negotiation between both parties (the Government and the contractor). The sites of the Tampa homes are anticipated to be within a reasonable distance from the Tampa VA (within the greater Tampa Bay Area).
 
 The contractor will make available consulting services, supply materials and equipment as necessary in order to extend and maintain the Smart Home into 5 individual homes.
 
 If the contractor proposes an earlier completion date, and the Government accepts the contractors proposal, the contractors proposed completion date shall prevail and full payment will be provided to the contractor, however the specified personnel will remain on-site at the Tampa VA for the duration of the 365 days.
 
 5.  Type of Contract: a. Service, installation and design: firm-fixed-price 2012 b. Personnel: firm-fixed-price 2012

<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of DARPA-BAA-12-22, Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology - Long Range (MIST-LR), on February 23, 2012,<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>at Schafer Corporation, Suite 300, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the MIST program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology program is developing fundamentally new electro-optic sensing capabilities to be used on airborne and ground platforms for target identification and tracking applications. The MIST-LR element of the program will focus on long-range geometric and 3-D imaging technology that will allow for target characterization beyond the physical-aperture diffraction-limit of the receiver system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>New sensing methods and techniques will be developed based on, but not limited to:</p>

<p>Current optical imaging systems can provide the capability to identify targets for specific applications or scenarios, however these systems have significant limitations defined by their size and operational range.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The physical aperture of the imaging receiver, the effects of atmospheric turbulence, performance of the receiver array, the power of the illumination source, and the image formation algorithms are the primary defining characteristics of active imaging systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DARPA believes that to meet the final program objectives, it will be necessary to implement the new sensing methods developed in MIST-LR to address all of these areas.</p>

<DESC>DRAFT INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>SPECIAL NOTICE 12&#8208;SN&#8208;0005</p>
<p>ONR Industry Day Notice<br />Tools and Models for Predicting the Magnitude and Distribution of Forces on the Towed Array System</p>
<p>General Information:<br />Classification Code: A - Research &amp; Development<br />NAICS Code: 541712</p>
<p>Description: The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct an Industry Day to present an upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) that will address the total towed array system response to the forces acting upon it as well as the reliability attributed to the entire towed array system. In order to achieve these goals, the development of tools and models is required for predicting the magnitude and distribution of forces on the towed array system during its life cycle including array storage, array deployment, array towed operation and array retrieval. Efforts will be required to characterize both handler and hydrodynamic forces that include static and dynamic, cyclic stress, and fatigue through an integrated program of modeling, experimental design, component prototype fabrication and testing, model validation, and model&#8208;based design improvements. These BAA outputs will be closely integrated with other Navy efforts to ultimately improve overall system reliability. Partnering on this BAA is greatly encouraged in order to provide the complete skill set required to be brought to bear on this subject.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Industry Day is to discuss the tools and models to be developed and applied for predicting the magnitude and distribution of forces, operational stresses, cyclic loading and mechanical stresses placed on a towed array and its constituent internal components (i.e. individual connectors,<br />wiring, strain relief, etc.) during its life cycle as it relates to the forthcoming BAA for this topic. Challenge problem areas to be addressed in the forthcoming BAA will be discussed, including modeling of hydrodynamic array streaming conditions, cylindrical turbulent boundary layer flow induced stresses at high Reynolds numbers, modeling of array handler induced stresses, and modeling of the associated reliability as it relates to the overall towed array system that encompasses the towed array and its handling system. General questions related to the pending BAA will be accepted during the meeting for<br />consideration.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Building 80, Newport, Rhode Island, 02841&#8208;1708 on Thursday, 8 March 2012. Check&#8208;in will begin at 1000 am Eastern Standard Time and the meeting will begin at 1200 noon Eastern Standard Time. Details concerning registration to attend this event are available at the following website:<br /><a href="https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=827">https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=827</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Registration will close at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, 2 March 2012. Pre&#8208;Registration is required. Walk&#8208;ins will not be permitted. Registration is limited to two (2) representatives from each organization attending the Industry Day; however, if requested attendance exceeds the capacity of the<br />conference room, it may be necessary to further limit attendance of personnel from each organization to just one (1). ONR will reply via e&#8208;mail with the registration confirmation. All expenses associated with attendance will be the responsibility of the participant(s).</p>
<p>DRAFT INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>Questions/comments resulting from the Tools and Models for Towed Arrays and Towed Array Systems Industry Day will be accepted via email from 8 March through 15 March, 2012. The limited timeframe for questions/comments is to allow for potential feedback to be incorporated into any resulting BAA.</p>
<p>Submit questions/comments to the following email address:<br />IndustryDayQuestionsToolsandModelsforTowedArraySystem@onr.navy.mil. Questions/comments shall be reviewed and will be considered when finalizing the resulting BAA.</p>

<p>Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jan 2011)</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above as well as meet the requirements in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1). Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />ii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>

Past performance is significantly more important than price, therefore the government may award this contract to other than the lowest priced proposal. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price 2) Technical Capability (Past Performance and References). Technical Capability is significantly more important than price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a price standpoint. Do not assume that you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions.

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jan 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-</p>
<p>"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant.

<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is solicited as a Total Small Business Set-aside. The NAICS Code is 811111-&nbsp;General Automotive Repair&nbsp;, with a business size standard of $7 Million. Companies with other NAICS Codes are encouraged / invited to bid as long as they are a small business in their primary business.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made to the offeror who provides the Best Value to the government based on past performance and price. Past performance is significantly more important than price, therefore the government may award this contract to other than the lowest priced proposal. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price 2) Technical Capability (Past Performance and References). Technical Capability is significantly more important than price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<DESC>The Aeronautical System Center (ASC/WISK), Battlefield Airmen Program Office seeks to acquire and field a Line of Sight-Short (LOS-S) targeting device which provides the best overall value to the government. The objective for this procurement is for the delivery of specification compliant systems in accordance with the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products and execution of the associated program support.
<p>The LOS-S is a lightweight integrated range finder/designator/sensor to enhance targeting effectiveness at ranges less than or equal to three kilometers. The need for this capability is critical and will provide the operator with increased situational awareness/understanding and an enhanced ability to shoot, move, and communicate on the battlefield. The LOS-S will be employed across the spectrum of operations for a combat controller (air traffic control, air to ground terminal control, voice and data communications, range finding, etc.).</p>
<p>The LOS-S targeting device will provide capability to acquire a target, determine target location with greater accuracy, and designate a target with greater precision. This improved precision and standoff will increase first round effects and reduce the need for re-strike. The LOS-S will be employed globally in both mounted and dismounted configurations accommodating the variety of Combat Controller load configurations. The LOS-S must be small and lightweight to accommodate the operators' operations and transportation.</p>
<p>The government's initial requirement for the LOS-S will include up to 6 prototype systems there will also be production options for up to 600 assets with approved training and sustainment to maintain the availability of all units.</p>
<p>Using the tradeoff approach, the government will consider innovative or individualized solutions to meeting the system and program requirements. However, the contractor is encouraged to provide representative systems as rapidly as possible. It is anticipated that the contractor will provide the fastest practical schedule.</p>
<p>A copy of the formal RFP number, FA8629-12-R-2421, may now be accessed via the internet at FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov. All final technical documents are now posted as of <br />10 February 2012. All questions and comments must be submitted electronically to Capt Tom Guyer, Battlefield Airmen Contracting Officer at Thomas.guyer@wpafb.af.mil. Current POC is Capt Tom Guyer and can be reached at (937) 255-3732.</p>
<p>Interested parties and offerors should obtain, read and review the complete information package to determine all technical requirements prior to submission of any offers. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government.</p>
<p>A request for information was sent for this effort under the title "LOS-S Sources Sought" dated 22 March 2011.</p>

POTENTIAL OFFERORS WISHING TO ATTEND MUST PLAN ACCORDINGLY***<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Embassy in Bamako, Mali. The U.S. Embassy requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 717,844 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks.
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation in late October 2011 or early November 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted followed by the solicitation as soon as available as the original synopsis has been posted under SAQMMA11R0209 since 10/14/2011. Then the solicitation is posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 45 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately 7 to 14 days after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted.</p>
<p>Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Michael Henderson at HendersonMP@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.</p>

It provides timely information to government users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities.

<AWARDEE>United Technologies Corp., Pratt & Whitney, Military Engines, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108 US
<DESC>Pratt & Whitney is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the F135 propulsion system and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to produce the F135 propulsion system at the required ramp rate and within the required delivery schedule.  Furthermore, P&W is the only source with the facilities and capabilities required to
provide the F135 propulsion system and associated sustainment support for the LRIP lot 6 requirements.  All prior F135 propulsion system contracts procuring propulsion systems for use in the F-35 Air System have been awarded to P&W on a sole-source basis, pursuant to the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, approved on 5 December 2008 by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics), which designated P&W as the sole source to provide the F135 Propulsion System for use in the F-35 Air System.  

Also, pursuant to the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, the Government did explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, the P&W F135 propulsion system and the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team (FET) F136 propulsion system.  The FET was awarded a F136 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract in 2005.  However, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 through FY 2011, the F136 propulsion system was not included in the Department of Defense Budget.  Congress nevertheless provided funding in FY 2007 through FY 2010 for development of the FET F136 propulsion system.  The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10) enacted on 15 April 2011 did not provide funds for the continued development of the FET F136 propulsion system.  On 25 April 2011, the FET F136 SDD contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government.  At this point in FY 2011, which is the long-lead advance procurement year for LRIP lot 6, the FET is not a viable source for LRIP lot 6 propulsion requirements.  For the reasons cited above, P&W is the only source currently capable of producing and sustaining propulsion systems for LRIP lot 6.

As a result of the FET F136 SDD contract termination, the competition opportunities envisioned in the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy are not available.  The F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy to promote competition was to explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, and therefore did not require the purchase of technical data packages for both or either the F135 propulsion system or F136 propulsion system.  As a result, the Government does not have technical data packages suitable for full and open competition of propulsion system efforts for LRIP lot 6.  

The contract type is FPIF (firm target) for the install F135 propulsion systems, of which long lead-time materials were purchased under the Advance Acquisition Contract.  Per FAR 16.403(b), a FPIF (firm target) contract type is suitable for these efforts because the nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other circumstances of the acquisition are such that the contractors assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive for effective cost control and performance and provide Government cost insight.

ORDER >$3,000
FAR PART 8.405-6(g) 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 556-12-1-2993-0012		  

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Lifeline Coordinating Svcs, Inc (dba) LCSI Guldmann Lifts	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Jerry Williams/612-991-1050	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 1459 English St., St. Paul MN 55106-1122	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Jerry Williams/612-991-1050	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	Great Lakes Acquisition Center_____
		115 South 84th Street, Suite 101______
	Milwaukee, WI  53214-1476	
	VISN 12

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Patient Lift Transfer System	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The Guldmann patient lift system is currently used at the Federal Health Care Center (FHCC).  The reason 
FHCC is requesting to have Guldmann patient lift system is primarily to address patient safety.  Using only 
one type of lift system Ensures:  Staff floating to another unit will only encounter equipment they are 
familiar with and are competent to use.  Stocking units with only one manufacturer's ceiling lift sling 
system prevents misidentification in misuse of inapprorpriate/alternate vendor slings. Facility technicians 
are already educated to repair and maintain this equipment.	
     	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $163,818.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   1/31/2012	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources. 
The Guldmann patient lift system brand is effectively being used at the FHCC.  	
FHCC Staff are proficient in use of the Guldmann patient lift systems which maintains a standardized system.
It is not beneficial to have different types of lift systems since the medical staff rotates to different areas
of the FHCC.	
     	


(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This patient lift system is provided under the FSS schedule contract number V797P-4680a.  In accordance with 
FAR 8.404 (d) the GSA has already determined the prices of supplies under this schedule contract to be fair
and reasonable.  Therefore ordering activities are not required to make a separate fair and reasonable 
pricing. 	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
The enduser conducted market research and determined the recommended contractor has a FSS	
contract and to ensure patient safety only one type of lift system should be used.	
     	
 (7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
None
     	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
