<DESC>Drug Enforcement AdministrationRequest for Information (RFI)<BR>Purpose and Background:
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Office of Forensic Sciences, seeks information from companies capable of providing neutralization, incineration, fuel blending, treatment, and disposal services for the destruction of clandestine laboratory waste and drug evidence.  Last year, DEA cleaned up approximately 10,000 clandestine drug laboratories which included drug paraphernalia, laboratory equipment, sharps waste, and trash and debris totaling approximately 2,000 tons.
DEA is considering entering into contracts with Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities, nationwide, capable of developing and implementing a national solution for efficient and environmentally friendly disposal/destruction of waste seized by Federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies and other waste generating activities authorized by DEA.  Vendors will be responsible for seizing waste/evidence and properly characterizing, packaging, and delivering it from authorized removal sites to the nearest TSDF.  The TSDF will be required to provide a Certificate of Destruction (CD) for all evidence/waste treated or destroyed at the facility, and the disposal method proposed must ensure that the seized material has been treated or destroyed to the extent that it is rendered unusable and unrecoverable and in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as Environmental Protection Agency standards.  Applicable North American Industry Classifica! tion System (NAICS) are 562211, 562212, 562213, 562219, 562920, and 562998.

List the company's name, address, phone number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, and a point of contact with email address. 5.	Indicate the company's business status (small or other than small).

Responders shall take care to clearly identify all proprietary or corporate data which shall be protected from sources outside the Government.
How to Submit Responses:All responses shall be submitted electronically (Microsoft Word for Office 2007 compatible or PDF) by 9:00 a.m. EST on Tuesday, December 21, 2010 via email to cornelia.robinson@usdoj.gov.  Please limit responses to 10 pages.

<DESC>General Information:
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) on a sole source basis for a five (5) year period (inclusive of options). This is a follow-on requirement.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide a central bioresource core facility to all members of the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network. This PS-OC Network Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF) shall serve as a biorepository and a distributor of biospecimens to the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members. This contract shall supply cancer cell lines, primary cells, DNA, RNA and protein isolates from such cells and reagents needed for the propagation of the cell lines. The Physical Sciences-Oncology Network is in need of a consistent and reliable supply of well characterized cancer cells that will be distributed on an ongoing basis to 25 to 50 laboratories throughout the United States. While breast, prostate, colorectal, brain, ovary, pancreas and lung cancers will initially be investigated, additional cancers will be of interest and thus a large number of different cell lines will be required. In addition, this contract shall supply biorepository services for the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members where they can deposit unique cell lines, primary cells and tissues that shall be characterized, authenticated, propagated and distributed to Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members upon request.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The NCI's requirement can only be met by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); they possess unique capabilities, expertise and a sizeable network. ATCC is recognized as a world leader with a history in standard biological reference materials management and the common source in scientific community for cell line stocks, with a large cell collection, well established internal procedures and well organized global distribution mechanisms. ATCC has an in-house cell culture collection that encompasses in excess of 3,600 normal cell lines and 950 cancer cell lines, which include but not limited to cancers of the breast, prostate, colorectal, brain, ovary, pancreas and lung. With their in-house collection capacity, ATCC will have the ability to supply the required materials to the Physical Sciences-Oncology Network members in an expeditious manner. ATCC has the bioresource materials in-house as well as the internal structure for storage and distribution of the materials to investigators. Based on the size and capacity of ATCC's cell collection, as well as their successful track record with cell distribution, ATCC is the only known organization that can fulfill this requirement without expending substantial costs/efforts that would be required in establishing or acquiring a network of normal and cancer cell lines of this magnitude. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to issue a solicitation on a sole source basis to Johns Hopkins&nbsp;University, entitled "Early Markers of Alzeheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and Functional Brain Changes".
<p>The proposed contract action is for R&amp;D services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
Since 1958, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has been a major research program conducted at the Gerontology Research Center (GRC) by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The BLSA is a multi-discplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Active BLSA participants are volunteers who visit the Intramural Research Program (IRP) in Baltimore, MD for testing every one to five years for 2 days. Since 1994, the program has been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, to investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and to assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging. <br /><br />The work of this contract will&nbsp;focus on the acquisition and analysis of neuroimaging data on BLSA participants. This project will&nbsp;provide important information for researchers and clinicians on age changes in brain structure and function, their associations with cognitive change, and factors that modulate these associations, including risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />The data to be collected will include assessments of brain structure, function, and amyloid deposition through MR imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and assessments of memory, other cognitive functions, and mood. Brain structure will be measured using MR volumetric brain imaging, FLAIR or other sequences that are sensitive to vascular abnormalities, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
<p>The Contractor shall acquire the neuroimaging scans and shall provide sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, including MR images collected during the initial contract period and new data during the continuation. The Contractor shall employ the refined methods for image analysis developed during the initial contract period, as well as new techniques developed as part of the proposed procurement. The Contractor shall be responsible for quantification of all PET data.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall also be responsible for contacting and scheduling the BLSA neuroimaging study participants, arranging transportation where needed, administration and monitoring of procedures during MR and PET imaging, and for administration and scoring of a neuropsychological battery, including assessments of functional status. The Contractor shall also provide a quiet space for neuropsychological testing in close proximity to the imaging facilities that is acceptable to the Project Officer. The Contractor must be located in close proximity to the NIA-IRP to facilitate repeated assessments of this unique population and to allow neuroimaging studies to be conducted in conjunction with regular BLSA visits.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks include:<br />Scheduling and Contacting Subjects: The Contractor will be provided with a list of names, telephone numbers, and addresses of eligible BLSA participants and shall be responsible for contacting and scheduling subjects. The Contractor must also provide lunch, parking and travel reimbursements (where necessary) in conjunction with imaging assessments.</p>
<p>Brief Medical Evaluation: In conjunction with the imaging assessment, the Contractor shall perform a brief medical screening, including determination of blood pressure and pulse, recording of changes in health history since last BLSA visit, and recording of current medications.</p>
<p>Imaging Procedures: State-of-the-art MR and PET image acquisition and analysis procedures are required for the performance of this contract. It is critical to the objectives of this project that comparable image acquisition and analysis procedures are maintained across subjects and years. An attempt shall be made to acquire images on the same scanner for all subjects and over time, where possible. However, it is recognized that over the duration of this contract modifications of the imaging procedures may be necessary to accommodate and take advantage of technical developments. The Contractor must advise the Project Officer of any modifications to the imaging procedures, and the initial and modified procedures must be approved by the Project Officer. Subcontracts of any part of this contract are also subject to the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>PET Imaging: The Contractor shall be responsible for all aspects of the PET imaging including preparation and management of any regulatory procedures required prior to and during the conduct of the study. The Contractor should also demonstrate sufficient flexibility to allow modification of PET imaging ligands or procedures to take advantage of new approaches as they are shown to more accurate and more sensitive predictors of cognitive decline and transition to cognitive impairment and dementia. <br /><br />Neuropsychological Testing:&nbsp; The Contractor shall be responsible for administration and scoring of a battery of neuropsychological tests to be given in conjunction with the neuroimaging evaluations. If the neuropsychological battery has been administered within the prior 3 months as part of a regular BLSA visit, the Contractor will not be required to repeat the neuropsychological testing. The neuropsychological battery shall include the following tests in the order specified: Fluent Production (FAS and Animal Naming, Boston Naming Test (Complete Version), WAIS-R Similarities Subtest, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), Clock Drawing, Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test (BIMC), Trails A and B, CVLT Delayed, BVRT Delayed, Card Rotations (Educational Testing Service), Mini-Mental Status Exam. In addition, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) shall be administered during participant waiting periods. The Contractor shall be responsible for follow-up assessments, including home visits, of any neuroimaging study participants who no longer return for BLSA and neuroimaging visits. The Project Officer or his designate will work closely with the Contractor, including training, supervision, and routine observations of assessments, to maintain consistency of the neuropsychological evaluations with the BLSA procedures. The Contractor or his designate will report to the Project Officer or his designate on a weekly basis to review BLSA subject participation and any procedural difficulties.</p>
<p>Replication, Dissemination or Use of Results. Data will be used by members of the LPC to examine the relation between changes in brain structure and function with normal aging and changes in neuropsychological performance. All data collected under this contract shall be forwarded to the LPC and a copy will be stored at the LPC. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community via presentations at scientific meetings and publications in professional journals. Collaboration of the Contractor principal and co-principal investigators with LPC Investigators in data analyses and reporting of study results will be encouraged.<br /><br />The proposed&nbsp;contractor is uniquely qualified to perform these services for the NIA based on the follwoing considerations:&nbsp; <br /><br />The Johns Hopkins University has provided all the services required to make the Early Markers of Alzheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and Functional Brain Changes study fully functional since the initiation of the study. The required services include state-of-the-art volumetric MR and PET-CBF imaging and image processing facilities, including image registration, tissue classification, stereotaxic transformation, regional and voxel-based analysis, as well as network analysis. The Contractor must have the capability to produce short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including PET 15O-water and 11C- PiB, which require an on-site cyclotron facility. In addition to image acquisition and quantification, the Contractor shall also be responsible for recruitment and scheduling of selected BLSA participants, for administration and scoring of a battery of neuropsychological tests in conjunction with the neuroimaging studies. The Contractor must be located in close proximity to the NIA-IRP to facilitate repeated assessments of this unique population and to allow neuroimaging studies to be conducted in conjunction with regular BLSA visits. Moreover, close proximity is also necessitated by the need for frequent visits to the imaging facility by the Project Officer to monitor the overall project and to ensure compatible procedures for neuropsychological assessments. PET neuroimaging evaluations of BLSA participants are acquired only through this Contract. Johns Hopkins University is the only local facility with the capability of producing the required PET radiopharmaceuticals for human use. <br /><br />This solicitation was previously advertised under sources sought announcement HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-151.&nbsp; <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is three years.<br /><br />Disclaimer and Important notes:<br /><br />This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Confidentiality<br /><br />No proprietary, classified, confidential or sensitive information should be included in your response.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Innovations Program to strengthen this important aspect.    VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation pilots will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment. 

The "Veteran Centered Care" is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.  Currently, the present format of the VHA electronic medical record creates a challenge for clinicians and other healthcare providers to locate information such as plan of care, progress toward the goals established in the plan of care to maintain optimal health for the Veteran, specific staff that are involved in active care, and how services are being coordinated without scanning through multiple notes.  These health care providers face common problems and must search through hundreds of data and entries or visit multiple locations within the electronic record. The care plan involves the active problems and interventions, medication lists, and the staff providing interventions throughout in near-real time format.  

The Contractor shall develop a functional prototype for a care plan which is accessible on the patient's electronic health record through the tool option within the Veterans Administration's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

This solicitation is 100% set aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is 511210 and the size standard is $25 million.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government.  Evaluation factors include technical, price and past performance/similar experience.  The solicitation package will be available on or about November 19, 2010.  The date for receipt of quotations is scheduled for December 17, 2010 at 12:00 noon. All relevant solicitation documents may be accessed for download on the date of issue at the following website:  http://www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments to the solicitation will be posted solely to this web site.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to verify the number of amendments issued.

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Denis Chan, Electronics Engineer, (732)532-1894<BR><BR>This source sought notice attempts to identify additional sources to meet future Legacy SINCGARS sustainment requirements. <BR><BR>US Army, CECOM-LCMC, Logistics and Engineering Operations <BR>Directorate, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000<BR><BR>58 -- Market Survey for Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)<BR>120310<BR>Denis Chan, Electronics Engineer, (732)532-1894<BR>This source sought notice attempts to identify additional sources to meet future Legacy SINCGARS sustainment requirements for the next two years.    This notice is not a solicitation for bids. Contract W15P7T-05-D-J405, a five-year Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity type contract, was awarded on a competitive basis to Tallahassee Technologies Inc.(Talla-Tech),3000 Commonwealth Blvd, Tallahassee, FL 32303 in December 2004 to procure spare parts and provide sustainment support for the General Dynamics(GD)designed family of SINCGARS (RT-1523A, RT-1523D, AM-7239 and AM-7238). The Government is currently pursuing an effort to modernize the GD family of SINCGARS via obsolescence redesign/upgrade, to extend the service life of these equipments. To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the SINCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to Talla-Tech to support this ongoing redesign effort, resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government. Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) that supports the manufacture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawings are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations. The Government is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations. The proposed contract will be an IDIQ type contract with only the initial quantity being guaranteed. The contract will include requirements for repairs and engineering service to address obsolescence issues. Due to the engineering effort that is required to manage the GD SINCGARS configuration base line, interested sources shall have demonstrated capabilities in dealing with SINCGARS or other similar frequency hopping Combat Net Radios in the following categories: a) manufacture and repair complex Circuit Card assembly (CCA), b)redesign CCA to eliminate obsolescence, c)redevelop and/or trouble shoot software, d)testing at CCA and radio system levels. In addition, interested sources must be a U.S. vendor possessing the necessary security clearance to process Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment. Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy Army sustainment requirement. FAT will be required for all sources other than Talla-Tech, that are interested in the proposed action. <BR>Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the required delivery schedule, shall respond in writing. The response shall include a short introductory description outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production capabilities. Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: CECOM LCMC, ATTN: RDER-PRC-TR (Denis Chan), Telephone: 732-532-1894, Email:  Denis.Chan@us.army.mil. <BR>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being posted on GSA eBuy and via FedBizOpps, under the Franchise Authority of the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) for the Department of the Interior, United States Park Police (USPP).
AQD is conducting market research on a new, integrated security system to gain an understanding of  security equipment capabilities, functionality, and applicability to current operations.  Based on the results of this RFI, AQD will evaluate a future Request for Quote for procurement of security system equipment and installation services.. 
This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of providing the security equipment services described herein.   The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 561621, Security Systems Services (except Locksmiths).  
The intent of this RFI is to gain awareness of the security system equipment services being utilized by industry that can accommodate the United States Park Police. The capabilities and technical characteristics presented in this RFI shall be considered as guidance only. Firms are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, information pertaining to experience on previous projects, and any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance the Governments consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 
To better assist firms with identifying possible solutions, an overview of the USPP current operations and current equipment resources are illustrated below: 
1.	Project Objectives
The specific objectives of this first phase of this modernization program are to:
A.	Provide a robust, state-of-the-art host monitoring and administrative platform for the USPPCC and the USPP Physical Security Office;
B.	Repair, convert and connect existing Access Control (ACS) and Intrusion Detection (IDS) systems at the USPP Anacostia Operations Facility (AOF) and the District Two Substation (D-2) to this new host system.
This host system capability is referred to hereinafter as the Integrated Security and Access Control System (ISACS).  This system capability may be provided as a complete on-site host computer system at the USPPCC or outsourced through a local, full service UL Listed central station provider of similar systems.
1.2	Project Options
A.	Option 1: Provide a redundant ISACS capability at the NPS National Capital Region Communications Center (NCRCC) in Hagerstown, MD.
B.	Option 2: Integrate existing intrusion and fire systems at other USPP and NPS facilities to the ISACS system, to replace the existing central station computer system used at the USPPCC and NCRCC.
1.3	Long Term Program Objectives
A.	Provide a consolidated, centralized security system with a common graphical user interface (GUI) for all operational, monitoring, and administrative activities, and common, standardized user credentials, controls and procedures at the protected remote facilities.B.	P rovide and integrate central station monitoring and control of closed circuit television (CCTV) systems and intercom systems at the remote sites with the ISACS system.C.	Design and installation of ACS and IDS electronic interfaces, controllers, processors, wiring and infrastructure to integrate with existing intrusion detectors, card readers, electric locks, exit devices and related equipment at two (2) USPP facilities.  D.	Provide the ISACS central station capabilities, either through the installation and set up of a new central station host computer system with multiple operator consoles/workstations at the USPPCC, or through outsourcing these capabilities to a local full service UL Listed central station provider with the requisite systems and monitoring capabilities.
2.     	Background and Systems Description
USPP Access Control Systems
2.1	Siemens System
2.1.1	Access Control
The security systems were installed approximately 6 years ago as part of an Infographics system provided by Siemens Building Services.  Reports in real time to an Infographics host computer system ("Cymphany") via local reader interface modules (Remote Reader Electronics) and Infographics Access Control Units (ACU) over a dedicated LAN.  The host computer and a backup are installed in the Physical Security Office at AOF.  The system at D-2 connects to the LAN and reports to this host over a T-1 line.
2.1.2	Intrusion Detection
In addition to the Siemens, a few internal spaces at these facilities are protected with keypad-controlled intrusion systems that interface with the Siemens Access Control Units.  In some instances, access to these spaces is controlled with the mechanical door key, with authorized personnel using a personal identification number (4 digit code) at the Siemens keypad to disarm the intrusion system prior to entrance.  The keypad acts only as an alarm control device used to disarm alarm sensors when the space is occupied and re-arm the sensors when the space becomes unoccupied.
In other cases, the keypad is used at a few internal spaces in conjunction with a card reader, such that the reader controls the door lock while the keypad not only control additional intrusion sensors within the space but also provides supervisory control over access control to the space.  The card reader will not provide access unless the space has first been disarmed by an authorized PIN at the keypad. This system ensures that authorized cardholders cannot access the space unless supervisory personnel are present (or have at least disarmed the system).  
These buildings are single user facilities, housing only USPP operations, but some non-USPP personnel have access cards for the facilities.  Internal intrusion systems are operational at all times and are disarmed by users only when a space is occupied.  
2.1.3	Other Systems
Both facilities utilize Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems extensively to support the ACS.  These systems are used for general area surveillance in addition to supporting visitor (non-cardholder) entry at perimeter doors.
The visitor entry system includes both intercom-based remote controls and stand-alone manual controls to unlock perimeter doors upon visitor request.  Telecor intercom desk sets are used at AOF and D-2 locations to unlock doors upon request from a visitor using the intercom unit located at a perimeter door.  Additionally, there are customized manual door controls located at both facilities which allow guard and receptionist personnel to unlock various internal and perimeter doors momentarily or for extended periods.  These controls include LED indicators, momentary door release buttons and toggle switches for extended unlocking.
These visitor systems rely on CCTV cameras at the perimeter doors for visual identification of the visitor.  The CCTV system is not interfaced with or connected in any way to the Cymphany system.  The intercom and manuals door releases remove power from the door locks but are not interfaced with or monitored by the Cymphany system.
2.1.4	Design Considerations and Installation Constraints
The Government wishes to replace this host system in its entirety and configure it to the existing card readers and door control hardware through new intelligent on-site processors and reader interface modules, using as much of the existing power supplies, wiring, conduit, boxes, enclosures and infrastructure as possible.
A.	Utilization of Existing Equipment.  The Government wishes to retain as much of the current devices, hardware and wiring as practicable to reduce the cost of this project.  However, the current location of the Infographics ACU in the plenum instead of accessible closets makes the use of those enclosures and associated wiring impractical, except as junction box locations.  
The Government believes that existing card readers, electric door locks, exit devices, and intrusion sensors can be used in place, with little or no modification.  The Infographics ACU, Remote Reader Electronics, intrusion keypads and other equipment believed to be proprietary to the Infographics system probably cannot be used. The keypads produce a Wiegand output like the HID card readers but have been troublesome and may not be compatible with other systems
B.	HSPD-12 Compliance.  At this time it is believed that compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) will NOT apply to the access control systems for these facilities.  All current USPP employees will be enrolled in and required to carry the DOI-Access card (the HSPD-12 smartcard) but that card will not be used at any doors currently controlled by the HID readers.  The Contractor may propose a host system that can support reading the facility access control data from the DOI-access card, provided that the card conforms to the requirements in HSPD-12 and FIPS 201.
C.	Visitor Systems Interface.  The door release systems described in paragraph 2.1.3 above remove power from the respective door locks for visitor entry. The Contractor will have to take these controls into consideration, such that an unlocked door status resulting from visitor control action can be differentiated from failure of a door to lock caused by a power failure or door/sensor misalignment.
D.	Conversion in an Operating Environment.  AOF (which houses the D-5 Substation in addition to other operations) and the D-2 Substation are operating police stations and use the access control and intrusion systems 24 hours a day.  
Some areas will require special consideration.  For example, a prisoner holding area exists at each substation, featuring an interlock at a mantrap to each holding area.  There are card readers with keypads on each side of the two doors to the mantrap, for entry into and exit out of the mantrap, and only one door can be opened at a time.  Also, the holding area itself cannot be accessed by the Contractor when prisoners are being processed.
Although the Government does not anticipate significant delays or impediments to the Contractor's work because of these operating conditions, the Contractor must plan carefully around them.  The Government is not aware of any conditions that will require the performance of any work outside normal business hours.

E.	Relocation of USPPCC to AOF. 
The USPP recently relocated its communications center from the USPP HQ at 1100 Ohio Drive, SW, to the current location at AOF.  This AOF location features four operator consoles plus a management console, each of which includes capabilities to operate the radio dispatch system and other law enforcement support computer systems.  There are 2 PCs at each console.  
The SIMS alarm computer system currently used to monitor USPP and NPS intrusion and fire systems at other remote sites is currently operational at only one of these consoles.  
Providing the ISACS functionality at each of the 4 operator consoles and the manager's console is a desired goal of this project.  That functionality may be provided on an existing PC at each console or via a separate host computer and networked to each console.  
3.	Equipment Locations and Quantities
There are approximately forty (40) card reader-controlled locations at AOF and twelve (12) at the D-2 substation.  Additionally, there is a local intercom system currently in place at both facilities that allows a local attendant to unlock certain doors for visitors and other non-cardholders upon verification through voice intercom and a local CCTV system.
ISACS should be sized to accommodate at least 200 card readers to allow for future expansion to other USPP and NPS sites.  This number includes intelligent keypads which may be used for IDS control, or for ACS control in lieu of a card reader. 
There are approximately 800 authorized cardholders currently in the system.  The system should be sized to accommodate at least 5,000 active cards.
3.1	USPP Communications Center
Multiple civilian dispatchers are on duty at all times at the USPPCC.  These personnel are engaged in a variety of duties including police dispatch, alarm monitoring and telephone answering.  Duties are shared among all operators as necessary.  A single SIMS alarm console is currently utilized to process alarms for intrusion and fire systems installed at other NPS and USPP locations
At a minimum, USPPCC shall be equipped with one operator console for any on-site ISACS system proposed.  Optimally, the Government wishes to have ISACS alarm processing capability at all four (4) dispatcher/security monitor positions plus the manager's console, with a common user interface to access the various radio dispatch and security monitoring applications at each position
The Government will also consider outsourcing some or all the ISACS capabilities, with no on-site host equipment to be provided under this SOW.
Automated Access Control Systems (ACS) are currently installed at all five USPP district substations in Washington, DC, the USPP Headquarters Building, and the USPP Aviation Facility.  All these facilities utilize proximity-type access cards and card readers from HID Corporation, along with a variety of electric locks, exit devices and door position sensors to control access.  Some HID readers include an integral keypad in addition to the reader, requiring the use of a 4 digit personal identification number (PIN) in addition to the card to gain entry.
4.	General Features
The Government desires a central station system that is flexible, expandable and adaptable to a wide range of physical security needs, primarily in the areas of automated access control and intrusion detection system monitoring.  The primary objectives at the central station are to provide operators with the degree of situational awareness necessary to perform correct actions promptly and efficiently, to minimize nuisance and false alarms, and to require operator awareness, acknowledgement, response and intervention only for activities that require it.
From the user and consumer perspective, the objective is to provide access control and intrusion detection systems that require appropriate credentials but no special knowledge to gain access to a user's space.  For the administrator, security manager and database maintainer, the goal is to provide a single user-friendly interface to a central database for card administration, database administration, event analysis and customer services.
5.	Basic ISACS Operation
ISACS will replace the current Cymphany system with a reliable, user-friendly interface that will facilitate both central station monitoring actions and administrative controls.  The system will accept the existing USPP cardholder database (through manual data entry) and allow assigned cards to work at existing card readers according to reader location, time of day and day of week restrictions assigned by the Government.  
Routine access events may be logged to disk only, annunciated and/or displayed on the operator's console, printed to a system printer, or any combination of these, as programmed by the Government.  
6.	Event Processing
6.1	Commonly Understood Event Terminology
System events shall be recorded and presented to security monitors and consumers in easily understood English terminology, rather than technical jargon requiring references to technical manuals.   
6.2	Records Retrieval
Historical data shall be searchable and retrievable according to a wide variety of criteria, and printable to file or printer such that the end user/consumer can understand the data without requiring references to equipment lists and system manuals.
6.3	Selective Event Processing
The System shall have the capability to control the processing of selected events through hardware/firmware at the on-site location and/or software at the host.  The host should receive and process device changes of state only when a record of the action is required or an operator action may be necessary.  
6.4	Nuisance Event Avoidance
Device changes of state associated with an intrusion detector or any monitored equipment point should be configurable either through hardware or software so that multiple repetitive events do not annunciate and display unnecessarily at the operator's console.  Operator acknowledgement and alarm processing as well as user corrective actions shall be recorded on disk and readily retrievable in an easily understandable chronological report format with the initiating alarm event.
6.5	Flexible Event Message Creation and Operator Log Messages
Event messages shall be user configurable to allow English descriptions of the situation that caused the event to occur as well as the "alarm advice" needed by the operator to respond appropriately to the event.  The operator shall be able to input a log message associated with the event to describe in detail the actions that were taken in response to the alarm.  Alarms that remain active after operator action shall remain observable in some type of queue or window so that follow up actions can be taken, until the alarm condition is corrected by an authorized user or operator.  All operator actions and log messages shall be logged to disk and retrievable with the associated alarm events.
7.	Events to be Monitored
7.1	Events From Monitored Sites
"	Card accesses - by card number and cardholder name"	Access denials - by card number, cardholder name, and reason for denial;"	Door prop open conditions;"	Failure of electric lock to lock;"	Opening of a card reader controlled door without use of an authorized card of exit device;"	Intrusion alarms by type, class, and priority;"	Individual intrusion system arming and disarming, with user name (whether by card or PIN);"	Equipment tamper alarms;"	Power failures and low battery indications;"	Wiring grounds and circuit faults;"	Equipment trouble alarms and failures;
7.2	ISACS Diagnostics
ISACS shall be capable of detecting and reporting the following self-diagnostics, at a minimum:
"	System device failure - any hardware component in the computer system;"	Communications failures of any kind;"	Uninterruptable power supply failures.
8.	Optional Capabilities
8.1	Cardholder Photos, Facility Images and Maps
USPP currently uses a stand-alone computerized photo badging system for its personnel. The photo badge is worn for identification purposes during the duty day by civilian and non-uniformed personnel.  At this time it is believed that force-wide implementation of the HSPD-12 credential will not eliminate or otherwise impact this procedure.
At present, the photos are stored in the badging computer but there is no electronic interface between that computer and the Cymphany system.  
RFI - Submission Requirements
The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.

Each IDIQ total amount (including options) should not exceed $5 million aggregate.  All successful IDIQ awardees shall be guaranteed a minimum of $10,000 of work for the full contract performance period.  <BR><BR>Successful offerors shall be required to meet specific access requirements that shall be identified per Task Order.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  This Request For Information (RFI) is to be used for information gathering and planning purposes only.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, VA, and the Program Executive Office, Land Systems (PEO LS) Program Manager Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement/Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (PM MTVR/LVSR), Quantico, VA, are seeking information from industry on commercial-off-the-shelf solutions that would provide a common display system capability.  The Vehicle Common Display (VCD) will command, control, and display multiple subsystems from a single user interface.
 MARCORSYSCOM and PM MTVR/LVSR request limited information regarding ONLY the common display system. This is a follow-on to an RFI and Industry Day conducted in March 09; and is intended to provide the Government with information required to prepare a planned solicitation for Common Display systems, including gaining a better understanding of the current state of technology in this area.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) tactical and combat vehicle programs are facing space limitation problems.  Specifically, USMC vehicles are limited in size, weight, power, human factors, and safety resulting from integrations of required government electronics systems. Each new electronics system requires its own display/monitor/control panel, using significant Space, Weight and Power (SWAP) allotments, negatively impacting safe and effective operation of the vehicles.
  Through joint efforts with TARDEC and SPAWAR, MARCORSYSCOM has established a common display system proof of concept and developed a performance specification for the system.  Present efforts are focused on finding a compatible ruggedized display screen/monitor to support the system.  The desired display units should meet requirements identified on the attached Specification Sheet.

A Demonstration Day for industry is planned for 3 December 2010.  Industry is invited to view a fully integrated Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), including the SPAWAR Charleston proof of concept common display system, for the purpose of providing the Government with information  regarding common display systems, and integration of those systems into USMC vehicles.
  Detailed Instructions for registering for Demonstration Day are attached to this announcement.  Registration is restricted to U.S. citizens.    

Firms possessing the capabilities to accomplish this requirement are invited to submit the following: Company information to include the business size (large business, small business, 8(a), veteran owned small disadvantaged business, etc); Statement of capabilities and current GSA contract information (if available on GSA); and any comments regarding the proposed Specifications for the Common Display system. Proprietary information submitted in response to this synopsis will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary. Responses to this RFI should be mailed or delivered via FEDEX, UPS, or DHL to the following address no later than 3:00 p.m.
 EST, 31 January 2011. No phone calls will be accepted:  MARCORSYSCOM, Attn: Maryanne Smiley (PEO LS-MTVR/LVSR), 2200 Lester Street, Building 2208, Quantico MCB, VA 22134.  Submissions in response to this RFI will be accepted from  6 December 2010 to 31 January 2011.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

MARCORSYSCOM representatives may or may not choose to meet with vendors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.  Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Karen A. Matsushima, Contracting Officer, at Karen.Matsushima@usmc.mil.
  Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.  Questions will be answered by posting answers to the NECO and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) websites, accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 3:00 p.m. EST, 29 November 2010 will be answered.  
  
This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to enter into a contractual agreement or will the Government pay for any information solicited.  Further, the Marine Corps Systems Command is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.
  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offeror(s) to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.

It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 7, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<DESC>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Fort Rucker, AL and surrounding area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<BR><BR>Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice with the following information. <BR><BR> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Fort Rucker, AL and surrounding area?<BR>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<BR>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<BR>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<BR>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<BR>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<BR>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<BR>Mobile Engineer District contract?<BR><BR>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than 26 November 2010.  Mail, or E-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Mobile, Attn: CESAM-CT/Mr. Carl Wade, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628; E-mail  carl.m.wade@usace.army.mil.

Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR><BR>1.	The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is working with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) to evaluate the performance of millimeter wave (MMW) sensors to defeat buried objects.  During previous research a large test bed was constructed and instrumented to collect detailed information regarding environmental conditions before, during, and after testing.  Automated environmental monitoring instrumentation stations were constructed using instrumentation from Campbell Scientific to collect the needed data, which have been used as validation information for the construction of the computational test bed.  Additional such stations have been developed and deployed in additional CONUS and OCONUS locations.<BR><BR>2.	Current research requires the development of additional stations which can be deployed to collect similar data to allow environmental data to be collected to support the modeling of additional sites representing a broader array of environmental conditions. <BR><BR>3.	For the purposes of consistency with instrumentation packages established at JIEDDO and GEOTACS locations, both CONUS and OCONUS, it is required that the instrumentation setup for the present research incorporate the same Campbell Scientific, Inc., components for consistency of data output and comparison to historical data and to provide for interchange of replacement parts between stations.  These instruments include a weather station with its associated wind, temperature, humidity, and energy measurement devices, subsurface soil moisture, temperature, and heat flux instruments, and surface radiometers. Instrument details are below.<BR><BR>Item 1: HMP50-L15 18008-59 Vaisala Temperature/RH  		QTY: 8<BR>Description:<BR>The HMP50 measures both temperature and relative humidity and is suitable for long-term, unattended monitoring.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-11-AA03 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAICS is 111421 and business size is $0.75 million. This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46.<br /><br />The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has a need for nursery grown Arundo donax plants. The USDA laboratory requires delivery of 6,500 plants over a 13 week period with the option to increase the quantity by an additional 6,500 plants over a 13 week period for a total of 13,000 plants over 26 weeks.<br /><br />The following will detail the specific requirements. Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S. Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users. Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species. USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.<br /><br />Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program.<br /><br />1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants.<br /><br />2) Contractor will provide weekly deliveries 500 (every Monday and Thursday) of 250, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants.<br /><br />3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants that are 18-24 inches tall and have a minimum of 3 stems emerging from the rhizome.<br /><br />4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any nsecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval).<br /><br />5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) that are field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas. The main bud must be cut from the rhizome to stimulate multiple lateral buds.<br /><br />6) Plants must be grown in native LRGV sandy loam soil or soil mix as specified by USDA. Soil PH will be specified by USDA.<br /><br />7) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops. Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter.<br /><br />8) Plants may need to be fertilized with fertilizer as required by USDA.<br /><br />9) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 week from field harvest.<br /><br />10) Contractor will deliver plants to greenhouse facilities at USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N. Moorefield Rd., Edinburg, TX 78541 or at USDA, ARS, South Farm, 2301 S. International Blvd., Weslaco, TX 78596.<br /><br />11) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with one 30 days of prior notice.<br /><br />12) USDA reserves the right to increase the number of plants delivered each week with advance notice to the grower. Advance notice will account for the time it takes for the grower to dig and grow the optimum plant.<br /><br />13) Period of the performance is 13 weeks beginning approximately February 15, 2011 and extending an additional 13 weeks if option is exercised.<br /><br /><strong>PLEASE PRICE THE BASE AND OPTION AS SEPARATE LINE ITEMS.<br /></strong><br />Line Item 001 BASE&nbsp; 6,500ea @ _________ = $_______<br />Line Item 002 Option&nbsp; 6,500ea @ ________ = $_______<br />Grand Total BASE&nbsp;+ OPTION = $_________<br /><br />Price to include delivery to the USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N Moorefield Road, Edinburg, Texas 78541.

<p>SEE STATEMENT OF WORK BELOW:</p>
<p>Range Information System for Utah Test and Training Range<br />Background: <br />There is a need for a Range Information System (RIS) for the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR). Its purpose is to broadcast continuous, automated and timely range status reports to military aircraft using the UTTR during operational hours and civilian aircraft when the range is closed. Currently range status updates are delivered to military aircraft by either range schedulers or air traffic controllers, often multiple times due to changing range conditions. This is a time intensive job for schedulers and controllers and it is difficult to ensure pilots have the most current, coordinated conditions due to the physical separation of the two agencies. Outside of range hours, closure information and range conditions are not currently available to civilian aircraft. Installation of a RIS, in coordination with the existing Information Display System (IDS5), will greatly enhance pilot's ability to receive current and reliable information to meet their crucial decision timeframe, increasing improving safety of range users and aircraft in the surrounding airspace. It will reduce workload on the UTTR schedulers and controllers.<br />Operational Requirements:<br />1. Must interface with IDS5 installed at the UTTR to allow single action input of data. The preferred method of operation for the system requires data to be entered in the IDS5 system via drop-down menus or typed input and this data to be sent to the RIS for voice conversion and radio transmission.<br />2. The RIS System must have a fall back capability allowing direct entry into the system via either typed data or spoken voice.<br />3. When RIS data is changed to reflect new conditions it must present an alert visible to all IDS5 users, display the current out-going message and version, and allow controllers to acknowledge the changes.<br />4. Once data is updated and acknowledged, the change should be automatic, and the status broadcast should change at the next broadcast activation, and the Notice to Airman (NOTAM) version annotation should be automatically updated.<br />5. Because of the interface with the IDS5 system, only one ATIS station will be required to reside in the UTTR Air Operations Center (AOC), and interface via Ethernet type connection to a radio control box that controls and interfaces via a standard communication system with dedicated radios<br />6. The radio control unit must be able to control a minimum of four (4) radios, using standardized keying schemes (i.e. 2 wire keying) and allow for a 2 wire audio transmit and 2 wire audio receive interface. Keying will be available in both operator select and continuous mode.<br />7. The radio control unit must be able to select, via software, which one of the radios will receive the data and transmit it independently of the other radios.<br />8. The radio control unit must have a fail-safe mode so should it fail it does so in non-keying mode.<br />9. The RIS interface with IDS5 must not affect IDS5 accreditation status, and the entire system should fall under the Information Assurance Accreditation umbrella.</p>
<p>Constraints:<br />1. System must be delivered, installed and operating not later than 3 Months after reciept of Award.<br />2. Necessary training and materials must be made available to allow local technicians/controllers to maintain and operate system.<br />3. A site test acceptance procedure will be developed by the manufacture and coordinated between the UTTR Quality Assurance (QA) personnel and UTTR users/maintainers. <br />4. An site acceptance test will be conducted at the UTTR and involved the local QA personnel.<br />5. 388 RANS/RSL must be kept advised of progress of development and fielding of system on a regular recurring basis.<br />6. Installation of the system will take place on a non-interference basis with the UTTR mission.<br />7. Any company technicians will need to provide the necessary information required to access to the controlled areas where the installation will take place.<br />8. Installation will take place in accordance with applicable Air Force regulations and policies.<br />9. System shall be warranted for a minimum of one year.</p>
<p>Delivery date is 3 months after reciept of award. The invoice will be received and accepted by the Government by the tenth day after reciept of order at Hill AFB, UT 84056 on an FOB Destination Basis.

Description of Requirements:The contractor will identify and engage five independent, well-qualified, experts to review the Marbled Murrelet Wind Turbine Collision Model for the Radar Ridge Wind Resource Area (collision risk model) developed by West Inc.  Five people are needed due to the specific and differing disciplines which will be needed to conduct a thorough review.  The purpose of this independent scientific peer review is to obtain an unbiased review of the Collision Risk Model and related assumptions.  The review shall also determine whether reported avian collision risk model results are indicative of potential take of murrelets that is reasonably certain to occur as a result of construction and operation of the Radar Ridge Wind Energy Project.  In addition, the reviewers will review the observation data collected of murrelets at the proposed site (and used in the avian collision risk model) in the document entitled "Use of Radar to Determine Rates and Height Distributions of Marbled Murrelets at the Proposed Radar Ridge Wind Resource Area, Pacific County, Washington".  Murrelet radar data has been collected by Hamer Environmental.  West Inc. and Hamer Environmental are contractors who gathered the data and constructed the model that is being reviewed.  The collision risk model, with its corresponding appendices, equations and code will be provided to the contractor.  (see attached Appendix A, Statement of Work)

APPENDIX AF11PS00145Statement of Work
Peer Review of the Simulation Model Entitled: Marbled Murrelet - Wind Turbine Collision Risk Model for the Radar Ridge Wind Resource Area, March 16, 2010
Energy Northwest (EN) is applying to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for an incidental take permit for a wind energy project to take marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) (murrelets), a species listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  As part of the Radar Ridge Wind Energy Project Habitat Conservation Plan, a collision risk model developed by West Inc. is used to predict potential collisions of murrelets with the wind turbines, and ultimately, estimate potential incidental take.  Inputs to the avian collision risk model rely on data and reports from marine radar surveys conducted at Radar Ridge by Hamer Environmental.  EN, FWS, and the Bonneville Power Administration have agreed through a Memorandum of Understanding to conduct an independent peer review of the collision risk model.
The purpose of this independent scientific peer review is to obtain an unbiased review of the Collision Risk Model and related assumptions.  It should also help determine whether reported avian collision risk model results are indicative of potential take of murrelets that is reasonably certain to occur as a result of construction and operation of the Radar Ridge Wind Energy Project.
Statement of Work
The contractor will identify and engage five independent, well-qualified, experts to review the Marbled Murrelet Wind Turbine Collision Model for the Radar Ridge Wind Resource Area, 16 March 2010 (collision risk model) developed by West Inc.  The peer reviewers will also review the observation data collected of murrelets at the proposed site (and used in the avian collision risk model) in the document entitled Use of Radar to Determine Rates and Height Distributions of Marbled Murrelets at the Proposed Radar Ridge Wind Resource Area, Pacific County, Washington (murrelet radar data) collected by Hamer Environmental.  The collision risk model with its corresponding appendices listed below, equations and code will be provided to the reviewers, along with a copy of this Statement of Work (SOW).
The contractor will use the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Policy on Committee Composition and Balance and Conflicts of Interest available at http://www.nationalacademies.org/coi/index.html to identify potential conflicts and biases on the part of potential reviewers to ensure an independent and unbiased review.  The reviewers shall not be members of the FWS, state fish and wildlife agencies, and organizations expressing advocacy positions related to wind energy projects, murrelets and their management under the Endangered Species Act.  Nor shall they have any financial interest in the outcome of their review, including any ongoing or pending contracts with EN (West Inc., Hamer Environmental and ABR), any of the public utilities involved, or expected major consumers of the electrical output of the project.  Reviewers may contact the FWS representative if necessary, for clarification of, but not limited to, comments, process, assumptions, or calculations relative to the documents associated with this SOW.  At the discretion of the FWS representative, he may approve the reviewers contacting the EN contractors for further questions and clarifications.  At the discretion of the FWS representative, he may participate in the discussions between the EN contactors and the reviewers.
When the contactor has completed the review, it will be provided to the FWS representative.  The FWS representative will provide the review to EN, Bonneville Power Administration, Washington State Department of Natural Resources, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, collectively, the stakeholders.  From the date of signing the contract with the FWS, the contractor will have 60 days to provide the review responses to the FWS representative.
The reviewers will not be anomymous.  The contractor shall determine that the reviewers will have the appropriate technical expertise such as simulation modeling, collision risk modeling, statistics, mathematics, radar physics, murrelet ecology, and other necessary expertise.  Reviewers will also attend and present their analyses to an interactive panel consisting of the stakeholders.
The following questions and tasks were developed by the FWS, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Washington State Department of Natural Resources.  Appendix 8 of this Statement of Work contains West Inc.'s and Hamer Environmental's responses to these agency questions and explains revisions made to the collision risk model.  While appendix 8 and the other appendices are relevant for the review, it is expected that reviewers will independently conduct their own analyses and responses for the following questions and tasks.
1)	Run sensitivity analysis to determine the suite of parameters that drive model output and perform an uncertainty analysis consisting of additional model simulations aimed at quantifying prediction intervals given uncertainties in key model inputs and internal parameter values.
2)	Is the collision-risk model (including sub-components such as the Tucker Model) the most-appropriate model to assess risk of collision of murrelets with wind turbines?  Are there better approaches to evaluate potential collision risks?
3)	How can the existing model (in whole or in part) be improved to maximize its utility in predicting collision risk frequency of murrelets with wind turbines at the proposed site?
4)	Are the survey data spatially and temporally adequate to represent the full spectrum of murrelet behavior in the project area throughout a calendar year?  Are the survey sample sizes adequate?  If not, what would you recommend to improve the utility of information available for representing murrelet behavior in the proposed project area?  Do the modelers extrapolate the survey data correctly to compensate for under-sampled and non-sampled times and places and weather conditions?  What are the statistical biases introduced to the simulation output given these extrapolations?  How can these biases be incorporated into the interpretation of the model predictions and to inform decision makers regarding predicted collision frequency?
 5)	What are the potential consequences on model output of using the existing data?"	Relationships between flight height and weather conditions were not established because reliable radar data cannot be collected when rain is falling "	Inbound/outbound flights by murrelets "	Seasonal occurrence of murrelets "	Time of day when murrelets are detected 
6)	What are the major assumptions of the collision-risk model?  What are the consequences on model output of using the existing assumptions?  Overall, are the assumptions in the model report reasonable and probable?  Specific assumptions in need of further evaluation with regard to effects on model output include the following:"	Uniform passage rates throughout project area"	Single radar point representing 1.4 birds (Is radar precise enough for this modeling application to determine flight heights and flock size of murrelets?)"	Avoidance percentage rates are modeled for stationary objects and active rotors.  Are the avoidance probabilities reasonable and based on observation or supposition?  How do outputs change with different avoidance assumption percentages?
If possible, please express responses to this question in the form of model output prediction intervals, analogous to statistical confidence intervals. 
7)	Verify computer program performance (i.e., model verification).  Check that program outputs are correct given a set of program inputs. 
8)	How can we use this model to estimate incidental take into the future, given dynamic ecosystem changes that may influence murrelet distribution and abundance and, therefore, passage rates?  How would model predictions (i.e., number of collisions) change given uncertainty regarding future murrelet abundance and behavior that influence passage rates at the proposed site? 
9)	Given the sensitivity analysis results and responses to questions (5) and (6), how can we use this model to aid in the design of a monitoring plan and adaptive management plan? 
10)	Verify the accuracy of the assumptions and calculations regarding curtailment and the resulting murrelet collision rate.
In addition to the 10 specific questions and tasks above, the reviews shall respond to the following questions, explaining in as much detail as possible: "	Are the authors' conclusions well supported by the best available scientific data? "	Do the conclusions follow logically from the scientific data and analyses? ?"	Did the authors appropriately utilize assumptions drawn from the best available scientific data in conducting their analyses and forming their conclusions? "	Did the authors fail to consider or discuss any important and applicable scientific information? "	Did the authors misinterpret important scientific data or draw errant conclusions from it? "	Are the results reached by the avian collision risk model reasonable in view of the best available scientific information? 
The successful bidder must demonstrate the ability to perform in three areas: 1)	Ability to identify and have access to well-qualified reviewers who are willing to perform a high quality, independent and unbiased scientific peer review. 2)	Ability to manage a high quality scientific peer review including the necessary contracting mechanisms to provide honoraria or financial compensation to reviewers. 3)	Ability to meet the deadline for completion of the scientific peer review and to deliver high quality scientific peer reviews.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">The 183rd FW, is hereby issuing solicitation W91SMC-11-R0004, for Teknion Brand Name furniture to match existing systems furniture within the Base&nbsp;to meet the same design standard. The requirement is to supply furniture to&nbsp;16 different rooms to include systems furniture, break room furniture, filing,&nbsp;conference room furniture, seating, etc... The Government has determined the use of&nbsp;Teknion for this furniture requirement is required to meet the government's need. The required furniture is proprietary nature to Teknion. Teknion is the manufacturer of all existing "new" furniture throughout the Base, and to ensure and maintain compatibility with existing and concurrent purchases, the&nbsp;Base requires this brand of furniture. Manufacturers, other than&nbsp;Teknion cannot offer the level of product integration between&nbsp;administrative furniture lines. Market research also indicated other system furniture brands were not physically compatible with&nbsp;Teknion furniture. Typically systems furniture is not interchangeable between brands. Additionally, typically other brands cannot match the exact finishes used by Teknion. Offers are due on 17 December 2010 at 1:00PM CST.&nbsp; Questions may be directed to MSgt Brent Keller, 183d FW Base Contracting Officer @ 217-757-1251</span> or brent.keller@ang.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Infrastructure/Geophysical Division (DHS S&amp;T IGD) seeks technologies to improve and increase the nation's preparedness for and response to natural and man-made threats through superior situational awareness, emergency response capabilities, and critical infrastructure protection. The focus of&nbsp;BAA 10-11 is the Real-Time Analysis Communication Environment (RACE), which is in the area of modeling and simulation, and meets the expressed high-priority technologies for the Complex Event Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (CEMSA) system for integration into the Risk Development and Modeling Branch (RDMB) capability portfolio of existing modeling and simulations systems. RDMB managers the in-depth Critical Infrastructures and Key Resources (CIKR) analysis leveraging advanced modeling and simulation and capability development mandated by Congress.&nbsp;The work completed under this BAA will enhance the&nbsp;Congressionally&nbsp;mandated National and Regional analysis, modeling, and simulation capability of analyzing disruptions on CIKR within the time constraints of rapid decision cycles. <br /><br />In order to rapidly achieve an analysis capability to address disruptions to CIKR systems and estimate impact at the local, regional and national levels, RACE will leverage the current Risk Development and Modeling Branch portfolio of analysis, modeling,&nbsp;and simulation tools. The result will be a set of tools complementing CEMSA and being interoperable across the suite of RDMB models and visualization systems which will operate within the Hierarchical Yet Dynamic Reprogrammable Architecture Critical Infrastructure Risk Decision Analysis System environment. In addition to support the mission needs to work with sensitive data and to support a broad set of customers RACE must operate on both unclassified DHS networks and on the Homeland Security Data Network (HDSN) at the secret level. The Principal Investigator and any of his/her team who will have access to the Homeland Security Data Network must hold a secret security clearance.

<p><strong><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

 Award shall be made to the responsive, responsible offeror determined to have the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.  Successful offers must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx) and provide representations and certifications either electronically online (https://orca.bpn.gov/) or in writing by obtaining a written form by request from the Contracting Officer.  

The Service Contract Act may apply to this procurement.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Each offeror shall complete the following certification in accordance with FAR 52.222-52:
The offeror __ does __ does not certify that:
(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; 
(2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; 
(3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593</p>

<DESC><p><strong>*** UPDATE 12 APR 10 ***</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100 and PIXS6441.</p>
<p>This notice is a follow-on sources sought synopsis to FBO # PIXS6441 posted on 23 Feb 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p><strong>All substantive portions of the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis are incorporated by reference. The purpose of this follow-on sources sought synopsis is to clarify FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting." Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." It is the intention of the government to pursue the standard FAR clause language, wherein the small business prime contractor must intend to perform and demonstrate the capability to perform at least 50 percent of the entire scope of work described in the draft Performance Work Statement.</strong></p>
<p>Companies that responded to the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis, please respond with your company name and confirm your interest in acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor, considering ability to comply with FAR 52.219-14. It is not necessary to resubmit any other information unless there has been a change.</p>
<p>Companies that did not respond to the previous sources sought synopsis, please respond with all of the information listed below. Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:</p>

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests.

This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>**Questions & Responses Added - Updated w/additional Q&As 11/19**<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed. <BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide mast mounted surveillance cameras. The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of mast mounted day/night cameras in order to accomplish these efforts. Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>2.

The REF is seeking two systems for delivery of 60 days ARO.<BR><BR>Q6. Is the expectation that cameras will be able to see items placed in a<BR>culvert (i.e. at the opening) or that the cameras will have video analytics<BR>to be able to detect someone placing an item in a culvert?<BR>A6. No.<BR><BR>Q7. How will the output from the laser range finder be used, are there existing<BR>capabilities that will use this information or is it just to provide ground<BR>personnel the location of a target?<BR>Q7.

<DESC><p>The anticipated issuance of the request for proposal has been changed from mid November to late November or early December 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution is notifying its intent to solicit for a Construction Management at Risk Contract (CMc) for the construction of the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE (NMAAHC). The proposed contract listed here is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Smithsonian. It is anticipated that a request for proposal Solicitation F11SOL10001 will be issued in mid November 2010. The new NMAAHC museum will be constructed on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The site is approximately five acres in area and bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements to be used for outdoor museum programs in a manner consistent with its context and contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall. The facility program calls for a new museum building of approximately 330,000 gross square feet which will be a place of collaboration with museums and other organizations to promote the study and appreciation of African American life and its impact on the nation and the world. The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220 and the size standard under this code is $33.5 million average annual receipts over the last three years. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. If the selected firm is a large business, a subcontracting plan consistent with PL 95-507, PL 99-661 and PL 100-656 will be required with the final fee proposal.

The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection. An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>Research to identify advanced integrated vehicle and component technology conceptsthat will allow subsonic transport aircraft to simultaneously meet the NASA subsonictransport system level goals of reduced noise, emissions and fuel burn in the 2025 (orbeyond) time frame. These advanced vehicle concepts must operate efficiently within theNextGen airspace system that is currently being developed. It is believed that to achieverequired aircraft SRL in this time frame, all critical technologies that could beconsidered enabling technology need to be at a TRL level of 6 by 2020.  The results ofthis study are meant to be complementary to a number of on-going and planned governmentprograms such as the FAAs CLEEN program, NASAs SFW Project, and a number of Departmentof Defense programs.

For the requirements synopsized herein, Talton Communications, Inc. is the only source that will satisfy the government's needs. The contemplated contract modification will be awarded pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This notice is for Modification P00055 to Contract DASG60-02-D-0006, titled Warfighter Analysis & Integration increasing the contract value by $11,879,381.  The basic award of Contract DASG60-02-D-0006, an ID/IQ contract, was made to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) on 17 Dec 01 as a result of full and open competition.  A full and open competitive follow-on requirement was solicited, evaluated, and contract awards were made, followed by a CICA stay of performance due to a GAO Protest on the awards.  Although the protest was withdrawn on 16 Nov 2010, there is insufficient contract value remaining to support all of the existing critical requirements during the transition period to the new Warfighter contract vehicles.  A Justification and Approval (J&A) For Other Than Full and Open Competition Document Control No. JA 2010-30, was approved on 20 Sep 2010 for this contract modification.  The total proposed value of this action is $11,879,381 for 126,045 DPPH to provide continued support pending transition to the new contract vehicle(s), with the contract period of performance extended to 31 Jan 11.
