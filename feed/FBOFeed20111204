<DESC>This contract will be for construction of Phase 1B site environmental remediation for Dense Non-aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) Soil Stabilization at the Atlantic Wood Industries Superfund Site located in Portsmouth, Virginia.  The site is a former wood treating facility.  Work shall consist of the in-situ remediation of approximately 45,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil to a depth of up to approximately 25 feet.
