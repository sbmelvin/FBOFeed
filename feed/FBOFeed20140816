<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service in Miami, FL., intends to award a purchase order to Think Tank Incorporated, Silver Spring, MD. One of the most valuable assets of NOAA is the data collected by the agency, specifically for the National Marine Fisheries Service. The data collected on landings catch and effort, and length and age composition are some of the most essential data for use in stock assessment and management of fisheries. For staff at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, data from these sources comprise the majority of the data requested through the Fisheries Statistics Division. Most of the data compiled in the past was to meet requests by councils, regional office staff, or other science center staff for inclusion in stock assessments. However, now, requests from the general public and academia have been on the increase. These increases in data requests from outside the agency have taxed the resources available to compile these data sets, many of which could be satisfied by a making this data available to the public through a web based tool. The difficulty in releasing data to the general public is that although man venues are available for retrieving the data, not all agencies roll-up the data to mask confidentiality in the same way which creates conflicting reports from different data outlets. The decisions that some sources have made, concerning which strata to produce, limits the ability of other agencies to produce data in the strata deemed necessary. This is most apparent in the SE where the SEFSC cannot release regional landings because NMFS S&amp;T have already posted landings by state on the S&amp;T web query site. This makes it difficult to present regional information to the SAFMC without revealing confidential data for GA. Having a standard method to roll-up on the east coast would benefit all partners producing publicly available data from east coast fisheries.<br />It is imperative to the data quality program in the Southeast and for continuity in the national FIS program that Think Tank provides the services requested by the SEFSC. The refinement of the Confidentiality Rollup and the continued development data quality programs are crucial to every aspect of fisheries management in the southeast region. Any delay in the data quality program will result in subsequent delays in meeting regulatory requirements. Think Tank has the knowledge of the SEFSC databases gained during development of the HMS rewrite of logbook systems are essential in further enhancing the confidentiality rollup across most fishery dependent databases at SEFSC. Using Think Tank for this requirement offers the Government the best value for the funds allocated to the Southeast region, it also leverages NMFS' investment in time and expertise in other regions as well. The SEFSC estimates it would take 3 months for another contractor to learn the intricacies of the SEFSC two logbook databases, multiple observer databases, landings databases, and two dockside interview programs. SEFSC estimates it would require another 1-2 months to develop expertise with the ACCSP warehouse and the GulfFIN warehouse and associated datasets. This would require a SEFSC staff time to train a new contractor for 3-5 months. This would equate to a substantial increase in salaries to retrain a new contractor. This does not include the time lost from development, which would set project delivery back by at least the amount of time required to train a new contractor. The SEFSC would have to develop alternate data quality procedures, which will involve a greater amount of staff time and loss productivity. This will impact the ability of the SEFSC to make data available for producing management advice, which may affect the timeliness of fishery management actions.<br />

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA) and Atmospheric and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, FL is seeking support to cover the use of a Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) on NOAA's P3 (N42) to make observations of the wind fields near and within tropical cyclones (TCs). These wind fields will be used to improve the governments understanding of the role of shear and Large Eddy Circulations (LEC) in TC track and intensity forecasts. In particular, the P3DWL data will be used by AOML to validate Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) analyses and forecasts of TC evolution. This application of the DWL data is critical to other AOML research related to the evaluation of future space-based DWL impacts on TC forecasting using OSSEs.<br />This work requires interaction with Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atlantic Oceanographic and Metrological Laboratory (AOML) which houses the Hurricane Research Division (HRD).
<p>Task requirements are:<br />1.Provide technical support for NOAA Aircraft Operational Center (AOC) for installation of the DWL. Timing will be discussed with Government Contact Point (GCP).<br />2.Provide training to the scientists of NOAA/AOML/HRD for operationally operating the DWL on the P3 aircraft. The P3 DWL flights are scheduled for August through November of 2014. If the option years are exercised the flight scheduled will be provided to the contractor.<br />3.Process the DWL raw data and deliver quality-controlled wind profiles to HRD scientists after the hurricane season.</p>
<p>This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 541990. Size standard not to exceed $15M. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Part 12 Commercial Items.

Statement of Need <br />The COMSOL Multiphysics package will be used to model charge carrier transport within semiconductor x-ray detectors allowing complete image modeling to simulate imaging properties of novel radiation imagers based on CdTe and CdZnTe. These new detector modes are used in emerging photon-counting imaging systems and have the potential for reducing radiation dose to the patient while maintaining high image quality. With the addition of this simulation package, the electronic noise of novel detector designs will be modeled and incorporated in the complete simulation of imaging systems, part of an effort by DIAM scientists to develop approaches for virtual clinical trials which are least-burdensome in the area of medical imaging products.
