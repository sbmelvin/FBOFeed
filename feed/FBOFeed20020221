<DESC>This acquisition is for a FIRM-FIXED PRICE, INDEFINITE-DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ), ENVIRONMENTAL MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACT (EMAC) FOR REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT VARIOUS SITES ON NAVY AND MARINE CORPS INSTALLATIONS AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN CA, AZ, NV and NM. Although the work associated with this contract may take place in various States, the Government expects most of the work to be performed in Southern California.  This procurement is reserved for competition in the Section 8(a) program pursuant to the Small Business Act.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services.  Responding 8(a) firms must have NAICS Code 562910 among their approved codes.  EFD Southwest intends to award two or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity 8(A) contracts, however, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract as a result of this solicitation if at least two (2) qualifying proposals are not received.  Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business 8(a) firm(s) whose proposal(s) conform to the solicitation and offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award one contract on proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government does, however, reserve the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $20,000,000.  The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards.  Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).  Most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in Southern California.  Typical work that may be performed under the resulting contract(s) includes: environmental remedial actions; removal actions; remedial design; expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies; remedial action systems operation and maintenance; and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable conditions. Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air and/or bio sparging, reactive walls, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, capped aquatic environments, storm water systems, and free product recovery.
 The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL). The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, marine sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, shorelines, fire fighting training areas, housing areas, and other facilities. 
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance within the past three (3) years, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience within the past five (5) years, Factor 3 - Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include proposed Task Order 0001), and Factor 4 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001).  Factors 1 ? Past Performance, 2 ? Specialized Experience, and 3 ? Engineering and Management Approach are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 4 ? Price is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3, when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of technical superiority to the government.
Offerors shall submit proposals via electronic format on CD-ROM Disks.  The acceptable electronic formats for proposals include Word (98 - 00), Excel (98 - 00), or Adobe Acrobat (3.0 or 4.0) (.pdf).  Electronic mail is not an acceptable format.  Offerors shall ensure that proposal disks are virus free, and free of password protection.  If access to proposal data is prohibited due to viruses, passwords, or wrong format, the offeror may be considered unacceptable.  Paper proposals will not be accepted. 
A pre-proposal conference will be held in conjunction with the site visit for the proposed Task Order 0001.  Offerors are required to participate in the conference/site visit.  The date and time of the pre-proposal conference and site visit have not yet been determined.  Offerors participating in the pre-proposal conference and site visit shall fax information about the attendees (requirements will be conveyed at a later date), on company letterhead at a date to be announced. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than offeror(s) submitting the lowest total price(s) for proposed Task Order 0001; to limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals, and to award to the offeror(s) submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be most advantageous to the Government. Offeror's are advised that an award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted that initially offer the most favorable terms.  Offeror(s) should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal(s).  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal conference/site visit or responding to the solicitation will not be compensated.  The solicitation will be available only by electronic media and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under pre-solicitation notice N68711-01-R-6013.  In the event that electronic files for proposed Task 0001 are too large to post on the electronic solicitation (esol) website, these files will be available through plan rooms identified on the esol website.  Prospective offerors must register on the web site.  There will be no paper copies of this solicitation issued.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.

The Library of Congress intends to issue an open-season solicitation, RFP# S-LC02015, for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program.  This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non-serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices.  The services of serials subscription agents is covered under a separate LC/FEDLINK solicitation and is not the subject of this solicitation.  The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1 - Firm Order Services; LOT 2 - Approval Plan Services; LOT 3 - Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4 - Technical and/or Order Processing Services.   VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER LOT 2, LOT 3, OR LOT 4.  LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation.   LOT 1 -- Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one-time order for a specific title (or specific titles) in any format and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.  Under LOT 2, -- Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.  The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.  In LOT 3, -- Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them, and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over.  In LOT 4 -- Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf-ready condition.   Multiple awards are anticipated.  The solicitation, RFP# S-LC02015, will be available for downloading on or about February 28, 2002.  For information on the Library of Congress' FEDLINK program, please visit our website:  www.loc.gov/flicc.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of a fill valve and a vent valve for the XRS instrument.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 15 March 2002, the Global Grid Product Area Directorate, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, MA anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Theater Deployable Communications (TDC) Integrated Communications Access Packages (ICAP) follow-on effort.  The objectives of the ICAP follow-on effort are two-fold:  (1) to acquire and deliver equipment (modules and kits) to new units in the field in accordance with the TDC Fielding and Priority List and (2) to refresh the fielded modules/kits as required to maintain a consistent technical and operational baseline. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: a.  Establish a new technical baseline (block "x") annually by completing the non-recurring engineering through successful testing of the first unit on all new versions of ICAP modules and kits.  This includes conducting a familiarization session on the new modules and kits at both the ICAP schoolhouse at Keesler AFB, MS and the TDC depot at Robins AFB, GA. b.  Assemble and/or manufacture ICAP modules and kits at the latest baseline and ship to new units on the TDC Fielding and Priority list. c.  Upgrade fielded ICAP modules and kits through either retrofit or replacement to maintain a fielded baseline of not more than two versions of any module or kit.  In addition, under special operationally driven circumstances, there may be a requirement to maintain only one fielded version of a particular module or kit.  The Government will specify these situations as part of defining each block baseline. Detailed requirements will be identified in the RFP. This is a FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, procurement.  The required equipment has been divided into four separate categories:  voice, data, muxing, and transmission.  Offerors may propose to provide equipment under one, any combination of, or all of the categories.  However, offerors must propose to provide ALL the modules and kits associated with each category proposed.  Failure to do so will result in a proposal being considered non-responsive for that category. This acquisition will be executed on a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract basis.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each individual order placed, in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). The Government also reserves the right to make award without discussions for any of the equipment categories covered by this RFP. Each awarded contract will include five Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for each of the equipment categories:  non-recurring engineering, modules and kits, retrofit kits, spares, and data.  All CLINs except data will be priced on a firm-fixed-price basis; data CLINs will Not be Separately Priced (NSP).  The Government will award the appropriate groups of CLINs to the successful offeror(s) in each category. The duration of the anticipated basic ordering period is from award through 30 Sep 02, with four (4) additional 12 month ordering periods. This solicitation will be made available on the Internet at the Hanscom Air Force Base Electronic Request for Proposals Bulletin Board (HERBB) website:  http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp by selecting the link Theater Deployable Communications Integrated Communications Access Packages.   Proposals will be submitted in multiple parts (split submission).  The first submission will be the Past Performance Volume, due 15 days after RFP release.  The Mission Capability and Contracting Volumes will be submitted 30 days after the RFP is issued.  The Government will then conduct a Plant Visit at each offeror's plant (actual location(s) where modules will be fabricated).  The complete proposal, consisting of the Price Volume, will be requested and due approximately 14 days after the last plant visit.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. An Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman's role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection.  ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Col Joseph Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff; ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106; or email at joseph.maryeski@hanscom.af.mil.  Contact Cathy Mirra at (781) 377-6317 or cathy.mirra@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Major Chris Harrington, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure services on a sole source basis from Cygnus Corporation, Rockville, Maryland.  NLM requires the continued services of Cygnus Corporation to acquire and add chemical structure and other data to the NLM ChemIDplus Database.  Cygnus lead personnel have over 6 years experience with MDL ISIS and ChemScape software, over two years supporting the NLM ChemIDplus database, and over 6 years with the chemical information and literature scanning part of the anti-HIV program at NIAID.  Cygnus personnel have had previous experience in this product and the software used to support it. Cygnus personnel also have experience in the NIAID chemical biological systems, including HIV/AIDS data of interest to NLM. Cygnus has previously doubled the number of chemical structures in ChemIDplus, as well as provided quality control on the data previously added. SIS needs upgrades to handle the more complex user chemical structure query capabilities that are planned by SIS. Cygnus has a combination of Chemical Structure and Biomedical Information and Chemscape, ISISHost, ISISDirect, Oracle, and Unix/NT expertise that is not available in the other SIS contractors, and continuation will allow this work to be done collaboratively in an expeditious manner to enhance the public ChemIDplus System. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.

Title: BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN STRESS PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOMEDICAL STRATEGIES TO PROTECT NAVY AND MARINE CORPS FORCES 
 
Synopsis:

(1) General Statement of Research Need
The Office of Naval Research (ONR 341) is soliciting preproposals and proposals in the following topic areas within the Medical Discovery and Invention program.  This program includes basic research and applied research components.

The basic research component supports state-of-the art efforts in molecular physiology, a broad category allowing work founded on multiple biomedical disciplines and tools (e.g., immunology, neurobiology, genetics, pharmacology, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, genomics & proteomics).  The goal is to provide a fundamental science base yielding information potentially applicable to diverse military problems.  

The basic research component has a main interest in the area of stress physiology, i.e., basic studies to elucidate the environmental, genetic, physiological and biochemical mechanisms that underlie cellular and organismic resilience to psychological and physiological stress.  A key aspect of interest is research to elucidate basic mechanisms that underlie the manifestation of individual differences in stress resilience.  Program interests include identification of genes and gene products impacting biological functions important to optimal warfighter performance.  Examples include: genes conferring resistance to sleep deprivation, genes in the brain altered by exposure to hot or cold environments, and genes and gene products changed by exposure to electromagnetic radiation.  In addition, research to develop the next generation physiological and cognition enhancers using manipulation of specific genes is requested.

The technical point of contact (POC) for this component is CDR Steve Ahlers, 703-696-0367, E-mail ahlerss@onr.navy.mil.

The applied research component draws on multiple science disciplines and diverse information sources to develop guidelines, methods to predict damage to biological systems, therapeutics, and other strategies to enhance the protection of Navy and Marine Corps forces from stressors in the military operational environment.   

Application areas of specific interest include: (note: some work may qualify as basic research, depending on the design of individual proposals.) 

A. Undersea Medicine. The goal of this application area is to elucidate the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that underlie the effects of stressors experienced by Navy and Marine Corps divers and Navy submarine personnel.  Research proposals in the following areas are requested: 1) studies into the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE) with an emphasis on characterizing a) immune system interactions with nitrogen gas emboli, b) how the immune system influences DCS/AGE risk, c) methods to improve prediction and diagnosis of DCS/AGE using non-invasive imaging techniques and predictive biochemical markers, d) improved therapeutic (non-recompressive) interventions to mitigate DCS and AGE, e) novel methods to remove excess nitrogen from biological tissues and f) greater understanding of how exposure to thermal stress can influence DCS risk; 2) studies to elucidate the pathology of hyperbaric oxygen toxicity (HBO) to include: a) biochemical mechanisms which sense molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen species, b) the biochemical and/or pathophysiological consequences of exposure to molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen species which result from exposure to hyperbaric oxygen, c) studies to develop prophylactic therapeutics for central nervous system and pulmonary HBO toxicity and d) methods to detect in real time the development of oxidative injury in situ;  3) studies to elucidate the basic physiological mechanisms which underlie high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) as well as the assessment of novel compounds to protect against HPNS; 4) studies to elucidate the acute effects of heat and cold stress on performance as well as the physiological adaptive mechanisms to heat and cold stress for improving divers' ability to operate in thermal extremes; 5) the effects of high and low frequency sound on human divers; and 6) the identification and mitigation of operational stressors experienced by submariners including technologies to improve operator performance in submarines in the littoral battle space and to improve the survival of submariners during submarine rescue operations.   

The technical POC for this component is CDR Steve Ahlers, 703-696-0367, E-mail: ahlerss@onr.navy.mil.

B.  Operational Biological Effects. The goal of this application area is to better understand and model damage to biological systems caused by military operational exposures, provide design guidelines for less hazardous systems, and develop better approaches for protecting the health and safety of Naval personnel.  Research proposals are requested in: 1) elucidating the nature of biological effects, especially in the brain and endocrine organs, resulting from exposure to electromagnetic radiation, both pulsed and continuous wave, and high power electric fields; 2) exploring short- and long-term effects of acute and chronic exposure to low pressure environments where 95% or greater oxygen breathing is required (e.g., high altitude tactical aircraft and high-altitude training chambers); 3) elucidating damage and healing mechanisms within the inner ear resulting from exposure to high noise levels (intermittent and continuous) and exploring new approaches to treatment based on these endogenous mechanisms; 4) understanding biological effects in the brain and endocrine organs activated by different electromagnetic radiation frequencies of importance to the Navy.

The technical (POC) for this component is LCDR Dave Street, 703-696-4502, E-mail: streetd@onr.navy.mil.

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities; investigators should be able to demonstrate the required research capability and the necessary facilities.  Preproposals and proposals whose main objectives are to conduct analyses, literature reviews, or program evaluations are not encouraged.

(2) Available Funding and Expected Award Instruments
ONR anticipates that basic research (6.1) and applied research (6.2) funding will be available to make awards.  Awards will primarily be in the form of grants (Universities) and cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to award cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements to appropriate parties, should the situation warrant use of an instrument other than a grant or contract.  

(3) Instructions for Preparation of Preproposals 
Offerors are invited to submit five (5) copies of a preproposal formatted as described on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/.  The preproposal (technical only) should not exceed three pages of text.  In addition, an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for a three year effort and a curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) (PI) should be appended together with the three-page technical preproposal along with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the preproposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising preproposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their preproposal submission.  However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its preproposal was not identified as promising or if no preproposal is submitted; however, any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  The initial deadline for preproposals will be 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 21 March 2002 for the next funding cycle that begins 1 October 2002.  

(4) Instructions for Preparation of Proposals
Formal proposals prepared in accordance with the Research Proposal Format Instructions as described on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/ will be required by 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 3 June 2002.  Please note that special information is needed when experiments will be performed using animals, human subjects, or recombinant DNA.  When animals will be employed, a completed DoD Animal Use Protocol with supporting documentation (copies of AAALAC approval, IACUC approval, research literature searches, and the two most recent USDA inspection reports) must be submitted with the proposal.  Similarly, any proposal that involves the use of human subjects must include copies of the approval by the organization's committee for the protection of human subjects (Institutional Review Board, IRB); documentation of the organization's Multiple Project Assurance, Federal Wide Assurance, or DoD Single Project Assurance that covers the proposed human subjects study; and copies of the human use Consent Form.  Proposals using recombinant DNA must include documentation of compliance with DHHS recombinant DNA regulations, approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and copies of the DHHS Approval of the IBC letter.  Please carefully review section "N" of the Research Proposal Format Instructions for further details and forms.

The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement.  The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less.  A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses.

Title: MEDICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN CASUALTY CARE AND MANAGEMENT

Synopsis:

(1) General Statement of Research Need
The Office of Naval Research (ONR 341) is soliciting preproposals and proposals directed at basic, applied and advanced development aspects of medical research focusing on combat casualty care, particularly the treatment of major blood loss, combined blood loss and head trauma, blast injury and traumatic shock.  Of specific interest are novel approaches to acute pain control; methods for inducing metabolic down-regulation; models and therapeutic approaches to blast injury; methods for achieving hemostasis of large wounds; oxygen-carrying materials that substitute for red cells and are stable when stored under ambient temperature conditions.  Especially meritorious submissions pertaining to hemorrhagic shock mechanisms and therapeutics and non-invasive diagnostic devices suitable for use in the field may be considered.  The goals of the ONR Casualty Care and Management program are presented in more detail on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/ and below.

The following aspects of acute trauma care are of particular interest: (1) products that control pain without cognitive and motor impairment; (2) novel approaches to metabolic down-regulation that facilitate casualty transport; and (3) treatments for physiological and sequelae of induced whole-body hypothermia or torpor.  With respect to hemostasis and oxygen delivery, products with the following capabilities are sought: (4) hemostatic agents or devices that are affordable and capable of achieving hemostasis of large extremity and soft tissue wounds; (5) lyophilized red cells or other oxygen carriers that can be stored long-term with minimal refrigeration; (6) red cell substitutes free of vasoactivity and immunosuppressant activity that function without exogenous oxygen support. With respect to hemorrhagic shock, the following areas may be explored: (7) mechanisms of the shock response to trauma, especially neural, neuroendocrine, endocrine or immune mediators stimulated by hemorrhagic shock; (9) mechanisms of cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion; (10) novel therapeutic interventions for shock; (11) design and development of a predictive preclinical model of hemorrhagic shock with or without head injury; (12) drug substitutes for large volume fluids that maintain cardiovascular function or additives for conventional resuscitation fluids that reduce volume requirements; and (13) improved delivery of fluids to hypotensive casualties. With respect to non-invasive diagnostics, (14) lightweight, portable technologies for enhanced diagnosis of injuries in the combat casualty by minimally trained personnel are desired.  In addition to the above areas, any novel approaches that may save lives on the battlefield or maintain functionality of the casualty will be considered, especially those that identify risk, protract or mitigate adverse sequelae, or enable mission completion without medical consequence.  Techniques and technologies suitable for use by first responders or limited license practitioners are a priority.  Decision support system integration into diagnostic and therapeutic technologies is important.  Further information is available from the Technical POC: Dr. J. Majde-Cottrell,703-696-4055, E-mail: majdej@onr.navy.mil.

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities; investigators should be able to demonstrate the required research capability and the necessary facilities.  Preproposals whose main objectives are to conduct analyses, literature reviews, or program evaluations are not encouraged.
 

(2) Available Funding and Expected Award Instruments
ONR anticipates that basic research (6.1), applied research (6.2) and development (6.3) funding will be available to make awards.  Awards will primarily be in the form of grants (Universities) and cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to award cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements to appropriate parties, should the situation warrant use of an instrument other than a grant or a contract.

(3) Instructions for Preparation of Preproposals 
Offerors are invited to submit five (5) copies of a preproposal formatted as described on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/.  The preproposal (technical only) should not exceed three pages of text.  In addition, an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for a three year effort and a curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) (PI) should be appended together with the three-page technical preproposal along with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the preproposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising preproposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their preproposal submission.  However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its preproposal was not identified as promising or if no preproposal is submitted; however, any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  The initial deadline for preproposals will be 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 21 March 2002 for the next funding cycle that begins 1 October 2002.  

(4) Instructions for Preparation of Proposals
Formal proposals prepared in accordance with the Research Proposal Format Instructions as described on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/ will be required by 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 3 June 2002.  Please note that special information is needed when experiments will be performed using animals, human subjects, or recombinant DNA.  When animals will be employed, a completed DoD Animal Use Protocol with supporting documentation (copies of AAALAC approval, IACUC approval, research literature searches, and the two most recent USDA inspection reports) must be submitted with the proposal.  Similarly, any proposal that involves the use of human subjects must include copies of the approval by the organization's committee for the protection of human subjects (Institutional Review Board, IRB); documentation of the organization's Multiple Project Assurance, Federal Wide Assurance, or DoD Single Project Assurance that covers the proposed human subjects study; and copies of the human use Consent Form.  Proposals using recombinant DNA must include documentation of compliance with DHHS recombinant DNA regulations, approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and copies of the DHHS Approval of the IBC letter.  Please carefully review section "N" of the Research Proposal Format Instructions for further details and forms.

The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement.  The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less.  A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses.  Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

Offerors must state in their preproposals and full proposals that the submission is in response to BAA 02-008.  Preproposals received after 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 21 March 2002, or proposals received after 1600 hours Washington Local Time, 3 June 2002, may still be considered for the next funding cycle if funds are available.  This BAA provides no funding for preproposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All preproposals will be acknowledged within two weeks after submission.  Preproposals and proposals will not be returned after evaluation.  

(5)  Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation
The evaluation of proposals will be performed by government technical experts from the Office of Naval Research and possibly other Federal entities.  The Government may use selected non-government personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative functions of any preproposals and proposals ensuing from this solicitation.  Such non-government personnel will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.

The evaluations of preproposals and full proposals will be conducted using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance: 1) overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; 2) programmatic relevance of the proposal; 3) the qualifications and experience of the proposed principal investigator and key personnel; 4) the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 5) realism of the proposed cost and extent to which the cost effectiveness of the proposed research is diminished by expenditures for excessive administrative and overhead expenses; and 6) socio-economic merits (for procurement contracts only).

<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>NA The US Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center Washington, on behalf of the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate  Humanitarian Demining Office proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis  with Golden West Humani tarian Foundation, Sherman Oaks, CA, a contract for development of a dispensed explosive foam powerful enough to neutralize all surface buried, conventional blast landmines regardless of configuration or casing material in demining operations.  The propose d acquisition is based on Golden West Humanitarian Foundation's existing hand-held, two-component High- Performance Hand-Held Foamed Nitromethane System that has proven to be simple, low-cost, reliable, safe and non-toxic, and is directed to meet the prima ry requirement that the dispensed explosive foam be powerful enough to neutralize all conventional blast landmines regardless of configuration or casing material.  The system will retain the hand-held two-component use of the latest available component par ts for the greatest reliability. The transfer of propellant into the stock solution container should occur in one quick operation. The flow-rate must allow the mixed contents to be dispensed more quickly, smoothly, consistently and easily with only moderat e finger pressure on the finger pad. The system must be applicable to a wide temperature range. Explosive performance must remain more than 30 minutes after it is dispersed. The kit storage life is to be increased to the maximum duration possible. The cont ractor shall deliver 800 pre-production kits to the Government for evaluation.  Performance will be completed within nine (9) months after contract award.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1).  All request s for further information must be in writing or via email to richard.bonney@cacw.army.mil.  SEE Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 9241   27 - 28 FEB 2002. The Air Pollution Control Technology Verification Center (APCTVC) is now forming tow new Technical Panels (TPs) related to mobile diesel engines. The two TPs - (1) fuels, fuel additives, and alternative fuels; and (2) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) control devices - will provide guidance and direction to the APCTVC in developing generic verification protocols for verifying the performance of these types of controls in reducing emissions from mobile diesel engines. You are invited to serve on either or both TPs as best serves your  organization's needs. These new TPs will meet on Wednesday, February 27 and Thursday, February 28, 2002 at the Crystal Gateway Marriott (http://Marriotthotels.com/WASGW/default.asp), 1700 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington VA 22202. Draft documents will be available, via links to .pdf files on the ETV  website, at least a week prior to the meetings. The agenda for February 27 is fuels, fuel additives, and alternative fuels; the TP will meet from 8:30am to 12:00noon, break for lunch, then reconvene from 1:00 to 4:00pm.  The agenda for February 28 is SCR; the TP will convene from 8:30am to  12:00noon. The hotel is within walking distance of the Crystal City Metro station (Blue/Yellow Lines). Attendees arriving by train into Union Station should take the Red Line to Gallery Place/Chinatown and transfer to the Yellow Line to Huntington. Complimentary shuttle service to/from Reagan  Washington National Airport (DCA) is also available. Guests should call the hotel upon arrival at the airport to initiate hotel shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. Guests must make their own room reservations by calling Crystal Gateway Marriott (telephone 703 920 3230); be sure to state  "ETV meeting hosted by RTI". Rooms are available but a block has not been reserved. The goal of these two TPs will be the same as that of the DEC/PM Filters/Engine Mods Technical Panel on which many on you served over the past year; namely, to provide assistance in drafting protocols for fuels and  SCR technologies. Oversight of the VRP for both technologies now resides with EPA/OTAQ Washington, with Carl Wick leading for fuels and Cliff Dean leading for SCR. The plan is to build on the recently completed draft of the DEC/PM Filters/Engine Mods protocol, making only those modifications  necessary to properly verify fuels and SCR technologies. Thus, we do not anticipate as extended a process and are targeting completion by July 1, 2002. A day and a half has been allocated because it is the first meeting and we feel that much time might be required. Follow-up meetings will be  scheduled on the same day for the convenience of those who are involved with both - one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Given that most of the protocol has already been written, this should be enough time. The draft of the DEC, particulate traps, and engine control devices protocol remains  on the Web for downloading at: http://etv.rti.org/apct/tech/mobile/GVP_MS_Rev07_Devices.pdf. Please advise Jenni Elion at (919) 541-6253 (jme@rti.org) regarding: (1) your interest in attending one or both sessions (we need a count); (2) whether you would like to remain on the distribution list for  either or both technology areas; (3) any questions or comments regarding schedule or content; (4) contact information updates if changes have occurred in the past six months or so. Point of Contact is Jenni M. Elion, Research Environmental Engineer, CET/412 Building 11, RTI, P.O. Box 12194 (3040  Cornwallis Rd), Research Triangle Park NC 27709-2194, T: (919) 541-6253; F: (919) 541-6936. Please visit the website at http://scp.rti.org/.

<DESC>The work includes four (4) indefinite quantity contracts for miscellaneous design and engineering services for underwater facility assessments of Government waterfront facilities at various locations, worldwide.  The general intention is for the contractor to provide design and engineering services that will be described and procured through appropriate task orders for each contract.  The government intends to set aside two of the four contracts for Small Business.  Two of the four contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.
Underwater assessment includes, but is not limited to, underwater inspection; engineering analysis of existing conditions in comparison to design requirements, previous inspection reports and/or drawings of the facilities; engineering calculations for structural analysis with or without previous design calculations; documentation of findings; and recommendations with cost estimates for follow-on actions.  All underwater assessments will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers.  For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC).  That EIC shall supervise the diving, dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.  The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report.  The EIC shall ensure that all diving is performed in accordance with OSHA standards.  US citizenship is required for access to inspection sites.
Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings and SPECSINTACT specifications; bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; engineering report review; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; engineering calculations; static and dynamic structural and using computer modeling; three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including analysis of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes; water tank inspections in accordance with applicable standards of the American Waterworks Association and NAVFAC MO-210.9; and FHWA certified bridge inspections using NBIS standards for overland and over water bridges.   
A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.  This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations.  Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, potable water storage tanks, dams, water control structures; instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, bridges, underwater cables, or any similar structure.
The duration of the contracts will be for a period of one base year, with the possibility of two option years.  The guaranteed minimum amount under each contract shall be $20,000 for the base year only.  The estimated total amount contracted for each contract shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.    The selected firms for these contracts will be required to provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal for each task order.  Each task order will be fixed price. 

SF 254 and SF 255 provided for consideration should not exceed 20 pages total.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to FACCO_PROPOSALS@nfesc.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that proposals are received at the above site.  Submittals are due no later than 2:30 P.M. EST, March 26, 2002.
 
Firms that wish to be considered for this project will be evaluated upon the following criteria.  Criteria numbers one and two are of equal importance and the other criteria are shown in descending order of importance after criteria one and two.
 
1.  Professional qualifications and technical competence of the team proposed for this project in the type of work required.  Professional qualifications include professional registrations of the design personnel assigned to the project.  Qualifications for all diving personnel include the ability to meet OSHA safety standards and dive industry standards.  As well as professional qualifications for design personnel, diving team members will be evaluated upon certifications earned that are generally accepted certifications for the diving industry.
 
2.  Specialized experience in the type of work required.  This criteria includes experience in the following areas:  a.  Design and engineering services for repairs of waterfront structures using destructive and non-destructive (NDT) techniques.  b.  Static and dynamic structural analyses, including seismic vulnerability assessments and vessel/structure interaction analyses of waterfront facilities using computer tools.  Evaluation of both impressed current and sacrificial anode type cathodic protection systems on submerged structures.  c.  Experience with and capability to provide engineering submittals in electronic format(s).  (Submittals will include, but are not limited to:  contract bid documents, web-enabled multimedia inspection reports, three dimensional models and renderings.)
 
3.  Capacity of the firm to perform the work in the required time period.  Capacity includes the firm?s ability to perform multiple tasks concurrently in the required timeframe.  Condition assessment reports will be required with 60 to 120 days after completion of the field inspection, depending upon the number and size of the facilities inspected.
 
4.  Quality control and safety assurance procedures for underwater inspections, report preparation, structural assessments and design services.  A copy of firms? safe diving practices manuals, or diving operations manuals is required for review (the manual will not be returned.)
 
5.  Past performance on projects of similar size and scope.
In addition to the above criteria, the following considerations will be used in the case that firms are found to be equally qualified.  It is the intent of the Department of Navy to award these contracts to firms that are the most highly technically qualified and these considerations will only be used in the case of equally technically qualified firms.
a.  Volume of work awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 month with the idea of sharing the wealth of DoD contract dollars among highly qualified firms.
b.  Superior performance on past contracts.  This may be demonstrated by providing copies o design awards, excellent performance evaluations, letters of recognition, etc.
c.  Commitments that firms are willing to make to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, etc., in subcontracting possibilities.

SUBJECT:	Market Research Information Request - T-38 Wheel & Brake Upgrade


This Market Research Information Request (RFI) is being sent in advance of an anticipated open distribution Request for Proposal (RFP).  In developing your response you are reminded that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

The demand for the T-38 wheel and brake upgrade is driven by the need to improve the reliability, wear life, performance and safety of the existing T-38 brake, also to improve the reliability of the existing wheel and incorporate radial tire technology. The demand for this upgrade will as well support anticipated weapon system gross weight increases.  

The T-38 fleet is expected to remain in service until the year 2024.  There are currently (585) airplanes in active service in the United States (USAF, NASA, and Navy).  An estimated 1,521 brakes and 1800 wheels will be required for initial provisioning and spares.

Information provided by respondents will help ensure that an RFP is prepared with satisfactory information.  Preliminary wheel and brake requirements are provided in this RFI as guidelines.  

REQUESTED INFORMATION

1)	Please provide a description of wheel and brake upgrade concept(s) that would meet the preliminary requirements. The Air Force will consider all proposed concepts prior to establishing the program direction of any future T-38 wheel and brake upgrade program.  Please provide concept layout drawings that highlight key features, and include a summary of the impact of the proposed design on related systems (i.e., hydraulics, addition of anti-skid, etc.).
2)	A radial tire option will be available for the T-38 in the near future.  Please comment on the advantages and disadvantages to qualifying a wheel for use with both tire types?
3)	Please provide an estimated dry weight (new and worn) for an upgraded wheel and brake.
4)	Please provide the estimated brake wear life and time (cycles) between wheel overhauls.
5)	For how many years should a brake be designed to remain on an airplane axle before corrosion, hydraulic leaks, oxidation, etc., become problems?
6)	Please provide a top-level program schedule that highlights major program milestones between program launch and flight test equipment delivery.  The objective is to provide information that will identify development phases and deliverables, and will provide a general understanding of the amount of time required for development of the equipment.  Where necessary please state assumptions.  For example, assumed qualification test requirements should be stated in support of a schedule estimate.
7)	In terms of production capacity, please identify and discuss what should be assumed as a reasonable amount of time to retrofit the fleet with an upgraded wheel and brake.  From a supplier perspective, please identify issues and problems related to a fleet retrofit with the best ways to resolve or mitigate those issues and problems.  From a supplier perspective, please provide advantages and disadvantages of a time compliant retrofit in comparison to a retrofit by attrition.
8)	Please estimate the following for the T-38 wheel and brake upgrade:
-	Number of Full Stop Landings to achieve a 100% worn brake-	Landings per wheel-	Maximum number of wheel overhauls-	Years to develop & qualify new wheel and brake-	Years to retrofit fleet-	Development costs-	MLG wheel cost (initial provisioning)-	MLG wheel cost (after initial provisioning)-	Brake assembly cost (initial provisioning)-	Brake assembly cost (after initial provisioning)-	Heat sink cost (after initial provisioning)-	Man-hours to build up wheel/tire assembly and install wheel and brake -	Additional heat sink mass required to complete 100% worn brake RTO atthe brake energy, inertia, and decel rate described below.
9)	What other critical program issues/problems would you anticipate and what could be done to address them?

Applicants to the FY02 Health Disparity Training and Health Disparity Research mechanisms must explicitly express how the proposed research is related to the disparate burden of Prostate Cancer among African Am ericans.  Failure to do so may be grounds for administrative withdrawal of the proposal without further review.

The written response will be forwarded to programmatic review along with the summary statement for consideration during the second tier of review.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  RESTRICTED TO 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII.  The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program.  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Office.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to a chosen few contractors for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer.  The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.  The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).

The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated.  Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation.  SOLICITATIONS:  The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal.  Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.  ORDERS:  Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.  Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.  LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Provide 8(a) Certification.  (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<SUBJECT>Meeting Announcement--Recreation One-Stop
<DESC>The Department of the Interior shall have a meeting to discuss partnership opportunities in developing the Recreation One-Stop initiative, Thursday, March 7, 2002.   Demonstrations/Open House: 12 Noon to 1:00 p.m.; Meeting: 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.; Location: South Interior Building Auditorium, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20240 (Picture ID required for entrance).  Recreation.gov (www.recreation .gov) is an Internet portal providing one-stop access to federal recreation information.  The service, which is hosted by the Department of the Interior, is a partnership among the Federal natural resources agencies.  The Administration's E-Government task force recently selected Recreation.gov as one of 25 government-wide Internet projects intended to expand and improve on-line access to government information and services.  The new enhanced Recreation One-Stop service will expand the existing Recreation.gov website and offer comprehensive recreation planning information, allowing users to locate Federal and State recreational areas on-line, generate on-line maps and make reservations for campgrounds and other services. The Department of the Interior and its partner agencies seek to build this new recreation information service through innovative new partnerships with public, private and non-profit partners.  The purpose of this meeting is to provide the public and our stakeholders with more information about the Recreation One-Stop project and explore opportunities for innovative partnerships. Areas of discussion include the following: Content: What types of information and services should be featured in this new system?  What sort of information on private sector services is appropriate to provide?; Technology:  What are the appropriate technologies and tools to use in developing this service?  How can we best involve the private sector?; Ownership:  How can we create a Federal-State/Public-Private partnership? What is the appropriate structure or mechanism?  May the Federal Government appropriately spin-off the One-Stop to a non-government entity?  This is a public meeting open to anyone interested in learning more about the Recreation One-Stop project and opportunities for partnerships.  For more information, please contact the Department of the Interior, Office of Planning and Performance Management, John Mahoney or Norma Campbell at 202-208-1818.  If you plan to attend, please RSVP by February 28, 2002, at 202-208-1818.  Please let us know if you have special needs.    Website Demonstration/Open House: The meeting will be preceded by demonstrations of Recreation.gov and other recreation-related products and services.  There is limited space available to display recreation-related products and services during the open house.  Display space is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
