<DESC><strong>NOTE - the final NAICS Codes for TMAS 2 have not yet been determined; thus, four (4) separate FBO announcements are being publicized for the possible OASIS TMAS 2 Pools and their associated NAICS Codes. The potential Pools are Pool 3 (NAICS 541330 Exception A), Pool 5A (NAICS 541715 Exception B), Pool 5B (NAICS 541715 Exception C), and Pool 6 (NAICS 541715 Exception A). Once the NAICS determinations are made, an update will be posted on FBO to notify all interested parties of the OASIS SB Pools under which TMAS 2 will be awarded.</strong>
<p>The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is in the preliminary stages of Acquisition Planning for the follow-on Technical Management Advisory Services (TMAS) contract, known as TMAS 2. The existing TMAS contracts were awarded as multiple task orders under General Services Agency's (GSA's) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services (OASIS) Small Business (SB) multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. AFTC intends to utilize GSA OASIS SB for TMAS 2. To keep Industry up to date on TMAS 2 and provide an overview of AFTC's mission, we will conduct an Industry Day on 14 August 2018 from 0800-1700 CDT at the Emerald Coast Convention Center, 1250 Miracle Strip Pkwy SE, Fort Walton Beach FL, 32548. In addition, the TMAS 2 Team will conduct one-on-one sessions on 15 August 2018 at the same location.<br /><br />Companies interested in attending this Industry Day must submit a Visit Request, via email (with the Subject Line, "TMAS 2 Industry Day), to Ms. Kionna Starks, kionna.starks@us.af.mil <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> Mr. Sean Capik, sean.capik@eglin.af.mil. Email requests are due by close of business 7 August 2018. Visit Requests shall include the following information: Company Name, Address, CAGE Code, Attendee Name(s), the name, phone number and email address of the company's primary point of contact, and whether or not your company wants to participate in a one-on-one session.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions regarding the TMAS 2 program prior to the Industry Day. Please submit your questions, via email (with Subject Line "TMAS 2 Industry Day), to holly.deuser@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Contractors unable to attend Industry Day will not be excluded from participating in future Industry Days or from competing for this effort, as long as they have a contract under the applicable OASIS Pool, once determined. Briefings presented during this Industry Day, as well as Questions and Answers, will be posted to FedBizOps following the actual event.</p>
<p>This office will continue to communicate through FedBizOps until Option 1 of the GSA OASIS SB has been exercised; at that time, all communication will be conducted via the applicable GSA OASIS SB Pools' under which the individual TMAS 2 task orders will be awarded.</p>

Over the past 7 years, NASA ARC has partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a number of activities focused on the development of small / medium satellites, satellite systems and subsystems, assembly integration and test, mission assurance, mission design, responsive manufacturing, ground operations, and launch services - often employing innovative approaches in order to accelerate acquisition timelines. Several of these capabilities are currently being met through a suite of contracts, awarded in 2010, under a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract titled "Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW)" and a multiple award IDIQ contract titled "Modular Space Vehicle (MSV)". The SSPEDI acquisition is envisioned to serve as a follow-on to the RRSW and MSV contracts in the continued pursuit of innovative and affordable approaches through basic research, applied research, and advanced development focused on, but not limited to, payloads, buses (i.e. spacecraft subsystems such as life support; attitude control; guidance, navigation and control; command and data handling; communications system and antennas; power; thermal control; propulsion; and structures and trusses), ground systems / infrastructure and launch systems.

<DESC>EL VADO DAM GEOMEMBRANE DEMONSTRATION

SYNOPSIS for SOLICITATION NO. 140R4018Q0080

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE:   
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) requires a geomembrane installation field demonstration to be conducted at El Vado Dam, in north central New Mexico, to aid in the selection of a geomembrane system for a possible larger planned rehabilitation project.  The field trial will allow selected contractors to construct an approximately 20-foot-wide by 30-foot-tall demonstration panel on the upstream face of El Vado Dam with installation scheduled during September and October of 2018. 

The demonstration panels will be installed over the existing steel faceplate, spanning at least one V-shaped expansion joint.  The demonstration panels will include all components required for rehabilitation of the dam as a whole (i.e. drainage layer, drain/vent through the steel faceplate at the base of the demonstration panel, geotextile cushion, top and bottom perimeter seals, expansion and contraction control methods, connection to the concrete plinth at the toe of the dam, at least one vertical and horizontal field constructed panel seam, tensioning members, and intermediate mechanical anchorages to the underlying steel faceplate).  

El Vado Dam is located on the Rio Chama, approximately 25 miles southwest of Chama, New Mexico.  The dam is accessed using New Mexico State Highway 112, which runs across the dam crest.
Originally constructed in 1935, the embankment is a compacted gravel/rockfill structure. The primary water retention features at El Vado Dam are the steel faceplate liner on the upstream face of the embankment and a cutoff wall/grout curtain at the upstream toe of the dam.  The upstream slope of the dam is 1.5H:1V (horizontal:vertical).  The steel faceplate was constructed using approximately 8.3-feet tall by 24.4-feet wide steel panels that are about 0.25-inches thick.  The individual faceplate panels were welded together to form a continuous liner.  The steel faceplate is secured to a concrete plinth along the upstream cutoff wall alignment.  Vertical expansion joints were positioned between each of the faceplate sections at 25-foot centers.  The vertical expansion joints are continuous, extending from the upstream toe of the dam to the base of the curved parapet wall/wave deflector, and consist of a V-shaped channel about 6-inches deep and about 6-inches wide.  The expansion joints were bolted and then welded to adjacent faceplate panels.
Temperature related expansion and contraction, reservoir operation and hydraulic loading, left abutment landslide movements, and point loading at the base of the liner have caused cracks and tears to occur in the steel faceplate.  The cracks and tears mostly occur in the base of the expansion joint channels or where the expansion joint was welded to the steel faceplates.  New cracks and tears are typically noted by a spike in the seepage rates measured downstream.  The steel faceplates not adjacent to the expansion joints are in relatively good condition. 
The dam location is at high elevation at 8,914 feet at the dam crest.  Temperature considerations for the area are available at Western Regional Climate Center for EL Vado Dam, New Mexico, Station 292837.  The data indicates temperature extremes of lows of minus 45 degrees to highs of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
The objective of the acquisition is to award multiple contracts to vendors that are qualified to install a demonstration of geomembrane to the face of the El Vado dam and provide testing materials for lab testing. This project is being administered by the Bureau of Reclamation, Provo Area Office. This will also help to provide market research for a potential larger scale project to cover the entire dam with a geomembrane cover. 
This solicitation is a full and open competition and the Government intends to issue four firm-fixed price purchase orders to the responsible quoters that meet the requirements of the solicitation or provide the best value to the project. 
COMPETITION:  
The intent of the solicitation 140R4018Q0080 is to be a full and open competition.   The requirement shall be procured in accordance FAR 36, Construction and Architect -- Engineer Contracts and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. 

NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD:

<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) intends to award a sole source contract to Center for American Indian Health Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 415 N. Washington St., Baltimore, MD 21231 for the acquisition of the effort entitled "Haemophilus influenzae among southwestern American Indian children". <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is NAICS 541990 - Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.<br /><br />Historically, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children aged &lt;5 years have suffered from invasive H. influenzae type b (Hib) disease at rates at least 5 times higher than the general U.S. population. Following introduction of a primary series and booster dose with conjugate Hib vaccine in the late 1980s, rates of Hib disease decreased substantially among both AI/AN and non-Native children. However, rates of Hib disease among AI/AN children remain much higher than among non-AI/AN children, despite Hib vaccine coverage similar to or greater than the national average and proven efficacy of Hib vaccine in this population. Additionally, AI/AN children aged &lt;5 years have a higher incidence of all forms of invasive H. influenzae disease than children in all other races. Despite comprising &lt;3% of the general population, it is estimated that 10% of the burden of invasive H. influenzae disease in the US occurs in AI/AN individuals, reflecting a serious health disparity in a life-threatening illness.
<p>In recent years, active Hib surveillance conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Center for American Indian Health (CAIH) has identified a shift in Hib disease among Navajo children &lt;5 years: while Hib disease historically peaked in infants 4-6 months of age, two-thirds of cases in the past 3 years have occurred in children aged 1-5 years who have received &ge;2 doses of Hib vaccine. Most recently, CAIH has noted a concerning increase in Hib disease among Navajo children &lt;5 years. Additionally, invasive disease caused by H. influenzae serotype a (Hia) has increased in recent years in the United States. While rates of Hia are increasing among all children in the U.S., Navajo children have a substantially greater incidence; among Navajo children &lt;5 years of age in 2004-2016, the average annual rate was 16.7 cases/100,000 population. This is compared to an incidence of Hia disease in children &lt;5 years of age from 2002-2014 at 0.43 per 100,000 in the general U.S. population.</p>
<p>These epidemiologic changes and increase in disease among the Navajo may be due to a persistent reservoir of Hib carriage in the community, waning immunity following vaccination, or other unrecognized risk factors. Hib vaccination induces serum antibody production (anti-PRP) and reduces the nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of H. influenzae type b, thereby diminishing the risk of invasive disease. Reductions in carriage also reduce transmission of Hib between individuals. Numerous studies have documented declines in Hib carriage following vaccination, although this effect appears to wane with increasing time since last vaccination. In settings where resurgent Hib disease has been detected, a reservoir of carriage has been identified in school-aged children. In the pre-Hib vaccine era, invasive Hib disease occurred at a younger age in AI/AN children compared to general U.S. children. To provide early protection, the PRP-OMP Hib vaccine, which elicits protective antibody concentrations after one dose, was preferentially recommended for the primary series in AI/AN children. However, the peak (post-booster) antibody concentration is lower for PRP-OMP compared to other Hib vaccines. Waning immunity following the booster dose may result in susceptibility to infection, especially if exposure to Hib via oropharyngeal colonization in the community is ongoing. Knowledge of disease burden and Hia carriage in this at-risk population could impact future policy decisions regarding any other potential new vaccines. <br /><br />The purpose of this project is to (1) determine whether a reservoir for Hia and Hib transmission exists among AI children by assessing oropharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae; (2) determine if waning immunity to Hib vaccination may be contributing to invasive H. influenzae disease by assessing sero-prevalence of anti-PRP antibodies; and (3) assess current risk factors for invasive Hia and Hib disease among AI children by conducting a case-control study. <br /><br />The Center for American Indian Health (CAIH) is an independent center within the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health with satellite offices on tribal lands of the White Mountain, Navajo Nation and Santo Domingo pueblo. CAIH has a history of over 35 years of collaboration with Southwestern tribes; their current programs reach more than 100 tribal communities in 16 states. They currently operate 10 field offices in 4 tribal communities, employing staff from the American Indian (AI) community, and supporting the development, implementation and evaluation of public health activities to improve the health of AI communities. They are a trusted community partner and have relationships with the Indian Health Service, tribal leadership and community-based organizations. There is no other known to CDC group with comparable surveillance or research infrastructure established among this target population. This type of proposed investigation can only be carried out by CAIH due to existing programs, support and research capability. Therefore, this company is uniquely positioned to performing this study. Thus, the Center for American Indian Health (CAIH), is the only company that can be used. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Center for American Indian Health (CAIH). However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by August 2, 2018. <strong>The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing.</strong> <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Liubov Kriel by email at vyh1@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number 75D30118-R-67930 on the subject line.</p>

<p>SELECTION CRITERIA<br />The A-E firm must demonstrate the team's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria 1 through 4 are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria 5 is of lesser importance and will be used as a tiebreaker among technically equal firms.</p>
<p>SF330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly-qualified firm based on criterion responses. Failure to provide requested data or to comply with the instructions in this notice could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration. Brooks Act (PL 92-582) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. Specific evaluation criteria include:</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 1-Specialized Experience (SF 330 Part I, Section F):</strong></p>
<p>Projects should demonstrate the ability to perform both hydrographic magnetometer surveys and provide subsequent analysis and reports.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Firms shall provide a maximum of seven (7) projects completed, or substantially completed, within the five years prior to the SF330 due date that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas set forth above. A substantially completed project would include completed documentation that does not have to be a final deliverable(s); however, the documentation cannot have data gaps or missing analysis. At least five of the seven projects submitted must be in the principle geographic area of this contract.</p>
<p>All projects provided in the SF330 must have been performed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part I, Section F, item 25-"Firms from Section C Involved in this Project," block 1; include a contract number, task order number, or project identification number in block 21; include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c); and include, in the project description, the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. If the offeror is a joint venture, submit relevant project experience for the joint venture (if shared experience is available); otherwise, project experience may be submitted for any joint venture partner(s). Joint venture offerors are still limited to a maximum of seven projects. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners on that project are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner(s) offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and that entity's roles and responsibilities on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. Projects are not required from each member of a joint venture; however joint ventures offering relevant experience from each member may be considered more favorably. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.</p>
<p>Projects not completed, or substantially completed, will be excluded from evaluation consideration. For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract, a standalone contract, or a series of task orders that when combined result in a single EA or EIS is considered a project. Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project.</p>
<p>Instead, list relevant substantially-completed task orders that fit within the definition above. Examples of work submitted that do not meet the definition of a project will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Failure to provide all requested data could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration. All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part I, Section F of the SF330.</p>
<p>The Government will not consider information submitted in addition to Part I, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Criterion 2-Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF330 Part I, Sections E and G):</strong></p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on the professional qualifications, competence, and related experience of the key personnel to accomplish the work proposed under this contract. Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines required to satisfy the requirements of the scope listed above will result in the firm being considered not qualified. Professional Licensed Surveyor must be included in key personnel.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel that illustrate experience in the work proposed under this contract. R&eacute;sum&eacute;s are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience; indicate proposed role in this contract; and provide information on professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation. Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF330 Part I, Section G.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Criterion 3-Capacity to accomplish work in the required time (SF330 Part I, Section H):</strong></p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on the ability to perform and manage similar projects. Evaluation includes ability to meet aggressive schedules and control costs as well as the ability to offer innovations relevant to management of work under this contract.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Describe the firm's ability to perform this requirement, able to meet aggressive schedules and control costs. For this factor, details should be provided on firm's capabilities to conduct hydrographic/magnetometer surveys and submit and integrate electronic deliverables.</p>
<p>Include the past working experience and relationships with team members, including joint venture members if applicable.</p>
<p>Greater weight will be placed on offerors whose firms have established working relationships with the proposed team members and/or joint venture partners for similar work.</p>
<p>Identify any innovations the firm can offer, providing examples such as how the firm has improved quality and generated efficiencies in management of past projects.</p>
<p><strong><br />Criterion 4-Past Performance (SF 330 Part I, Section H):</strong></p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated based on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction with an emphasis on example projects presented in Criterion 1 and past performance assessments (see submission requirements below). The Government may also utilize other information provided by the firm or obtained via customer inquiries, information in Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contact with points of contact identified in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Submit a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation for each example project listed under Criterion 1. If there is not a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1-Specialized Experience. An offeror shall not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS/ACASS is available.</p>
<p>If a CPARS/ACASS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and e-mail addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with the firm's SF330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, the offeror should complete and submit with its response the first page of the PPQ providing contract and client information for the respective project(s).

FOLLOWING INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE A/E FIRMS AND THEIR SF330S,  A SOLICITATION FOR A PRICE PROPOSAL WILL BE SENT TO THE HIGHEST TECHNICALLY RATED A/E FIRM TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF SERVICE(S) REQUIRED. 

The A/E Services contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6.  In accordance with FAR 36.209  Construction Contracts With Architect-Engineer Firms , no contract for the construction of a project shall be awarded to the firm that designed the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates, except with the approval of the head of the agency or authorized representative.

<p>Solicitation: NIHDA201800158-NOI</p>
<p>Title: Procurement of a Digitizer and an Amplifier</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support Contracts and Simplified Acquisitions Branch (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a contract for the procurement of an Amplifier and Digitizer with Molecular Devices, LLC, 3860 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95134-1702.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 3345160 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal acquisition Requlation (FAR) in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-97, June 15, 2018.</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 - Only one response source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this order is to purchase an amplifier and digitizer for the synaptic plasticity section within the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).</p>
<p>The amplifier and digitizer will be used to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions that underlie the function of neurons and glial cells during physiological states and pathological conditions, such as reward, motivated behaviors, addiction, neurodegeneration. More specifically, this equipment will be used to as integral components of an inverted microscope electrophysiology set-up for recording in isolated cells. The current setups are limited to electrophysiology in brain slices, which does not allow for high through-put screening of electrophysiological parameters between normal and pathological conditions or drug testing, allowing us to answer critical questions about ion channel and receptor function, that were not previously possible for our branch to answer.</p>
<p><br />We want to determine the neural mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug craving and other animal behavior models of drug addiction. The microscope system is primarily for the synaptic plasticity section; however it can be shared as needed with other NIDA labs. Our section does not have an inverted microscope electrophysiology set-up, which is most commonly used for recordings from isolated or cultured cells. Currently, we are traveling to NINDS to use a similar set-up.  It has become clear that we cannot do our required research without this equipment and a number of users and projects would greatly benefit from this equipment within NIDA.  Additionally, we chose an amplifier and digitizer that are compatible with a wide-range of uses. Based on the lifetime of previous electrophysiology set-ups, there is no reason to expect that this equipment will not perform for the next thirty years.</p>
<p>Project Description<br />The Axon multiclamp amplifier 700B, digitizer 1550B without Hum silencer, and Clampex/Clampfit acquisition/analysis software package is a latest generation acquisition system with several unique features that combined contribute to superior resolution, low-noise, and versatile electrophysiology and electrochemistry.</p>
<p>Please see the attached Purchase Description (PD) for further details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule<br />Within 60 days after award</p>
<p>Delivery or Deliverables<br />See PD for further details.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>Responses to this solicitation must include clear and convincing evidence of the offeror's capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the technical evaluation criteria.  The price proposal must include the labor categories, an estimate of the number of hours required for each labor category, fully loaded fixed hourly rate or each labor category, breakdown and rationale for other direct costs or materials, and the total amount.</p>
<p>In addition the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size must be included in the response. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov." <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by Wednesday, July 25, 2018 at 2:00PM, Eastern Standard Time, and reference number NIHDA201800158-NOI. Responses may be submitted electronically to Danielle R. Brown, Contract Specialist, at Danielle.brown2@nih.gov.</p>
<p>Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Extensions to the deadline will not be granted.</p>
<p>Please contact Danielle R. Brown, Contract Specialist, at Danielle.brown2@nih.gov or (301) 594-1928 with any questions.</p>

<p><strong>Contracting Officer:</strong> Jeffrey Schmidt, 301-402-1488, jeffrey.schmidt@nih.gov</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition Authority:</strong> This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and the resultant contract award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-99 / June 15, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>North American Classification System (NAICS) Code:</strong> The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 325199 - All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 1,250 employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Set-aside Status:</strong> Small Business set-aside restriction is not applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Competition Status: </strong> This requirement is posted as non-competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Competitive (Single-sole Source (Including brand-name)) Determination: </strong>This notice of proposed acquisition is posted as an intent to award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis to Sigma Aldrich, Inc. located at 3050 Spruce Street, St. Louis, MO 63103. The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted specifically producing no other sources of supply or service capable of achieving this Government requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of Requirement:</strong> The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase sixty 500 mL bottles of Sigma Fetal Bovine Serum (Batch No. 18A079).</p>
<p>Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) plays a critical role in the growth proliferation characteristics of many cell types.  Keeping the same batch of FBS from the same manufacturer is essential to the many ongoing genome wide screens and follow-up screens.  Changing the manufacturer and batch of FBS at this point would negate the genes of interest that were highlighted as a result of this particular batch of FBS in a given genome wide screen.  The follow-up studies which are conducted based on these results would not yield the desired results if the batch of FBS was changed.  This would be detrimental to the NCATS work and lab as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of thirty-five projects which are ongoing that use Sigma Fetal Bovine Serum, Heat Inactivated, Batch No. 18A079.  All of these projects have passed the initial assay development stage and are now at various critical junctions at which changing the batch of FBS would cause effects to the growth of the cells and in turn significantly impact the project as a whole (e.g. adverse effects to gene hit selections and cell viability).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ongoing projects include:  RNAi screening to identify novel therapies in rhabdomyosarcoma; mechanisms of cellular aging and tumorigenesis; deciphering the molecular pathology of Merkel cell carcinoma using a genome-wide RNAi synthetic lethal approach with Navitoclax; and identification of factors affecting exosome biogenesis and delivery by RNAi screening.</p>
<p>Sigma Fetal Bovine Serum, Heat Inactivated, Batch No. 18A079 listed herein is available from only one source, and competition is precluded for the reasons indicated above. There are no substitutes available.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Date or Period of Performance: </strong>Within 30 days ARO.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging, Marking and Shipping: </strong>Ship to the address shown below and the packages must contain a packing list that is attached to the outside of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Location:</strong><br />National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences<br />9800 Medical Center Dr., Bldg B<br />Rockville, MD  20850</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong> Offerors shall be evaluated on the ability to meet the requirements contained in this Statement of Work (SOW); specifically, by providing literature or other documentation demonstrating the ability to meet each element listed in the SOW. One offeror will be selected that is most advantageous to the Government based on their technical ability and costs.<br /> <br /><strong>Summary Statement: </strong> This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals or quotations.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about May 24, 2018.  Interested parties may request a copy of the solicitation or identify their interest and capability by contacting the Contracting Officer specified in this announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All responses must be received by July 27, 2018 at 12:00 pm, Eastern Time.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted electronically to Jeffrey Schmidt, jeffrey.schmidt@nih.gov, and must reference the solicitation number NIHDA201800343, on your electronic request.  FAX requests are not accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to solicit proposals in response to Request for Proposal (RFP) number 86543G18R00003 for Supplemental Claims Processing and Property Disposition Support Services for the Office of Single-Family Post Insurance Division (SFPID).
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is to inform the industry that a Total Small Business Set-Aside solicitation is planned to be released between the months of June 2018 through July 2018. The period of performance is one (1) base year period, and four (4), one (1) year option year periods. The award will be with a maximum life of 5 years of performance. The Government contemplates award of a single Firm Fixed Price contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The Business Size Standard is $15 million dollars per annum. The Product Service Code is R703 - Support Management Accounting Services. To be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the Systems for Award Management (SAM) database under the corresponding NAICS code solicited. Upon issuance of the solicitation, the solicitation documents may be obtained via the Federal Business Opportunity(FBO) website www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>HUD, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for lenders against losses from financing the purchase of single family homes. In addition, FHA manages properties acquired in exchange for the payment of insurance benefits due to loss. FHA has a need to obtain support to assist in the control and processing of insurance claims and the financial management of acquired property in support of the Single Family (SF) Property Disposition (SFPD) Program.</p>
<p>SFPID has two branches, the SF Claims Branch (SFCB) and the SF Acquired Assets Branch (SFAAB); support is required for both branches.</p>
<p>The SFCB is responsible for the payment of insurance benefits based on claims filed by FHA-Approved Lending Institutions. Other responsibilities include the receipt and disposition of mail and correspondence relating to claims processing, claim forms, and other miscellaneous documents. To ensure that claims submitted by mortgagees for insurance benefits are reviewed and processed in an accurate and timely manner, the SFCB requires support in processing of supplemental claims, delivery of incoming mail, and file maintenance. Claim processing is largely automated and carried out by the SF Claims subsystem (CLAIMS/A43C) of the SF Insurance System (SFIS/A43). The supplemental claim process is manual. After the initial claim payment, FHA-Approved lenders may elect to submit a supplemental claim to account for trailing expenses and/or corrections to the initial claim. Servicers submit the claim and supporting documents on paper. FHA currently has a backlog of 40,000 claims and receives approximately 4,000 supplemental claim applications monthly. <br /><br />The SFAAB acquires, manages, and sells single family properties annually under its SFPD Program. To operate this program, HUD staff at its Headquarters in Washington, District of Columbia, and four HOCs across the nation (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Santa Ana, California) utilize the SF Acquired Asset Management System (SAMS/A80S) to manage and account for its portfolio of acquired properties. SAMS maintains approximately 100,000 profiles of payees who perform services required to hold, market, and sell HUD's SF property inventory. Currently, approximately 800 payee file maintenance activities are processed per month. <br /><br />Below are the characteristics of the claims and property services requirements:<br />&bull; Demonstrable knowledge in Single Family regulations and policies and Mortgagee Letters. <br />&bull; Demonstrable knowledge in Name Address Identification (NAID) application processing.<br />&bull; Previous experience in the review, processing, and disbursement of Single Family insurance claims.<br />&bull; Ability to image and archive documents containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).<br />&bull; Skills in oral and written communication.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Financial Services Center (VA-FSC), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, New Jersey, intends to issue a modification to modification to firm-fixed price (FFP) contract number VA118-17-C-2307, with Vertical Design, LLC (Vertical) pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled,  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals.   However, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541512 and size standard is $27.5M.

Contract VA118-17-C-2307 is being modified to provide additional work required to support NCPTSD s critical role in creating training and educational products to support evidence-based care of Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and related problems.  The following additional work is required for Option Period 1: porting two existing applications to mobile Operating Systems (OS), Couples Coach and VetChange; development of two research version mobile applications, Skills, Training, In Affective, and Interpersonal Regulations (STAIR) Coach 2.0, Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) for both Android and Apple OS; and a major upgrade of mobile application VetChange to include additional features and tools that correlate to the VetChange website.  Additionally, the following modifications are required for the current services provided under Contract VA118-17-C-2307 to support NCPTSD s growth of its mobile applications portfolio: additional services for SaaS hosting and web application programming interfaces (API) to include the VetChange website; increased granularity for mobile application instrumentation; reduced gift card incentives; and increased optional task maintenance support hours.  From January 2018 through May 2018, NCPTSD was tasks to support outside offices including HSD&D, Behavioral Health Sciences Division, and the Office of Rural Health with research assessments as part of NCPTSD s mobile app portfolio.  In order to support these office s research initiatives new mobile applications STAIR 2.0 and HSR&D need to be developed in order to capture research assessment information specific to these offices.  Additionally, the VetChange mobile app requires major upgrade to support the Behavioral Health Sciences Division research to support implementation in care and correlate with the VetChange website.  Additionally, from January 2018 through June 2018, NCPTSD has conducted surveys and training with VA providers on their mobile app services.  VA providers had given feedback that mobile apps that do not have Android versions have made it difficult for them to recommend the apps to patients.  Through NCPTSD s environmental review of how the apps are used in practice by providers concluded that NCPTSD needed to prioritize Android versions of these apps, specifically Couples Coach and VetChange.  These research initiatives and feedback had emerged after contract VA118-17-C-2307 has been awarded on September 1, 2017 and therefore could not have been anticipated at award.  As such, a modification is required to provide these services.  These services are critical to continued support of NCPTSD clinical care and research trials, which are essential to providing reliable, high-quality mental health services to Veterans, their families, and health care providers.    Any disruption would significantly impact funded research trials which rely on data collection from the SaaS hosted solution.  The period of performance for this modification will align with the 12-month period of performance for Option Period 1, which is September 1, 2018 through August 31, 2019.

This notification shall close on August 2, 2018. Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Jessica.Adamitis@va.gov with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-17-C-2307.

<p>The Government is conducting market research and identifying, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements as specified in the Program Description below.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>An EEG is commonly used in the diagnosis and evaluation of epileptic seizures, encephalopathy, brain death, dementia, and coma patients. The review station will increase the neurologist's access to already performed studies while the EEG machine itself is being used for a live procedure. This will help to improve productivity and contribute to the accurate diagnosis and treatment of our patients. The neurologists will also be able to go back and look at past studies without waiting for the machine to be available.</p>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>1. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.).</p>
<p>2. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>3. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed via email to Cassaundra Jenks (AFLCMC/PZIBA), cassaundra.jenks@us.af.mil no later than 12:00 pm EST on 23 July 2018. Please use the subject line: EEG System and Review Station - Sources Sought. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>4. If your company is interested, submit your responses to the Sources Sought to cassaundra.jenks@us.af.mil. E-mail responses should be received no later than 12:00 pm EST on 27 July 2018.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION: </strong>This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the U.S. Government is conducting market research. The intended purpose is to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the 88th Medical Treatment Facility's requirement. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Furthermore, the 88th Medical Treatment Facility is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this sources sought. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this sources sought will be solely at the responding party's expense. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this FedBizOpps website for additional information pertaining to this source sought.</p>

<p>Subject: RFI: W909MY-18-R-C014 - ATR Technology - "Company Name".</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The primary objective of this RFI is to canvas a wide community of traditional and non-traditional providers of technology solutions and services to help identify current state of art in the areas of aided and automatic target detection, recognition and tracking for Electro Optical Infra-Red (EOIR) sensors. This includes, but is not limited to, machine learning and deep learning approaches for real-time exploitation and enhanced situational awareness for ground-based manned and unmanned platforms operating in complex rural and urban environments. The primary emphasis of the RFI is to identify Aided Target Detection (AiTD) and Aided Target Recognition (AiTR) algorithms, image and video processing, machine vision, and sensor exploitation technologies for manned and unmanned ground vehicles to enable increasing levels of artificial intelligence. However, new and emerging computing hardware technologies aimed at SWAP-C constrained implementation of the state of the art sensor exploitation algorithms in real-time are also of interest.</p>
<p>Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>Aided Target Detection and Recognition Technologies for Manned and Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Complex Environments</p>
<p>RFI Objectives:</p>
<p>o Help identify mature, reliable and robust Aided Target Detection (AiTD) and Aided Target Recognition (AiTR) algorithms, processing modules, and computing technologies that can operate in real time on EOIR sensors mounted on ground combat systems to improve situational awareness and reduce workload of the Soldier.</p>
<p>o Help identify current state of the art for AiTD and AiTR approaches and behaviors in increasingly difficult environments to include complex urban and rural terrain.</p>
<p>o Help identify potential capabilities for near term integration into current ground combat platforms.</p>
<p>o Help identify candidate capabilities for maturation and possible later integration into current fleet and new development vehicles.</p>
<p>o Help identify well qualified providers of reliable and robust capabilities, products and services in the areas of algorithm design, development, implementation and integration for manned and unmanned ground combat systems.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Grounds Belvoir Division, on behalf of the CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), is requesting information on interested and capable sources for potential award(s) of a contract or contracts related to affordable and mature processing and exploitation algorithms, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies suitable for application in manned and unmanned ground combat systems to improve soldier capabilities and effectiveness. The desired product must be able to be fully integrated with EOIR sensors on manned and unmanned military ground vehicles (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), Bradley, Abrams, Stryker, MRAP, NGCV, etc.) while observing their specific space constraints and operational environments.</p>
<p>Advancements in EOIR sensor technology have enabled integration of cameras with higher resolutions, improved sensitivity, and multi-spectral imaging onto ground vehicle platforms. These sensors play a critical role in movement, situational awareness and target acquisition in combat environments day and night and have become an integral part of the warfighter's capabilities. Current imaging sensors however largely rely on soldier's continued attention on the image/video display. An abundance of sensors and the complexity of tasks in complex environments has made this a daunting task for the Soldier. Recent advances in image exploitation, artificial intelligence and machine learning coupled with a surge in demand for increased autonomy of ground platforms have reinvigorated the interest in automatic target detection, recognition, identification and tracking technologies. AiTD and AiTR will be used on manned platforms to help reduce Soldier workload, improve situational awareness, and reduce response times. On unmanned ground platforms, AiTD and AiTR become a fundamental enabling technology for autonomous operation and mission execution.</p>
<p>Traditional AiTD and AiTR algorithm development has focused on Moving Target Indication (MTI) and Static Target Indication (STI) of military targets in relatively unpopulated low clutter rural environments. While this is still an important function, in the future, manned and unmanned ground vehicle platforms will be operated in increasingly complex environments, to include high clutter rural environments such as vehicles or ATGM teams in defilade; as well as urban areas where the enemies may blend in with natural patterns of life. Future AiTD and AiTR approaches will be required to perform basic detection and recognition functionalities in this environment, but will also need to provide more advanced automated behaviors to discriminate and prioritize potential threats.<br /><br />Significant technological challenges exist to successfully utilizing traditional computer vision and emerging machine learning technologies in operational combat environments. Some of these challenges include robustness and reliability of algorithms, SWAP-C of computational hardware, and limited data communication and computational bandwidth. However, arguably a bigger challenge to successfully deliver of AiTR/AiTD capabilities to the warfighter has been the mismatch between the operational requirement/expectation of the soldier and the capabilities and readiness of the AiTR/AiTD technology. As such, this RFI is aimed to better understand the state of the art and identify capable technology providers in the broad area of image and video processing and exploitation in complex settings.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br />AiTR/AiTD for ground vehicles is ultimately desired to work on sensors for both static and on-the-move vehicles in real-time in diverse environments. Industry may propose a currently available solution as well as a research or prototype effort. Responses are encouraged to include a discussion on the current development status and the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the algorithm, as well as any applicable test or demonstration results. Technology development roadmaps that show products at TRL 6 for incremental capability transition in FY19, FY22, and FY24 are also of interest. For the purposes of this RFI, TRL 6 AITR/D algorithms are defined to have been demonstrated on prototype sensors and platforms in real time in realistic environments and conditions.</p>
<p>While integrated end-to-end processing and exploitation solutions are also encouraged, given the evolving nature of the requirement and technology it is expected that this RFI is going to help identify many different enablers which will be integrated through a flexible and adaptable software and computing hardware architecture to mature technology to high technology readiness level to meet specific warfighter requirements. In particular, training data requirements for new machine learning approaches will challenge typical development processes for ground-based AiTR/AiTD. Solutions that enable data collection and/or data generation for large quantities of ground-to-ground EOIR imagery as well as techniques to help with rapid groundtruthing and labeling are applicable.</p>
<p>The following is a short list indicative of the possible capabilities that may be of interest for both narrow field of view (FOV) targeting sensors as well as wide FOV search and/or situational awareness sensors.</p>
<p>- Automated search and detection for military targets of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicles, personnel, weapons systems, and UAS that may be fully exposed or partially obscured.</p>
<p>- Automated recognition or classification of targets to include military versus civilian vehicles, weapon/no weapon discrimination, and facial recognition.</p>
<p>- Automated multi-target tracking.</p>
<p>- Algorithms that provide enhanced discrimination, tracking, and other advanced capabilities in dense urban settings.</p>
<p>- Algorithms compatible with high definition uncooled IR sensors used for 360&#730; situational awareness.</p>
<p>- Algorithms compatible with existing fielded Second Generation (2GF) FLIR sensors.</p>
<p>- Algorithms that leverage multi-spectral sensors, such as Third Generation (3GEN) FLIR.</p>
<p>- Collaborative AiTD/AiTR, between ground vehicle sensors or ground vehicle sensors and small UAS.</p>
<p>- EOIR data sets including ground-to-ground militarily relevant targets, as well as solutions to collect and/or generate relevant imagery with groundtruth or labels for training<br /><br />Sensor Oriented Requirements</p>
<p>Next generation IR cameras have large formats such as 1280 &times; 960, 1920 &times; 1200, and 2K &times; 2K with typical frame rates at 30 Hz to 60 Hz. EO cameras are available in even higher pixel formats and frame rates. Multi-spectral sensors such as 3GEN FLIR are also becoming available.</p>
<p>While the objective is to ultimately develop technology that can work day/night on infrared sensors, responses that have focused on visible sensor development are acceptable to show development status. Responses that exploit multi-spectral sensors are encouraged as well. AiTR and AiTD capabilities are desired on both narrow FOV targeting sensors as well as wide FOV search and/or situational awareness sensors.</p>
<p>The intent of this RFI is to identify an ecosystem of algorithms, exploitation capabilities, and machine vision approaches that can be leveraged (within reason) with a wide variety of sensor types including but not limited to EO and IR sensors of different spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions.</p>
<p>Computing Hardware Oriented Requirements</p>
<p>While the primary emphasis of this RFI is on algorithms, software implementation and architectures to enable real-time AiTR/AiTD capabilities, it is also important to understand the ecosystem of the computing hardware on which these capabilities may be hosted. In that spirit, submission on new and evolving computing hardware architectures for efficient, low Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) computing is encouraged. Submission on specific embedded, FPGA or ASIC implementation of well-defined visual processing and exploitation capabilities or tools that can be embedded in a larger system level solution are also encouraged. Although the primary purpose of this hardware is to execute AiTD/AiTR software, this hardware may interact with related on- and off-platform systems. As such, technologies that support low-latency distribution of real-time sensor video from high bandwidth EO/IR sensors to multiple consumers (human or machine) are of interest. Approaches that enable rapid real-time prototyping, adaptation, and implementation of algorithm approaches are also of interest.</p>
<p>Operational and Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>AiTR/AiTD algorithms will be required to be effective in a broad array of environmental conditions on ground vehicle platforms of various sizes and configurations. The following list highlights some operational and environmental considerations for algorithm performance:</p>
<p>- Broad array of rural and urban environments with varying degrees of natural and man-made clutter</p>
<p>- Static or moving targets, partially obscured targets</p>
<p>- Targets over a broad range of operationally relevant ranges, i.e., close to the vehicle and at significant standoff</p>
<p>- Real-time operation with both static and on-the-move platforms</p>
<p>-Tracking persistence for slewable sensors</p>

<DESC>The Work Directives issued hereunder shall involve research and development efforts on various aspects related to Assured Mobility and Maneuver Support material solutions.
<p>The term "Assured Mobility" encompasses those actions and material and design solutions that give commanders the ability to deploy, move, and maneuver assets where and when they desire, without interruption or delay, to achieve the mission. The imperatives and principles of Assured Mobility are what will enable future forces to have superior situational understanding and, therefore, unsurpassed freedom of movement in global terrain and climate profiles; tropical, arid, temperate, continental, and polar.</p>
<p>The term "Maneuver Support" encompasses those actions and material and design solutions that give commanders the ability to maintain an unprecedented level of freedom of movement at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels in all environments. Materiel items most relevant to Maneuver Support efforts include Survivability, Countermine, Track and Suspension, Power Management, Robotics, Bridging systems and Combat Engineer Equipment for freedom of maneuver through construction of obstacles, unstructured terrain, and for interrogation of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and route clearance (mobility and counter-mobility operations).</p>

<p>Background: The NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) is a shared, intramural resource for preclinical animal imaging studies. The MIF provides the NIH intramural research community access to modern radiological imaging equipment optimized for rodents and other laboratory animals for noninvasive imaging studies. The MIF provides intellectual, technical and material support for NIH investigators, and resources include: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), high frequency ultrasound with photoacoustic imaging, bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging. The MIF is dedicated to providing state-of-the-art anatomical, functional and molecular medical imaging capabilities for animal models of human disease.</p>
<p>Animals must be completely still during imaging to obtain diagnostic image data. Animals are anesthetized in order to restrain and immobilize them for optimal imaging. While the animal is imaged in the scanner anesthetized and inaccessible, it is imperative to monitor vital physiological parameters in order to assess the level of anesthesia and how the animal is doing while under anesthesia. Necessary parameters include: heart rate (HR), ECG, pulse oximetry (SpO2), blood pressure (BP) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2). Accurate physiological monitoring equipment is necessary for animal welfare, as well as to meet the requirements of Federal guidelines, the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and the Public Health Service Research Extension Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (The Guide).</p>

<div>This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was officially established in fiscal year 2012 to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. NCATS, one of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH, strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.</p>
<p>The NCATS Chemistry group is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules and develop novel disease models for application against a wide range of human diseases.</p>
<p>NCATS has a potential requirement for maintenance service on existing government-owned Teledyne ISCO flash systems to cover any service situations that arise on this highly used and important equipment currently in use by the NCATS Chemistry area. This potential requirement will eliminate the amount of down time experienced when any performance issues occur. The Teledyne ISCO flash systems are integral pieces of equipment in the synthesis of small molecules as biological probes. Maintenance service must be performed</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain annual maintenance service and full coverage on an existing, government-owned CombiFlash Rf/Rf+ Chromatography System manufactured and produced by Teledyne Instruments, Inc located at 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, by a manufacturer-authorized service provider from an OEM-certified technician.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC) an intramural R&amp;D division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) requires a large university in the United States, that is a member of the Kenya Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) consortium, to evaluate several low-cost x-ray image acquisition techniques that are generate adequate quality images for both human-expert assessment as well as automated machine-learning based decision making. This work is an essential component of an LHC research project investigating "Computer capture and automatic processing of digital radiology images in remote and difficult to access settings." The contractor shall acquire these four major components and related accessories: (i) a low-cost and suitable battery-operated x-ray image generator; (ii) a low-cost power-generator that will be used to recharge the batteries of the x-ray image generator; (iii) a photo-voltaic solar power panel for charging the battery-operated x-ray image generator; and, (iv) an ultra-capacitor bank for image use on existing mobile x-ray imaging devices. Existing high-power gasoline powered generator will serve as the baseline for comparison of image quality and overall operation costs compared to the options acquired above.<br />AMPATH is a partnership between Moi University School of Medicine, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH - Kenya's second national referral hospital in Eldoret, Kenya), and a consortium of U.S. medical schools founded in 1997. It is a provider of healthcare resources in rural Western Kenya. Medical institutions providing healthcare and conducting clinical and informatics research in Kenya must be members of AMPATH, and only participating U.S. medical schools may be involved in healthcare delivery, and clinical and informatics research. Membership is essential to acquire and ship equipment since AMPATH will not accept items from non-member organizations. Non-member organizations will not be able to ship medical equipment to Kenya without proper justification afforded by AMPATH membership and its collaboration with the Ministry of Health in the Government of Kenya.</p>
<p>The partnership is led by Indiana University School of Medicine and includes several other universities and research organizations. The AMPATH mission is to address and reduce barriers to high quality care in the resource-constrained setting of Eldoret, the fifth largest city in Kenya, located on the Western side of the Rift valley. In partnership with USAID, AMPATH (www.iukenya.org/hiv.aids.html) now manages the largest AIDS prevention and treatment program in sub-Saharan Africa, and cares for more than 200,000 HIV-infected adults and children, in 48 sites across a 300-mile swath of western Kenya. Nearly one-half of these patients are on anti-retroviral drugs. Four-wheel drive vehicles can only access most of these sites due to difficult, unpaved roads. <br /><br />Many newly diagnosed HIV positive patients harbor tuberculosis (TB). Before starting treatment for HIV, it is crucial to know if a patient with HIV also has active TB. Patients with HIV and TB are at grave risk for a severe and potentially fatal reaction if the TB is not treated before antiretroviral therapy for the HIV is started. TB is a major cause of morbidity and mortality to these patients and represents a source of contagion to their HIV negative family and neighbors. Chest radiography is common and required component in the protocol to confirm TB infection. Therefore, it is critical to the detection and proper treatment of tuberculosis in HIV patients, but only six of the AMPATH sites have x-ray equipment and only the main MTRH Eldoret, Kenya. <br />In recent years, AMPATH has acquired and is operating two trucks equipped with mobile x-ray imaging and cellular data transmission capability that are operating in rural areas of western Kenya. The x-ray imager is powered using high voltage gasoline-powered generators that consume high amounts of fuel resulting in high operating and maintenance costs.<br /><br />AMPATH created these original mobile radiology systems using equipment purchased under previous agreements with NLM (based on Computed Radiography (CR) approach). This contract will be used to evaluate a lower power battery powered x-ray generator as an alternative to current models. This evaluation will be on operational power efficiency while maintaining adequate image quality so as to support automated machine-learning-based decision making using software developed in intramural NLM R&amp;D effort. <br /><br />Operational efficiency will be measured and compared against operational costs using current imaging equipment and alternatives using an ultra-capacitor bank for powering the existing image generator. In turn the ultra-capacitor bank will be recharged using a lower power generator. Alternatives to the current x-ray image generator will also be evaluated using a battery-powered x-ray imager which could be powered using a smaller low-cost low-voltage generator that would consume less fuel, and, alternatively, using a photovoltaic solar power panel to charge the battery of the new x-ray imager. <br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br />The purpose of this contract is to (i) purchase, deploy, and evaluate portable mobile x-ray equipment and various alternative power options in an AMPATH operated mobile medical truck in western Kenya, (ii) evaluate the impact on the quality of x-ray images acquired on automated machine-learning based decision making at the point of care and as a triage for radiological analysis, and (iii) supply de-identified x-ray images acquired through this mechanism to the Government. The organization awarded to perform this work must be an AMPATH partner with appropriate agreements (e.g., IRB, currently operating mobile x-ray unit) and relationships in place to purchase and ship medical equipment and related supplies to AMPATH at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), part of Moi University, facilities in Eldoret, Kenya.<br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</strong><br />See attached draft statement of work.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong><br />The period of performance will be for eighteen (18) months from the date of award. The anticipated award date is expected to be on or around September 2018. <br /><br /><em>Other Important Considerations</em><br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. <br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:<br /><br />(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order with Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science, located in East Boothbay, Maine for continuation of work supporting the on-going NOAA project "Chemistry and Toxicity of Heterocyclic Compounds in Petroleum." Beginning in 2015 the principal investigator at Bigelow, Christoph Aeppli, PhD., developed and optimized the protocols for preparation of mixtures of seawater, dispersant, and crude oil for use in toxicity studies on Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitis), conducting novel analyses to characterize them for a targeted set of heterocycle and oxy-hydrocarbon compounds being studied.<br /><br />
<div>In March of 2016 a Sources Sought notice was made public on FedBizOpps.Gov announcing the Government's intent to award on a sole-source basis to Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science.  No responses were received.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sole Source Justification</span><br /></div>
<div>The Government intends to utilize the authority under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements, unless, as a result of this announcement, acceptable responses to this notice are received and a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>During the continued implementation of this project, additional oil weathering, oil-water-dispersant mixture preparation, fractionation, and analytical chemistry services will be required to improve the understanding of the occurrence and bioavailability of polar compounds in oil-contaminated environmental media, which will guide future studies that test hypotheses relating these compounds to toxicity. As the chemist of record for this project, Dr. Aeppli has intimate knowledge of the ongoing study being conducted in collaboration with the Andrew Whitehead, PhD., of the University of California at Davis, and other members of the study team.  Furthermore, it is critical that chemistry testing methodologies be consistent with past and ongoing work, to maintain the continuity and comparability of results obtained over time. Conducting the study using two or more chemistry laboratories would undermine the scientific integrity of the project. The substantial costs of duplication is not expected to be recovered through a competitive process by the Government.</div>
<div>
<p>Interested firms shall submit in writing, their name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding their capability to provide the required chemical mixture preparation, fractionation, and analyses for the project above and also any unique qualifications by 2:00 P.M. CST July 27th, 2018.</p>
<p>In order to be considered, firms must submit pertinent and specific information   on each of the following qualifications. Documentation is limited to 10 pages:</p>
<p>1) Interested firms must provide evidence of experience in the preparation of a variety of forms of water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of oil, seawater, and dispersant; artificial weathering and fractionation and analyses of polar components of oil in seawater (specifically, heterocycle and oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds including naphthenic acids); and preparation of surrogate lipid passive samplers and conducting solid phase micro-extraction, analyzing for these same target compounds);</p>
<p>2) Provide a list of licensed disciplines within the firm qualified in performance these laboratory procedures;</p>

Statement of Work (SOW)
642-18-3-153-0108
1.  Contracting Officer s Representative (COR).   will be provided at award
2.  Contract Title.  Hyperion Image Mass Cytometry (IMC)
3.  Background.
Currently available methods to examine tissue for research are limited in allowing simultaneous visualization of only 1-4 parameters. This hampers research progress. The Hyperion Imaging platform enables the semi-quantitative analysis of over 40 parameters in tissue sections and cell smears without the need for spectral compensation or subtraction of autofluorescent background. This unique spatial and parametric definition of the cells in situ enables understanding of protein behavior and interactions. 
Funding was specifically provided by the VA Office of R&D to procure this instrument for research use.
Note: The C&A requirements do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required. 
4.  Scope. The Hyperion Imaging platform will enable the semi-quantitative analysis of >40 parameters in tissue sections and cell smears without the need for spectral compensation or subtraction of autofluorescent background. The Hyperion Imaging platform is composed of two modules: a Hyperion Tissue Imager and a Hyperion CyTOF system. The Hyperion Tissue Imager liberates antibodies bound to specific proteins of interest in select regions of fixed tissue sections or cell smears and transports them to the Hyperion CyTOF system for analysis. The Hyperion CyTOF system (formerly branded as Helios), is a mass cytometer that employs state-of-the-art Time-of-Flight Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technology in combination with elemental tags that have higher molecular weights than those elements that are naturally abundant in biological systems. In this way, the Hyperion CyTOF has the exquisite ability to simultaneously resolve >40 elemental probes at high acquisition rates without the need for compensation associated with fluorometric techniques, thereby maximizing the data obtained from a single sample in a single experiment.
 Additional unique attributes:
<1 mm ablation spot size of solid tissue, or cells on slides
Up to 52 elemental tags for analysis without re-staining (135 channels available)
Rastering speed of 200 pixels/second
0.3% sensitivity for Tb
Detection limit of 400 antibody copies per mm
Dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude
Automated calibration
7.2TB RAID mirrored data storage
 
 Product Description:
Comprises Hyperion Tissue Imager, Helios Mass Cytometer, Computer and Software. The Hyperion Tissue imager includes Nd:YAG deep UV solid state laser for ablation at 20Hz (tuning only), and 100/200Hz (ablation); Optical system with UV focusing components of laser source to < 1um2 ablation spot size; Ablation chamber with sample slide positioning stages for sub-micron positioning accuracy and Coupling system with tubing connection between the Hyperion Tissue Imager and the Helios for transferring ablated sample streams to the ICP for analysis.
The Helios mass cytometer includes an Inductively coupled plasma ion source with free running RF generator and a balanced load coil interface; 5-stage vacuum system with 2-stage plasma-vacuum interface and TOF turbo-pump; ion-neutral decoupling ion deflector, high-pass ion optic and point-to- parallel focusing lens system; Orthogonal TOF analyzer operated at >75000 spectra/ second TOF cycle frequency; Discrete dynode ion detector; Detection system based on 1 GS/s 8-bit signal dual digitizing boards; Direct sampling spray chamber for individual cell assays; Microconcentric nebulizer; Automatic single sample pneumatic sample loader Auto optimization feature Instrument control and data handling CyTOF MS software.
This high tech instrument will be housed within the Research Building at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VAMC.
Start date: As soon as possible
Length of Service: N/A

<p>These services are provided for eligible employees or applicants who have visual disabilities or other disabilities that may limit their access to printed material (paper or electronically displayed information). An Accommodation Assistant (Reader) provides visual information whether written or displayed that would not otherwise accessible using technology.</p>
<p>Readers must be able to enunciate clearly, accurately, and concisely and must be able to transcribe verbal information accurately. They must have excellent English skills, knowing the differences between commonly mistaken homophones such as their, there, or they're.<br />Readers provide visual descriptions, navigation and sight translations (digital and/or print) to accommodate the employee in performing the essential functions of their job.</p>
<p>Services may include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing visual access to printed or electronically displayed information found in cables, faxes, letters, memoranda, reports, pamphlets, invitations, and meeting notices;<br />&bull; Provide assistance with reading and reviewing hard copy text and electronically displayed information, increasing the font of electronic documents in order for eligible employees with visual needs to be able to view the documents with ease;<br />&bull; Read hard copy texts or electronically displayed information at a rate conducive for an employee to understand the documents and to respond accordingly (for dictation purposes);<br />&bull; Navigating complex vocabulary in reading materials such as foreign names, technical language or specific language or jargon that is specific to the Department of State;<br />&bull; Reading aloud documents exposing errors and/or completeness so that the employee can effectively proofread their work;<br />o This includes exposing errors in punctuation, spelling and/or incomplete fields such as a missing city on a form;<br />&bull; Soliciting guidance from the employee as to how they wish for corrections are to be handled;<br />&bull; Providing sight comparisons between handwritten or printed documents and an electronic version;<br />o This will enable the employee to know if the versions are identical;<br />&bull; Providing visual information to accommodate the employee in navigating unfamiliar software systems, interfaces, templates such as forms or for any training that would not otherwise be accessible.</p>
<p>The Accommodation Assistant performs duties manually or using a variety of technology and/or software packages.

<p>Note: The Accommodation Assistant is not permitted to perform any of the employee's essential or non-essential job duties.</p>
<p>The hallmark of the Accommodation Assistant is that their services are provided autonomously. This means services are provided directly to the eligible employee requiring accessibility. The Accommodation Assistant is required to operate independently demonstrating a high degree of professional autonomy and integrity in their work. The Human Resources (HR) Bureau holds the contract for the Accommodation Assistant yet the majority of the time, services are provided to bureaus outside of HR. This highlights the demand for the Accommodation Assistant to have a strong functional knowledge of how the Department of State functions in order to effectively execute their role. They must also employ a high level of critical thinking skills and techniques to ensure they remain within their role as a support service to the employee instead of as an assistant to the employee.</p>
<p>The Accommodation Assistant must be able to operate within the scope of providing access to the eligible employee. While the position requires knowledge of the Department of State and reasonable accommodations, the performance outcomes resulting from the provision of the reasonable accommodation must accurately reflect the eligible employee's capabilities and not that of the Accommodation Assistant or the employee and the Accommodation Assistant. The Accommodation Assistant shall not interject interpretation, counsel or personal opinion regarding the work being performed; they are simply a reasonable accommodation for the eligible employee to be able to perform the essential functions of their job.</p>
<p>Readers may be required to accompany the Department of State employee to official events, some functions outside the Department to include meetings, conferences, trainings or TDY and serve as a note taker using a laptop or writing comprehensive notes. This position requires travel overseas, and will likely require travel for up to three months or more, with the possibility of a maximum period of up to two years.</p>
<p>Readers may also be required to meet outside of regular business hours, and/or required to work overtime to support mission requirements. There may be periods of time each day that the eligible employee(s) may not require services. Administrative functions, which include data entry, filing, escorting, and electronic document review may be assigned by HR/OAA/DRAD for accomplishment during these period. When this occurs, these duties are secondary and may never take priority over the eligible employee.</p>

<p>***THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THIS RFI IS RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 15.201 FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO SEEK PROPOSALS OR AWARD A CONTRACT AT THIS TIME. ***</p>
<p><br />1. Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. No solicitation is available at this time. The information will be utilized to for FY 19 research purposes.. This Sources Sought is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry. <br /><br />The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is currently in the acquisition planning stage for the eventual award of commercial-off-the-shelf system to track the licensing of Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). The system will enable the SBA to track the progress of applicants through stages of approval/denial over the course of years, as well as enable SBIC license applicants to track their own status.</p>
<p>NAICS 541519 Other Computer Related Services with a small business size standard of Size Standard.$27.5m.</p>
<p>2. Project Background</p>
<p>The United States Small Business Administration ("SBA") was officially established in 1953. Its mission is to maintain and strengthen the nation's economy by aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of small businesses, and by helping families and businesses recover from national disasters. Five years later, the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program was established. Its mission is to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply.</p>
<p>The SBIC Program operates in similar ways to a private equity fund of funds. The SBIC program is a partnership between the public and private sectors in that privately managed investment companies licensed by SBA (SBICs or "funds") supplement private capital with proceeds of debentures guaranteed by SBA with the full faith and credit of the United States (SBA leverage). Once licensed by SBA, an SBIC must invest in U.S. small businesses that meet certain size standards and other criteria set by SBA. There were approximately 301 active SBICs in the SBIC Program with outstanding and committed leverage totaling approximately $14.7 billion as of June 1, 2018.</p>
<p>SBA is seeking to license, configure, and implement a commercial-off-the-shelf ("COTS") system to streamline the way OII manages the license application tracking functions of the SBIC program. Up to 100 SBA staff and 350 external personnel associated with SBIC license applicants would use this system.</p>
<p>The SBIC license application process is managed by a 10-person unit in SBA headquarters. At any given time, roughly 50-60 license applications are at one of the three phases:</p>
<p>&bull; Phase I - Initial application review to enable SBA's Investment Committee to decide whether to provide the applicant a "Green Light" to proceed to phase II; <br />&bull; Phase II - Up to 18 months is allowed for the applicant to raise private capital; <br />&bull; Phase III - Final application receives due diligence, full financial and legal review and is considered for approval first by SBA's Divisional Licensing Committee, and subject to their approval, then by SBA's Agency Licensing Committee. If approved, the license application is considered for final approval by the SBA Administrator.</p>
<p>To meet SBA's unique requirements, the Licensing Tracker solution must have the following features using COTS, with customization only to the extent needed:</p>
<p>SBIC Application Tracking.</p>
<p>&bull; For SBA's internal licensing staff, basic information will be entered by users and reside in the system. This information consists of the dates associated with receipt of a license application, and the dates at which each application moves through the approval process. Prior year data will need to be migrated to the new system. Controls on authorization to change information are essential. Users must be able to access all data via the web.</p>
<p>&bull; For the external applicants, a login function should enable SBIC applicants to track their progress and understand the remaining steps to complete in seeking a license.</p>
<p>SBIC Application Management.</p>
<p>&bull; For SBA managers and internal staff, the ability to generate real time status reports, customizable dynamic dashboards and savable custom reports using all data collected and maintained and automated tasking/reminders is needed. The system must enable end-to-end workflow and task automation, provide the ability to track SBA and SBIC licensing processes and actions requiring SBA approvals and automate performance management metrics. Options for system integration into industry standard CRM and fund-of-funds software platforms will also be considered. &emsp;</p>
<p>&bull; For the external applicants, the ability to submit and store required documentation in a Virtual Data Room is highly desirable.</p>
<p>c) Analysis.</p>
<p>&bull; For SBA users, the system must generate summary statistics to be generated in real time.</p>
<p>&bull; For external applicants, the system must generate information via dashboards to show the aggregate SBIC licensing activity, volume of applications, and time associated with the various approval steps, drawing on prior year averages.</p>
<p>d) Document Management.</p>
<p>For both SBA users and external applicants, a central document repository is highly desirable to make information on each license application immediately available, with email notifications provided to all users when information has been changed/updated. The system should include a centralized repository for documents with tools available for uploading and downloading documents. Features must include document versioning, document meta tagging, customizable web-based forms for upload and downloading; electronic signatures; archival and backup capabilities.</p>
<p>3. Industry Response</p>
<p>Any interested firm should submit a Capability Statement that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the Government's Objectives. The Capability Statement should be no longer than six pages and a slide deck no longer than ten slides. The submission should include:</p>
<p>&bull; Past projects of similar type and scope and, where applicable, the contract name, the contracting agency, the total contract value, the period of performance, and a description of how the project relates to the work described in this Sources Sought.<br />&bull; SBA Small Business Category, if applicable.<br />&bull; General Services Administration (GSA) Supply Schedule Number, if applicable. <br />&bull; DUNS Number.<br />&bull; Point(s) of contact for your firm, including e-mail address and phone number.</p>
<p><br />The Government will review the Capability Statement to determine if the interested firm is capable of satisfying the requirements listed in part 3 and part 4 of this Sources Sought Notice. <br /><br />Please note that a small business firm may submit a capability statement that includes the expertise of large business partner companies under a teaming arrangement. If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, then the response to this source sought must clearly discuss the areas that the small business firm intends to perform and the specific areas that the large business teaming partner intends to perform. Please note that at least 50% of the total cost of all services provided must be incurred by or for personnel of the small business firm pursuant to the FAR clause at 52.219-14 entitled "Limitations on Subcontracting (JAN 2017)". <br /><br />SBA reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested firm in any manner SBA determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response. However, if an interested firm must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked, and the interested firm must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary. SBA will review the information and safeguard it appropriately. The Government will not pay for any information that is provided in response to this Sources Sought/RFI nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. <br /><br />SBA personnel may contact firms responding to this announcement to clarify a responder's capabilities and other matters as part of this market research process.</p>

<CONTACT>Shalunda S. Mix, Contract Specialist, Phone 662-686-5346, Fax 662-686-5373, Email shalunda.mix@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent: The USDA, ARS, WBSC intends to award a sole source procurement to Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems, 2395 Apopka Blvd., Apopka, FL, 32703, USA, for a VAKI Nano Fish Counter as they are the sole source for this type of fry size fish counter, pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(l ) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The award will be for 1 (one), VAKI Nano Fish Counter capable of counting very small (as small as 0.05gram) size catfish. The counter will be used in research to accurately count fry-size catfish while they remain in water as they are being stocked into different research studies. This is expansion and continuation of on-going genetics and breeding research in this project area. The counter must be of the general design which allows for very small (fry) size fish to be counted with equal to or greater than 99% accuracy while they remain in water. Although there are other designs of fish counters, to our knowledge there are none that can count this size (0.05 gram) fry with this degree of accuracy, and because of current animal welfare protocols that USDA must adhere to, do so as quickly (up to 200,000 fish per hour) while the fish remain in water.
<p><br />The Government intends to award a firm fixed price Purchase Order on or about July 26, 2018 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This Notice of Intent is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will consider all responses received by 2:00 PM Central Time July 25, 2018 Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted via mail to the Contracting Officer at the following address:</p>

<p>The proposed USD 350,000,000 Mongolia Water Compact addresses one of the country's most binding constraints to economic growth: costly access to water and sanitation. The Compact will assist the Government in meeting the projected demand for water in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar for residential consumers and commercial and industrial users through three closely related investment activities:<br />&bull; A Downstream Wells Activity, to construct new groundwater wells with attendant transmission lines, reservoirs, and an advanced water treatment plant (subject of this procurement notice);<br />&bull; A Wastewater Recycling Activity, to construct a new wastewater recycling plant and pipelines to provide high-quality treated wastewater that can be used instead of fresh water by water-intensive industries, thereby increasing the amount of fresh water available for household consumption; and<br />&bull; A Water Sector Sustainability Activity, to support policy reforms, capacity building, and technical assistance to improve the long-term sustainability of Ulaanbaatar's water supply.</p>
<p>The Government has authorized the National Secretariat for the Development of the Second Compact Agreement between the Government of Mongolia and the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (the "National Secretariat"), a unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to conduct a procurement for the preparation of detailed designs, an environmental and social impact assessment ("ESIA") and resettlement action plan ("RAP") related to the Downstream Wells Activity on its behalf. At a later date, the Government expects to establish an accountable entity, MCA-Mongolia, to assume certain responsibilities from the National Secretariat and to oversee implementation of the Compact.</p>
<p>The Government intends to apply a part of the grant to contracts for goods, works and services. Any payments made by the National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia under the proposed contracts will be subject, in all respects, to the terms and conditions of the Compact and related documents, including restrictions on the use and distribution of MCC Funding. No party other than the Government and the National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia shall derive any rights from the Compact or have any claim to the proceeds of MCC Funding.</p>
<p>The request for proposals ("RFP") follows a General Procurement Notice that appeared in dgMarket on July 9, 2018, UNDB Online on July 9, 2018, and local newspapers Today on July 9, 2018 and National post on July 9, 2018.</p>
<p>The National Secretariat now invites proposals from legally constituted consulting firms to provide the consultant services referenced above ("Proposals").</p>
<p>The RFP is open to all eligible entities ("Consultants") who meet the minimum qualifications and wish to respond. Consultants may associate with other consultants to enhance their capacity to successfully carry out the assignment, subject to restrictions noted in the RFP.</p>
<p>Mongolian law requires a firm and its relevant principal consultants (e.g., hydrogeologist, hydrologist and environmental specialist) to hold applicable active local license for the purpose of submitting Detailed Designs and ESIA for Government approval. If a Consultant does not possess its own license(s), it may require a partner or sub-consultant with the applicable, active license(s). Each Consultant shall include information on its qualifications of the licensed partner(s) and copies of the required licenses in its Work Plan. The National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia may reject any Work Plan that does not meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The consultant services, and the contract expected to be awarded, are divided into the following two broad categories:<br />1. Detailed Design services up to completion of construction bidding documents; and<br />2. Following the submission of the detailed design, the Consultant will need to be available on an as needed basis until the end of the construction phase.</p>
<p>A Consultant will be selected under the Quality and Cost Based Selection ("QCBS") method. The evaluation procedure for this method is described in sections of the RFP in accordance with the MCC Program Procurement Guidelines, which are available on MCC's website (www.mcc.gov/ppg). The evaluation procedure, as described, will include a review and verification of qualifications and past performance, including a reference check, prior to the contract award.</p>
<p>The RFP includes the following Sections:</p>
<p>PART 1 - PROPOSAL AND SELECTION PROCEDURES<br />Section I Instructions to Consultants <br />This section provides information to help potential Consultants prepare their Proposals; it also provides information on the submission, opening, and evaluation of Proposals and on the award of the proposed contract.</p>

<p>Section III Qualification and Evaluation Criteria<br />This section specifies the qualifications required of the Consultant and the criteria to be used to evaluate the Proposal.</p>

<p>Section V Terms of Reference<br />This Section includes the detailed Terms of Reference that describe the nature, tasks, and duties of the consulting services to be procured.</p>
<p>PART 2 - CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT AND CONTRACT FORMS<br />Section VI Contract Agreement and General Conditions of Contract<br />This section contains the form of Contract proposed to be entered into between the National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia and Consultant.</p>
<p>Section VII Special Conditions of Contract and Annexes to Contract<br />This section contains the form of those clauses of the Contract that supplement the GCC and that are to be completed by The National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia for each procurement of Consulting Services. This section also includes an Annex to the Contract (Annex B: Additional Provisions) that contains provisions that are a part of the Government's and the National Secretariat/MCA-Mongolia's obligations under the Compact and related documents which, under the terms of the Compact and related documents, are required to be transferred onto any Consultant, Sub-Consultant or Associate who partakes in any MCC-funded procurement.</p>
<p>Please note that a Pre-Proposal Conference will be held as described in the Proposal Data Sheet ("PDS") in Section II of the RFP.</p>

Marel scales use a single point load cell, a heavy duty main load cell protected by pre-tensioned springs to increase durability and is equipped with a secondary load cell. The weighing pan is removable for cleaning purposes. The built-in motion compensation is for use on board vessels at sea. The PL2262 platform is intended for medium to low-capacity benchtop applications. The platform is of solid build and can withstand extreme environmental conditions at sea. Platform legs are able to raise the unit off the deck to minimize abuse from seawater; the platform also has tall sides to eliminate saltwater intrusion from heavy seas. The M1100 PL2262 indicator is mounted directly on the platform front for easy to read display. All exposed surfaces are constructed of AISI 316 stainless steel and meet EPA IEC 529-IP69K waterproof standards which is necessary for the extreme marine environment observers experience while deployed on commercial fishing vessels. The M1100 PL2262 is able to capture a weight range from 5g to 36kg to measure a full standard orange basket used throughout the commercial fishing industry. The scales also have a RS-232 bi-directional interface, 4800 baud, 8 data pits and no parity. They are equipped with Bluetooth LTE that communicates with the Android operating system, which is used by the NEFOP for mobile data collection at-sea. The calibration weights are used by all observers who are trained to calibrate the scale and are required to document the calibration weight value on their observer logs. The observers are also required to submit a log to document the calibration of the scale, fit value and daily test comments. The NEFOP has a scale service contract with Marel, Seattle Inc. for calibration, maintenance, repairs and part replacement of the scales at a high level service. The Marel technician comes on site to work on the scales, avoiding shipping damage to scalesThe statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source. <br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 811219 with a business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>

<a href="mailto:maggie.uriostigue@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), 2.0 Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Navy Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO-EIS), Navy Commercial Cloud Services (NCCS) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Kros-Wise, Inc., located in San Diego, CA for program and financial management support for NCCS.  The requirement is currently being fulfilled under Kros-Wise task order N0017807-D-5128-NS03.  The prospective award is based on the authority for other than full and open competition found at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Kros-Wise, Inc. is the contractor that currently possesses the historic and operational knowledge to enable Department of Navys transition from the Data Center Optimization and Applications Office (DCAO) to PEO-EIS NCCS.  The required efforts cannot be performed by any other source other than Kros-Wise, Inc. without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and without Kros-Wise service delivery, unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements will be experienced.  Kros-Wise, Inc. will be supporting transition of Navy customers to the Cloud, and standup of the NCCS project office.  Solicitation N00039-18-R-0105 is anticipated to be issued and subsequently awarded in Fiscal Year 2018.  The prospective award is planned to be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract with a one-year base period plus one six-month option, and an estimated cost of approximately $6 million.  The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis. However, in an effort to foster competition, any prospective offeror may provide relevant information, by the requested due date below, which the Government may consider in its continued review of the sole source nature of this requirement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price sole source purchase order on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to Ajinomoto Althea, LLC. located at 11040 Roselle St., San Diego, CA 92121-1205, under the authority as prescribed in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), only one source reasonably available that will satisfy agency requirements. This requirement is for the extension of stability testing</p>
<p>Althea Inc. is currently under contract (W81XWH-13-P-0274) to manufacture two Bulk Drug Substances (BDS) and test the long term stability of the BDS while stored at -20C. These BDS are currently being used in multiple clinical trials to test the efficacy of DNA vaccines and gain FDA approval. A new contract is required to continue the storage and stability testing.</p>
<p>To maintain the integrity of the stability testing it is critical that the current contractor continue the testing under a new contract. Shipping the products to a new contractor will involve placing them at a different temperature which will have unknown effects and also risks getting lost/delayed in transit. Based on previous contracts, the initial set up of a storage and stability program will be significantly higher in cost than simply revising and continuing the program with the current contractor. <br /><br />This is a notice of intent to issue this solicitation on a sole source basis. This notice of intent is NOT a request for quotations (RFQ). Any other firms desiring consideration must fully identify their interest and capability to provide these services no later than August 2nd, 2018 to the individual listed below. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested persons may identify their interest in writing, to the Government point of contact. Responses to this notice must be received no later than 11:00am Eastern Standard Time, August 2nd, 2018.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command, Global Combat Support System Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) intends to extend the ordering period of contract M67854-17-D-7609 with Oracle America, Inc., which was orignially awarded by SPAWAR&nbsp;Atlantic under contract&nbsp;N65236-17-D-1005 on 21 December 2016 by one (1) year.&nbsp; The original contract was continued under the current number (M67854-17-D-7609) with the same terms and conditions.<br /><br />The extension will allow support&nbsp;to GCSS-MC&nbsp;to continue through the transition in time expected after the resulting contract is awarded for solicitation M67854-18-R-7600.<br /><br />Because the ceiling for contract M67854-17-D-7609 is being used at a rate faster than anticipated when the contract was awarded, we intend to increase the contract ceiling to a maximum of $92.9M from the current $47M ceiling.<br /><br />If an industry partner feels they can perform the sustainment support at the full performance level&nbsp;on short notice, please email the contacts.

Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>

<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The <br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Key Personnel, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. The non-price factors 1-3 are listed in descending order of importance. All non-price factors, individually and when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: The government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated the technical capability to successfully perform these services, and demonstrated a feasible technical approach to successfully perform and manage the required tasks while ensuring that all deliverable schedule requirements are met.</p>
<p>Key Personnel: The Government will evaluate the proposed Key Personnel to determine how qualified they are to perform the tasks detailed in the SOW. The Government will evaluate <br />the resume of the offeror's proposed key personnel, to determine the extent to which they have performed work similar to the current requirement; and the extent to which their education, training, qualifications and experience indicate that they will successfully perform the roles for which they are proposed.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance for work completed or substantially completed within the last five (5) years to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>NOTE -- If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; however, an offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the Experience Factor.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>

<p><strong>Basis for Award / Evaluation</strong></p>

Quotes that are not technically acceptable will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make a single award without conducting "discussions" as defined in FAR Part 15. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact the quoter (or multiple quoters) to request quotation revisions that seek additional price discounts, provide revisions to the technical quotation or explain other aspects of the quotation to improve the terms of the deal reflected in the quotation. In the event quotation revisions are requested, the Government will not necessarily be seeking revisions from all quoters. The Government may reject any or all quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.</p>

<p><br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p><br />(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on July 27, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIII) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.<br />(XIV)  Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 5 P.M. MST on July 27th, 2018.  All quotes must be emailed or faxed to the attention of Ryan Stroud. The email address is ryan.stroud@noaa.gov, and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(c) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
