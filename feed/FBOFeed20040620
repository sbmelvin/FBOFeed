<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to the Presolicitation Notice issued on 4 JUN 04 is to announce that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), through the Contracts Management Office (CMO), hereby formally issues Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HR0011-04-R-0001, for the Optically Designated Attack Munitions (ODAM) Program.  All qualified and capable sources, consistent with the terms and conditions of the RFP and all associated attachments, are encouraged to respond.  Proposals are due no later than 16:00 (4:00pm) Arlington, VA LOCAL TIME on 4 AUG 04.

Proposers are cautioned to read the RFP and all associated attachments in their entirety.  Compliant proposals, consistent with the terms and conditions of the RFP, will be evaluated in accordance with the SECTION M criteria specified.  SECTION M evaluation criteria include the following:  Criterion 1:  Technical realism and viability/Realistic and Supported Performance Metrics;  (NOTE:  Criterion 1 consists of Criterion 1A – Realistic and Supported Performance Metrics, and Criterion 1B – Assessment of Risk); Criterion 2:  Realistic and Supported Cost-per-Unit Estimated Production Cost; Criterion 3:  Realistic and Supported Program Cost; Criterion 4:  Realistic and Supported Program Schedule; Criterion 5:  Management Evaluation; and Criterion 6:  Past Performance.  Criterion 1, 2, 3, and 4 are of equal weight, and are each worth 22% of the total score.  Criterion 5 and 6 are of significantly lower weight than Criterion 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Criterion 5 is worth 9% of the total score, and Criterion 6 is worth 3% of the total score.  Successful proposals should incorporate a balanced approach that responds to all six of the evaluation criteria.  Each of the six criteria will be rated based on numerical scores from 0 to 100.  The overall weighted score, as discussed above, will be assigned to offerors proposals based on the Government’s assessment of the offerors proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.215-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS – COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (JAN 2004), Paragraph (f), The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Paragraph (f)(2), the Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.  DARPA, reserves the right under this solicitation, therefore, to select none, one, or up to two contract awards under this RFP.  In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Paragraph (f)(4), the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

All representations, certifications, and other statements of offerors listed in SECTION K require contractor completion.  SECTION K information should be forwarded as part of an offeror’s proposal submission.  This information will not be counted against offerors with respect to any proposal page limitations imposed by the RFP.  

The ODAM Program is a technology development and integration effort to demonstrate a low cost optical seeker for converting a 60mm mortar into a precision guided munitions system.  It is anticipated that these systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in providing small unit of operations with cost effective organic precision indirect fires capable of operating across the full gamut of environments including grassland, desert, arctic, and urban.  DARPA believes that the desired performance and cost characteristics can be achieved by the combination of innovative design and integration of existing and developmental technologies, resulting in a guidance package fuze system that is “plug compatible” with existing munitions.  Examples of technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  LED alternatives to laser designators, uncooled photodetector technology (daytime and nighttime alternatives), design alternatives for compact optics, etc.  Only those designs meeting minimum standards, as set forth in the RFP, will be considered.  These minimums include, but are not limited to, the following:  4-meter CEP static; daytime and nighttime operation; contact fuze, 100-meter steering range; production cost (lot size 30,000 units) less than $500; and a program schedule not-to-exceed 30 months.  The ultimate goal of the program is deployment of the guidance package fuze system mortar with U.S. troops as a retrofit for the existing 60mm mortar ammunition.  The program will be divided into three phases including Preliminary and Critical Design, Brassboard Fabrication and Optimization, and Field Test and Demonstration.  Further details are provided in the RFP.

Proposer’s may view the DARPA ATO ODAM website at http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm for information associated with this RFP, including a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and answers.  DARPA may communicate items of interest through this website, therefore interested parties are encouraged to review this website for periodic updates.  Questions pertaining to this announcement should be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer delineated below, Email:  acicala@darpa.mil, with a copy to ODAM-RFP@darpa.mil.
