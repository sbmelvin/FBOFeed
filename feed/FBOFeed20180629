In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be approximately 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.   Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer William J. Stephenson, 405-739-9077, william.stephenson.4@us.af.mil.

This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.&nbsp; The Government is requesting inputs/feedback.<br /></strong><br />The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Remote Sensing Systems Directorate (SMC/RS)&nbsp;intends to&nbsp;solicit proposals through the use of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (see FAR 35.016) to identify innovative concepts and designs for a Next-Gen Overhead Persistant Infrared (OPIR) Block-I payload and a derivative prototype payload.<br /><br />In developing Next Gen Block-0, the government will prioritize schedule, driving the space vehicle design to incorporate high technology readiness components in order to minimize the program's schedule risk. In parallel, SMC/RS will begin exploring payload concepts for the follow-on system, Next-Gen OPIR Block-I. The initial launch capability (ILC) goal for Block-I is 2030.</p>
<p><br />Under the FINAL&nbsp;announcement, the Government seeks to identify what performance and resiliency parameters are achievable with component technologies currently under development that may not be incorporated into the Block-0 design due to current technical maturity levels and development schedules. Offerors will be asked to develop a set of feasible Block-I system requirements based on technology readiness assumptions, which will provide feedback to the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) development process.</p>
<p>Based on these requirements, offerors shall develop achievable Next Generation Block-I payload concepts, along with an early prototype version of the proposed concept. Prototype payload concepts shall incorporate advanced component technologies as well as threat mitigation components and techniques to reduce Block-I payload development time, assembly and integration risk, mature component technology/ manufacturing readiness levels (TRL/MRL), and inform future Missile Warning and Missile Defense (MW/MD) architecture and Concept of Operations (CONOPs). The results of this announcement shall inform the scalability of the prototype concept to enable the transition of capabilities, technology and CONOPS to the Next Generation OPIR Block-I Program of Record (PoR).</p>
<p>Associated with this solicitation, the OPIR Advanced Development Branch is requesting industry's written feedback on the BAA and will answer any clarifying questions by potential offerors. The deadline for question submittal will be 4 June 2018. Questions and answers will be compiled and distributed (non-attribution/anonymous) via FBO. Interested offerors shall direct any questions regarding this announcement to the points of contact listed in section 11.</p>
<p>This DRAFT announcement contains sensitive and classified reference documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents will be provided upon request and after clearance verification.&nbsp; For clearance verification please submit&nbsp;your Company name, website, Federal Tax ID, CAGE Code, DUNS number and mailing address, along with your technical, security and administrative points of contact (including email addresses (unclassified, SECRET, TS/SCI), and telephone number) to the primary and&nbsp;secondary points of contact identified above. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />PROGRAMMATICS: <br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, Mr. James Tisdale, Phone Number (310) 653-1889, mailing address SMC/PKX, Attn: Mr. James Tisdale, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90245-2808. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/SMC ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2395, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br /><strong>DECLARATION: This is a DRAFT announcement.&nbsp; This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

The short-listed offerors will be announced by special notice to the Federal Business Opportunities website. Offerors may be contacted separately to request their approval.  In Step 2 of the selection procedure, short listed firms shall submit additional project experience to show the qualifications of their entire team. They will also submit their technical and management approach to a sample project, along with resumes for additional Key Personnel, and pricing information. In addition, oral presentations and site visits to offeror facilities will be held.</p>

<DESC><p>PURPOSE: This requirement is in support of the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, &amp; Instrumentation (PEO STRI) in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC). The Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, Threat Simulators and Special Operations Forces Training Systems (PM ITTS) has a requirement for National Cyber Range II (NCR II).</p>
<p>ACQUISITION APPROACH: The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC - Orlando), anticipates that NCR II program requirements will be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract award to Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems Division (CAGE 16331), 100 Global Innovation Circle, Orlando, FL 32825-5002. The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) intends to pursue a sole source award of the NCR II requirements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND: On 26 May 2014, Contract W9000KK-14-C-0020, a CPFF contract, was awarded sole source to Lockheed Martin for National Cyber Range (NCR), with a period of performance up to 5-years (1 year base with 4 option years). The NCR is a one-of-a-kind capability providing secure facilities, computing resources, repeatable processes and a skilled workforce as a service to Program Managers (PMs) and Cyber Mission Force (CMF) organizations. Performance based services include cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and training as a service to DoD customers. NCR benefits PM and CMF planning and execution of a wide range of cyber activities, including science and technology experimentation, architectural evaluations, security control assessments, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments, adversarial assessments, training, exercises, and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Market research conducted by TRMC and ACC-Orlando in support of the upcoming National Cyber Range Complex Event Planning, Operations and Support (NCRC EPOS) competitive procurement indicated that prospective Offerors require key technical documentation to effectively prepare proposals for the NCRC EPOS solicitation. Pursuant to FAR 52.217-8, the PCO at ACC-Orlando determined extending NCR services for 6-months is necessary for completion of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and delivery of a current Technical Data Package (TDP) by 25 November 2019.</p>
<p>This NCR II sole source contract will provide the Government a risk mitigation strategy for continuation of service at the only single operational location while the NCRC EPOS requirements package are being prepared and key technical documents for the NCR are being developed. It is the Government's intent to exercise only the necessary option years required of this NCR II sole source FFP/CPFF contract to meet the risk mitigation objectives listed below:</p>
<p>Continuation of the current critical cyber service;</p>
<p>Operational contingency to mitigate risks in the event of any facility build out schedule slippages, accreditation schedule slippages, or NCRC EPOS delays/protests;</p>
<p>To allow needed time for NCRC EPOS performers to ramp-up;</p>
<p>Training package development/delivery to train new NCRC EPOS performers;</p>
<p>TDP Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) to ensure system reproducibility at future new NCRC sites, and;</p>
<p>Risk Management Framework Assessment and Authorization to reach Approval to Operate (ATO).</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY: Not to exceed 48 months after award of contract.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REQUESTED: Contractors who believe they have the ability to meet the NCR II requirements shall submit an affirmative, written response, not to exceed 10 pages, indicating their ability to meet the specific NCR II requirements outlined above.</p>
<p>The Offeror's capability description should include documentation demonstrating that the Offeror has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them; considers all existing commercial and governmental business commitments; has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them; and has the necessary technical and management resources and facilities, or the ability to obtain them.</p>
<p>If the Government decides to compete this requirement, a synopsis shall be issued. If this effort becomes a Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting, will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they intend to comply.</p>
<p>Responses should appear on company letterhead and include any applicable pricing data or information. All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number and an e-mail address. Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned. Responses shall be furnished electronically to the contacts listed below, not later than 3:00 PM EDT, July 14th, 2018.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products and services. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable of satisfying PEO STRI/TRMC requirements for NCR II. A determination not to compete the proposed NCR II requirement(s) based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to e-Control Systems, Inc. for the purchase of an integrated hardware and software system for temperature monitoring compliant with CDC's Quality Management System (QMS). The package that e-Controls provides is the only option that provides an integrated system of temperature monitoring hardware and software to store temperature readings, provide automated alerts based on those readings, and a user-interface for viewing and maintaining the information with fine-grained control on user access while meeting OCSIO requirements for network and data security. The system also meets the requirements of being a single system for monitoring hundreds of pieces of equipment distributed across multiple rooms and buildings, and being scalable for additional equipment and locations within DVBD. Additionally, e-Controls meets OCISO's requirements for network and data security, including: 1) wireless data transmission with an encryption algorithm, 2) data storage in an approved and regularly backed-up and scanned relational database management system, and 3) a user-interface which passes OCISO's regular security scans. This system is linked to and compatible with the Laboratory's existing network and does not require additional software; compatibility with the Laboratory's system is critical for successful operation. Finally, this system has been vetted and is compliant with CDC security, which is required before implementation in the Laboratory. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp; Stroke (NINDS) Section intends to solicit by a request for quotation from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center for award on or around July 17, 2018. The purpose of this purchase order will be to provide the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) with NK cell function analysis on samples sent from NIH as part of a current study.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE and SET ASIDE STATUS<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code&nbsp;621511 with a Size Standard of $32.5.</p>
<p>This acquisition is NOT set aside for small businesses.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source provides that: For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, Contracting officers may solicit from one source IF the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name OR industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-98 dated May 31, 2018.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT/PURPOSE <br />Blood samples from 21 study participants have already been collected, sent, and analyzed by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Diagnostic Immunology Laboratory. This represents half of the healthy volunteers and a quarter of the ME/CFS participants that will be enrolled in the protocol. <br /><br />The contractor will receive individual blood samples shipped from NIH. The contractor will perform NK cell function analysis on the samples within a 24 hour time window required for proper testing. The contractor will provide results by fax within 7 business days.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Specific Requirements are as follows:<br />1. Using chromium release methodology, natural Killer cells (NK cells), obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, are assayed for the ability to lyse target cells at four different effectors: target (E: T) ratios. Lytic units are a calculated measure based on the cytotoxicity results. CD16/56 (NK Cell) percentage of the mononuclear cell preparation is measured and reported to confirm the presence of NK Cells in the plated sample.</p>
<p>2. The laboratory shall be regulated under CLIA as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical laboratory testing. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.</p>
<p>3. The contractor will receive individual blood samples shipped from NIH. The contractor shall perform NK cell function analysis on the samples within a 24 hour time window required for proper testing.</p>
<p>4. The contractor will provide results by fax within 7 business days.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall receive a minimum of 15 blood samples for testing annually to include Government options for 4 additional years for a total of up to 5 years. The Government has the option to increase this quantity in increments of 5 samples (3 options to add 5 samples) within each year of the contract.</p>
<p>6. All final reports will be reviewed by a medical doctor for accuracy before delivery to the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Heritage University is the only vendor in the marketplace that can provide the services required by NINDS.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Specifically, a sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps referencing the above detailed requirements and no responses were received. Additionally, contacts with knowledgeable individuals both in industry and Government revealed no other sources. Because of the importance for consistent data with no test variation - it is essential to utilize Cincinnati Children's Hospital to conduct future testing as part of the current study. Using more than one NK cell function testing vendor will allow technical variation between laboratories to confound the study results, making future measurements unreliable. Therefore, only Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center<br />3333 Burnet Ave<br />Cincinnati, OH 45229</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.</p>
