<CONTACT>Rashida S. Ferebee, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014352605, Email ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Cisbio Bioassays US, 135 South Road, Bedford, MA, 01730 for the procurement of three (3) Phospho Akt (ser473) - 50,000 tests.<br /><br />The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Cisbio Bioassays US does not distribute this item to any other resellers; as such, Cisbio Bioassays US is the sole provider of this particular reagent. Additionally, the pSer473 AKT HTRF&reg; Cisbio assay consists of reagents labeled proprietary fluorophores. Akt is an important kinase enzyme involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation and differentiation. Phosphorylation of AKT at the amino acid Ser473 is a critical regulatory step of AKT activity. NCGC has done extensive work to miniaturize the assay to 1536-well format and demonstrated that it produces robust data using the HTS capabilities at NCGC by doing pilot screens with small compound collections. The current HTRF&reg; Cisbio assay is ready for HTS at NCGC. At this moment, there is no alternative assay available to measure pSer473 AKT that would allow NCGC to screen of a large collection of compounds (400,000). NCGC must use the same variables in the assays to maintain integrity from the data and to achieve the desired outcomes. This item has been purchased in the past from this vendor only, as no one else can provide these specific reagents. All the assay optimization was performed with the HTRF&reg; kits. Going forward, the screening needs to be done with the same reagents in order to yield comparable and readily interpretable results. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay with no guarantees that the results would be similar. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 333999, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by January 9, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.<br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHGRI-CSB-(HG)-2012-050-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee. Response may be submitted electronically to Rashida.ferebee@nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This notice is for Market Research purposes only, not a request for quotations or solicitation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, 8(a) certified small businesses, woman owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses as well as small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors that can provide the services and supplies described below. All parties may respond to this synopsis.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a small business standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>Millions of vascular stents are inserted into patients every year and a significant percentage of these are prematurely failing because of material fracture. Also, a number of drug-eluting stents have experienced coating problems such as cracking and peeling away from the stent struts resulting in unacceptable biological responses. Furthering understanding of the fracture of materials and thin surface coatings commensurate with development of test methods for evaluating fractures and coating defects in metal devices (starting with vascular stents) will advance regulatory science and improve medical product safety.</p>
<p>As a part of an FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) approved collaborative stent project between the FDA ORA Winchester Engineering and Analytical Center (WEAC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), there is a need to have stents implanted into porcine coronary arteries (up to three coronary arteries per animal) to determine and understand the conditions that lead to stent fractures and the vascular responses to these fractures. In September, 2011, the FDA contracted with CBSET, Inc. of Lexington, MA to conduct Phase 1 of the stent study. The subject of this market research is for Phases 2 and 3 of the same study.</p>
<p>The Health assessment and interventional services must be performed by a company in close proximity to WEAC and MIT (located within a 15 minute drive).</p>
<p>Services required include:</p>
<p>. Tissue Perfusion and Fixation<br />. Radiographs<br />. Histomorphometry<br />. Histology<br />. Histopathology<br />. Deliverable (report)<br />. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol Development<br />. Study Protocol Development<br />. Animal Purchase Acclimation and Pre-Study Health Assessment<br />. Operating Room Hospital Grade Catheter Lab<br />. Interventional procedure<br />. Fluoroscopy and Quantitative Angiography<br />. Housing Husbandry Animal Care<br />. Antiplatelet Therapy<br />. Clinical Pathology Blood Sampling<br />. Necropsy<br />. Assessment Deliverables (Report)</p>
<p>In addition, the following supplies are required:</p>
<p>. Vision stents, pre-mounted on balloon delivery system, quantity of 100<br />. Remounting on balloons and Ethylene Oxide (ETO) sterilization post fracture, quantity 30</p>
<p>Funding for this project is contingent upon the availability of Fiscal 2012 funds.</p>
<p>Potential contractors must indicate business size (Note NAICS above), proof of any set-aside certification and company's DUNS number and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number and email address of point of contact. Capability statement must provide enough information to determine if company can meet requirements stated above by including technical specifications, descriptive literature, brochures and other information that demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirements. Provide two contact names, email and phone numbers for users of the proposed products that may be contacted by the Government. Identify availability under GSA contract if applicable.</p>
<p>Responses are due in person, by postal mail or by email to the point of contact listed below on or before January 12, 2012, 1:00 CST at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OM/OAGS, Attn: Marcia Park, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-322, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502. Reference 1098224.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this posting shall be submitted via email or fax no later than 1:00 PM CST, January 9, 2012.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by the respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to provide the services and supplies described. Respondents are advised the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of any information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in a resultant solicitation that may result from this market survey.</p>

5.	Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requiring Use of the Authority Cited: Gyrus is the sole developer and distributor of the Visera System products.

6.	Solicitation of Potential Resources:   The services will be made known through the announcement on FedBizOpps, the government point of entry. It will be announced as intent to sole source; however, contractors in the industry may submit their capabilities. Gyrus remains the only manufacturer of the Visera system.

c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:  N/A
	
10.	Action That may be Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition
The action to be taken to overcome barriers to competition ranges from extremely limited to no existing action. Since Gyrus has the proprietary interest and sole distribution rights to this system, there appears to be no action that can be taken to thwart competitive barriers.

11.	Delivery Requirements:  Provide replacement Visera System Equipment, with a trad-in allowance, to the Cincinnati VA Medical Center.


The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification and approval for the aforementioned services for a complete drug infusion system have been prepared by:

<DESC>VA69D-12-Q-0190; Intent to Sole Source Contract Award
Interim Contract for Hines Ambulance Services
Jason Rathsack, Contract Specialist, NCO 12 GLAC
12/29/2011

The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a 6-month sole source contract award with Vandenberg Ambulance Services, Tinley Park, IL, to provide ALS and BLS Ambulance Services for the Hines VA Hospital under the authority of (1) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2)).  The 6-month period is necessary to conduct a competitive acquisition for a longer term contract.  If you are interested in bidding on this requirement, please submit your information on a sources sought notification posted on FBO at:

FBO NOTICE
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=ea592c348665aa844e70ff9f6fd9552c&tab=core&_cview=0

Technical Scope:  Contractor shall provide labor, equipment, and material necessary to provide advanced life support, medical intensive care unit support, and basic life support ambulance transportation for Hines VA and affiliated CBOCS.  Transportation includes but is not limited to one way trips between VA facilities, resident to VA facility, VA to affiliated hospitals, VA to the morgue, respiratory ventilator transportation and all associated labor, equipment, and supplies necessary to assure patient safety.

Requirements:   Contractor is required to respond to any call within 15 minutes.  Contractor personnel are required to complete background investigations as determined by the VA Privacy Office prior to beginning work.  Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) providing emergency service on ambulances under this contract must have completed training in accordance with the standards published by the Department of Health and Human Services with a minimum curriculum of 150 hours or equivalent including an in-hospital training period.  Such training programs must also be acceptable under the regulating requirements for local EMS Systems supported by DHHS under PL 93-154, Federal Register 39:24304 (1974).  EMTs shall be certified, licensed or otherwise officially recognized by the local, state or regional government or public entity where the emergency ambulance service is operated or by which it is governed.  Ambulance drivers shall have a valid operator's or chauffeur's license in accordance with Federal, State and local government requirements for their place of operation, for the services they perform, be capable of administering oxygen and have successfully completed the Standard and Advanced First Aid Course of the American Red Cross or U.S. Bureaus of Mines or equivalent and be capable of providing necessary medical assistance to the attending medical care specialist.

POP: January 11, 2011 through July 11, 2012

Justification:  Advanced life support, medical intensive care unit support, and basic life support ambulance transportation services and all associated equipment are vital to the operations of the VA Medical Center.  Conversion to a new vendor without a transitional period would be disruptive and put both operations and patient's lives at considerable risk.  Significant additional time and costs are required for properly competing, awarding, transitioning and reconfiguring procedures while ensuring that patient safety is not put at risk.  Awarding a new contract would take approximately 6 months to properly conduct the acquisition process and transition.  All nursing stations, patient wards, doctors, transportation personnel, and fiscal would be required to change processes and procedures that were setup with the incumbent contractor.  

NCO 12 is currently in the process of performing market research to determine the best strategy for garnering competition.  The VA will need approximately 6 months to properly compete these services and allow for the successful conversion to a potential new contractor.  If interested and qualified to bid on the requirement, please visit the sources sought posted on FBO at:
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=ea592c348665aa844e70ff9f6fd9552c&tab=core&_cview=0.

To prevent disruption of the current service, a short-term sole source to the incumbent Blackhawk Medical Transportation Inc. dba Vandenberg Ambulance is required until a long-term contract is put into place, pursuant to acquisition regulations. 

Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by January 6, 2012. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement by January 11, 2012; these will be evaluated by the government. A determination by the government not to open the interim requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation documents are available and no telephone request will be honored.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the agency. <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a U.S.-based training program ("TR") related to the proposed Transnet Management and Operations Development Program in South Africa ("Host Country").</p>
<p>To meet rising demand in South Africa's rapidly growing rail transportation sector, the Grantee - a large South African rail, port, and pipeline company that is majority owned by the Government of South Africa - is engaged in massive capital investments, including the purchase of new or like-new locomotives. The Grantee's management has recognized the human resources challenge presented in such expansive growth and has requested assistance from USTDA to fund the cost of goods and services for a management and operations training program that will support the development of critical human capacity resources within the Grantee's railway operations unit, Transnet Freight Rail ("TFR"), and rolling stock manufacturing and maintenance unit, Transnet Rail Engineering ("TRE").</p>
<p>The TR will consist of two separate Grantee delegations: one delegation from TFR and one delegation from TRE. The TFR visit and the TRE visit will not take place concurrently. The TFR and TRE delegations will include a minimum of fifteen delegates each, for a total of at least thirty Grantee delegates. The TFR and TRE delegations will participate in TR-related activities in the United States for a minimum of twenty days each, for a total of at least forty days of TR-related activities. Additional TR requirements are detailed in the Terms of Reference ("TOR") for the TR</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$500,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal and the TOR for the TR, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or the Host Country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the Host Country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee no later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM local (South Africa) time on January 16, 2012</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Solicitation Number:  R11PS30004
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to issue a solicitation for the Design-Build of a new multi-use facility at Hoover Dam.  
Project Description:  Reclamation has a requirement to deconstruct the existing Spillway house building and repurpose at the Central Warehouse; and to reuse the existing foundation for the design and build of a new multi-use facility.  The design and construction shall be to a level to attain a Silver Rating or better, in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The building will be approximately 5,000 gross square feet and shall be of an architectural compatible with the historic district.  The building should complement the Hoover Dam Historic Landmark area and express the spirit and value of Hoover Dam, including the beauty and health of the natural environment.  It should connect people to the outdoors with natural light and views.  The building is located approximately 100 yards north of Hoover Dam, on the Nevada side and is situated on the west bank of Lake Mead.
A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $1M - $5M.
This requirement will be solicited using full and open competition.  There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures, FAR Part 15, and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about April 26, 2011, under Solicitation number R11PS30004.  Only the three highest qualified offerors selected after evaluation of the Phase I proposals will be invited to participate in Phase 2 of the solicitation.  
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about August 11, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of April 2012.   All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.  
NOTE:The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore, the responsibility of all interested parties to periodically access the above FBO internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued and to ensure that they have the most current information.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.

Written questions may be submitted to Rosa M. G?mez at rgomez@usbr.gov or by fax at 702-293-8499.  Only written questions will be accepted and addressed.

<DESC>This Modification was awarded to CGI Federal Inc. the current holder of the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS) contract.&nbsp; The base contract was competitively awarded in January 2007.&nbsp; This requirement/modification was not competed and is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee action.&nbsp; This contract action could not be completed as Firm Fixed Price because it was determined that the nature of the work is unpredictable and therefore, the price/cost could not be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty.&nbsp; The requirement itself was not competed because it was alligned within the scope of the current PECOS contract line item (0007) and modifying the contract would be most cost effective for the Government.<br /><br />The purpose of this action is for The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to modify the PECOS contract to support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requirements to provide program management and technical support for the HITECH project with FMSG.
