<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 111 OF THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATION ACT, 2015 (DIVISION I OF PUB. L. NO. 113-235) AND SIMILAR SECTIONS IN SUBSEQUENT MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACTS, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS OPEN ONLY TO UNITED STATES FIRMS OR TO JOINT VENTURES OF UNITED STATES AND HOST NATION (JAPAN) FIRMS</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION / CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (A-E) Act as implemented by FAR Part 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for multiple Indefinite-Delivery Contracts (IDCs) to support the US DoD construction program in Japan. The acquisition will have a total aggregate capacity of $90 Million (M) shared amongst all awardees. A target of five (5) to ten (10) individual IDCs will be negotiated and awarded. Contracts will be awarded to the most highly qualified firms. The period of performance for each A-E IDC will consist of a one-year base period and four (4) consecutive one-year option periods. Services will be obtained under the multiple A-E IDCs through negotiated firm-fixed price task orders, having a magnitude of $2.5K to $7.5M. TO selections will be determined based on a firm's qualifications for a specific project. Updates to SF330s will be required annually in accordance with FAR 36.603(d). In the event the firm is a JV, the offer must be accompanied by the original copy of the Joint Resolution of the Boards of Directors of the firms composing the JV. To be eligible for contract award, United States firms or United States JV firms that partner with a host nation (Japanese) firm must be registered in the U.S. Government System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM Internet site at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. The Government can issue a Letter of Identification to the employees of the successful firm upon their request after contract award, which entitles individual employees of the A-E firm to enter Japan to perform work on task orders issued under the contract under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and Japan, Article 1(b). This invited status is only granted to individual employees; no status will be granted to the A-E firm as a whole under SOFA Article XIV.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The anticipated work will support US Military Construction (MILCON), MILCON Planning and Design (P&amp;D) efforts, Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, &amp; Modernization (FSRM), Demolition, and related construction for DoD service components and support agencies in Japan. Facilities contemplated under this acquisition include those that normally support the operations and functions of US military installation in Japan, including, but not limited to, tactical equipment maintenance facilities, aircraft maintenance facilities, airfields and runways, administrative and operational facilities, antiterrorism features, family and unaccompanied housing, fuel storage and distribution systems, base wide utility infrastructure, roads, warehouses, DoDEA schools, medical facilities, flight simulation facilities, fueling wharfs, piers, telecommunication facilities, and recreational facilities.

Materials and sites to be investigated may contain Asbestos, Lead Based Paint, CFC, PCB, Radiological Waste, UST, OE, or any other related HTRW/Environmental Material on potentially contaminated sites.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by sub-criterion). Criteria a through e are considered primary. Criteria f is considered secondary and will only be used as a "tie-breaker" among highly qualified firms that are essentially considered technically equal. For purposes of evaluating selection criteria, the use of the term "firm" means the entity/entities listed on the SF330, Part I, Section C (proposed team) identified as a prime, JV partner, or subcontractor. For the purposes of awarding a contract, a firm that is a JV must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) as a JV.</p>
<p>a. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE. The Government will evaluate specialized experience and technical competence based on the information presented in the Architect-Engineer Qualifications - Standard Form 330 (SF330). A maximum of ten (10) example projects may be submitted for consideration under SF330, Part I, Section F. A minimum of one (1) example project must be submitted in order to be evaluated for this primary selection criteria. Example projects should be for design efforts completed within six (6) years of NOP closing. Incomplete projects (less than 100% designed) will not be evaluated. Additional information demonstrating a firm's qualifications may be presented in other sections of the SF330 as appropriate.</p>
<p>(1) Past experience in accomplishing comprehensive design efforts as the Designer of Record (DOR) for Design-Bid-Build or Design-Build projects in support of US Funded Construction Programs in Japan, as described in section 2 of this synopsis. All facility types physically located within and supporting military installations will be considered relevant. Projects of greater scope complexity and requiring participation of multiple disciplines, including subcontractors, will be evaluated more favorably. For example, past experience in designing a 500 MW electric power plant will be evaluated more favorably than past experience in designing a 500 square foot concrete equipment pad. Demonstration of prior working relationships between the prime and subcontractors, with direct involvement of the prime on past projects, will be evaluated more favorably. Example Projects that have been completed by multiple entities within the same firm (e.g., by both members of a joint venture, a subcontractor, and/or a prime contractor), should identify the approximate amount of work (as a percentage of the total value) contributed by each entity of the firm in regards to the total effort. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and supplemental information provided in Section G and H.</p>
<p>(2) Experience and knowledge of Japanese construction criteria, methods, materials, and standards. <br />Demonstrate the ability to incorporate this experience and knowledge to meet the intent of US DoD construction criteria while facilitating and maximizing the use of local materials and construction methods. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to incorporate these elements into the overall design process for projects contemplated under this acquisition action. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and information provided in Section H. <br /><br />(3) Experience in developing construction cost estimates for US DoD projects in Japan. Demonstrate the capability to develop accurate construction cost estimates for US DoD projects in Japan based on the ability to articulate the basis of cost estimates through written narratives that justify cost data sources and rates, assumptions, assumed methodology, indirect costs, and other cost implicating factors. Indicate experience with pricing/estimating in foreign and changing markets, as well as ability to obtain cost data and using this information effectively within MCACES/Mii. Firms may include historical data comparing awarded contract amounts to cost estimates developed during design to demonstrate cost estimating accuracy. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(4) Experience in sustainable design and development (SDD) practices, including experience implementing federal mandates (including but not limited to EPAct 2005, EISA 2007, E.O. 13423, E.O. 13514, and the Federal High Performance and Sustainable Building Guiding Principles), Department of Defense SDD policies and regulations, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) documentation, and LEED certification procedures. Clearly identify the role of the firm, and whether each project has been registered with US Green Building Counsel (USGBC) or certified by Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). Provide a maximum of ten (10) recent (completed within the past 6 years) projects that achieved LEED Silver or higher certification. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and supplemental information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(5) Experience in the total building commissioning process, serving as the Commissioning Authority (CxA) responsible for acquiring all necessary Government systems information, providing technical guidance to develop design, construction, and commissioning documents, and commissioning the various project systems. Additional clarification regarding the CxA process, procedures and responsibilities are presented in USACE Engineering and Construction Bulletin No. 2015-6. Demonstrate CxA oversight work experience on a maximum of five (5) recent (completed with the past 6 years) projects. Project information may be presented under SF330 Section H and is not required to be presented as a separate example project under SF330 Section F. Provide a narrative description of the firm's CxA roles and responsibilities for each project cited. <br /><br />(6) Ability to prepare design drawings in 2D and using Building Information Modeling (BIM) with the latest versions of software from Autodesk and Bentley Systems. Example projects should state if BIM was employed in the preparation of drawings. Firms shall provide a short narrative addressing the firm's adoption of BIM, including when the firm first began using BIM on a regular basis, and what it perceives to be the benefits of BIM. The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F and brief historical information provided in Section H.</p>
<p>(7) Quality Management. Firms will be evaluated on their approach to ensure technical quality and accuracy of work products as prescribed in USACE ER 1110-1-12 Quality Management. A firm's approach to resolve issues of quality will be analyzed to determine their ability to provide quality design products. Describe and define the processes of the firm's quality control plan and list, by name and position, all key personnel responsible for its execution. Quality control information shall address and identify the key relationship between safety and quality, particularly in respect to tasks which require site work and site investigations. Information describing Quality Management may be presented in SF330, Part I, Section H. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will be required prior to contract award from firms who are selected under this NOP.</p>
<p>b. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. Provide a minimum of one (1) individual / up to a maximum of two (2) individuals per discipline for each of the key personnel disciplines identified below, (1) through (19). Firms will not be evaluated more favorably for identifying additional Key Personnel beyond the minimum identified above. Identified key personnel will be more highly evaluated if he or she demonstrates longevity with the firm, and if he or she participated in the firm's sample projects submitted in the SF 330 Section F. Use a separate Section E for each individual. Do not generalize professional registrations or certifications but provide specific details. The lead architect or engineer in each discipline must be registered in the appropriate professional field. For purposes of selection criteria, the use of the term "registered" means a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer registered to practice in the particular discipline in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States. Accepted Japanese equivalent "registered" personnel are listed below. The Government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. This criterion primarily focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the "capacity to accomplish the work" criterion. The Designer of Record in each discipline must be registered in the United States, but does not have to be registered in a particular US state or territory.</p>

<p>c. PAST PERFORMANCE. Firms will be evaluated on past performance for quality of work products, compliance to project schedules, and effectiveness of management. Past performance data for example projects presented under Part I, Section F of the SF330 will be considered. Past performance evaluations will be retrieved through the Government's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and managed through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). PPIRS is the primary source of information on past performance. Performance evaluations will be queried for all firms. Any credible, documented information on past performance may be considered, but the Government is not required to seek other information on past performance if none is available through PPIRS. Complete evaluations will be reviewed if a board is considering downgrading or eliminating a firm due to adverse past performance evaluations. (Note: Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) can be used to provide or supplement a firms past performance with other than U.S. Governmental clients. Firms which choose to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to the below referenced POC via email.). NOTE: if no relevant past performance information is available to evaluate, or if the record is so sparse that no meaningful rating can be reasonably assigned the offeror will be assigned a rating of neutral and shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>d. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK. The Government will consider a firm's experience with similar size projects and its available capacity to perform multiple simultaneous task orders while completing the work within the schedule required by the Government. Demonstrate the firm's capacity to perform up to three (3) task orders concurrently, at separate locations within Japan, not within the same prefecture. Firms will be evaluated on their capability to perform the assigned work based on the number of employees, specified in a list addressing each discipline identified under criterion b; and on the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts that a firm has been awarded. List the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery contracts for each entity of the firm in SF330, Part I, Section H. The basis of this evaluation for this criterion will focus on the information identified in SF330, Part I, Section H and Part II General Qualifications. To receive a rating of Satisfactory for this criteria, the firm must demonstrate availability of the following number of employees, given the full potential value of any current IDCs that the firm currently has been awarded:</p>
<p>Based on total potential value of current IDCs (less than $10M/$10M-$25M/$25M and above)<br />Project Managers - 5/10/15<br />Architects - 5/10/15<br />Landscape Architects - 2/5/7 <br />Interior Designer - 2/5/7 <br />Electrical Engineers/Communication Distribution Designers - 5/10/15 <br />Mechanical Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Civil Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Geotechnical Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Structural Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Fire Protection Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Environmental Engineers - 2/5/7 <br />Surveyors - 2/5/7 <br />CADD Operators - 10/15/20 <br />LEED Accredited Professional (AP) - 1/2/3 <br />Commissioning Authority (CxA) - 1/2/3 <br />Cost Estimators or Cost Engineers - 5/10/15 <br />Certified Value Specialists - 1/2/3 <br />Facilitators - 1/2/3</p>
