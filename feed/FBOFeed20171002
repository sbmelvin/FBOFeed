In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Jeffrey Wyatt, 405-582-       5664, Jeffrey.Wyatt@us.af.mil.

Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Commerciality: Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
23.	Ombudsman: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. The purpose of the ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting office. Interested parties are invited to contact the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  
24.	Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.

The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), BAE Systems, is the only source with the data, parts, expertise, tools and test equipment necessary to repair sufficiently to meet the Government's needs.

The effort is in support of the F15 Weapons System.  The contemplated contract is for repair of multiple F15 Flat Panel Control Indicator (FPCI), Control Display Unit and Circuit Card Assembly from BAE Systems.

LM RMS is the developer, integrator, and test agent for OASIS and AATT simulation software baselines and has sole access to the Aegis Common Source Library (CSL) which contains proprietary information and weapon defense tactical system software. This access is necessary to retrieve the OASIS and AATT software components to analyze and correct reported software performance issues.
 The anticipated award date is 31 March2018.  The anticipated contract value for this procurement is $2.5M total.

LM RMS, as the AATT original equipment manufacturer (OEM), has complete knowledge of the interface design specification between the combat and weapon system elements within the Aegis Ashore Combat System (AACS) tactical software and AATT simulation software. Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports there does not exist a commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governments requirement.  Additionally, the Small Business Office concurred with the decision to sole source to the OEM (LM RMS). 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.
 It is a notice outlining the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with LM RMS.  Interested sources are solicited to provide their written technical capabilities.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

Initial Crabgrass Pre-Emergent Application: Contractor shall apply appropriate herbicide in liquid form when treating for pre emergent crabgrass control at manufactures recommended rate allowable for cool season grasses. Pre-emergent herbicide must be applied with properly calibrated spraying equipment. The contractor shall begin the application after the soil temperature has reached 55 degrees for three consecutive days. This is the time that crabgrass seeds begin active germination in the soil. Any application that is completed before this time may not be as effective in overall crabgrass control. This shall be determined by cemetery staff with the use of a soil thermometer placed at a 1-inch soil depth in various sections of the cemetery to accurately gauge soil temperature. The dates for application listed in the application schedule are only an estimated time frame and could begin earlier or later depending upon the soil temperatures. This application will also include a herbicide that is a post emergent herbicide for the prevention of broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, plantain and clover.    
 
Second (Split) Crabgrass Application: Contractor shall apply herbicide in liquid form when treating for pre emergent crabgrass control at manufactures recommended rate allowable for cool season grasses. Pre-emergent herbicide must be applied with properly calibrated spraying equipment. This application shall occur between 6 weeks after initial crabgrass application and will be meant as a post emergent  control for early tiller stage crabgrass plants and a pre-emergent control for crabgrass.      

Broadleaf Weed Control: Broadleaf herbicides must be applied with properly calibrated spraying equipment (not a hose end sprayer).  The herbicide must control various broadleaf weed species include clover and dandelions. An acceptable broadleaf herbicide to be used can be Trimec, Trimec Encore or its equivalent.  Applications must be timely and at the proper dosage so that perennial weeds do not go to seed. Herbicide shall be applied according to product label specifications to all turf acreage, in burial sections and including areas between and around all headstones and along section perimeters.  Ten (10) days after completion of broadleaf herbicide application, the Contractor and COR will jointly inspect and assess results. In areas where results are less than acceptable*, the Contractor will re-perform the application at no additional cost to the Government (*Acceptable is defined as 90% of actively growing broadleaf weeds are eliminated).

Fertilization: Contractor shall apply a granular turf fertilizer, which is specified in the application schedule to all turf areas using a properly calibrated spreader/sprayer. The fertilizer will have a guaranteed NPK analysis of 26-5-10 and consist of a minimum 50% slow release nitrogen from sulfur coated urea. Fertilizer will be applied to all turf areas at the times and rates that are listed in the turf application schedule. 

Beetle Grub Application: Contractor shall apply a granular herbicide to control beetle grubs that damage turf roots such as Japanese or Oriental beetles. The COR will specify areas needing special attention. The herbicide to be used will be Merit (Imidicloprid) applied at the manufacturers recommended label rate for cool season grasses.      
             

 Post Emergent Broadleaf Weed Control: Broadleaf herbicides must be applied with properly calibrated spraying equipment (not a hose end sprayer).  The herbicide must address issues of various broadleaf weed species to include clover and dandelions. An acceptable broadleaf herbicide to be used can be Trimec, Speedzone, Millennium Ultra, Q4 or its equivalent.  

Post Emergent Crabgrass Control: Contractor will treat turf for control of post emergent crabgrass and yellow / purple nut sedge using an acceptable post emergent crabgrass herbicide and a herbicide that will control nut sedge. Treatments will concentrate on areas that tend to have proliferation of crabgrass growth such as along walkways or roadways and in any turf areas that exhibit high amounts of crabgrass.   

All application methods of fertilizer, herbicides and treatments of annual grasses shall be in strict accordance with manufacturer label recommendations, Department of Environmental Protection and all applicable federal, state and local laws.

All applications must be made in accordance with manufactures label instructions to insure proper rate and timing of application. The contractor will apply liquid broadleaf herbicide no earlier than 6 hours before anticipated rainfall to allow herbicide sufficient time to be absorbed into plant tissue to maximize the herbicide s full potential. Any rainfall that is received within this six-hour time frame after the application will require the contractor to treat all turf areas a second time at the contractor s expense. Seven (7) days prior to any scheduled application, the Contractor shall provide to the COR, a copy of the product label for each chemical used and appropriate supporting Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).

Contractor personnel applying herbicides shall possess a current / valid State of New York commercial pesticide/herbicide application license. The Contractor is responsible for any damage resulting from the application of any herbicide treatments.

All turf applications will be applied with appropriate calibrated spreading and spraying equipment. Liquid and pellet surface applications shall be uniformly distributed within the cemetery s defined area of coverage.  Surface applications shall not be made where surface run-off is likely to occur or near a water source.

(Note: To cause the least possible interference with cemetery activities, contract personnel will stop (cease) all work in areas where burials are taking place. As a general "rule-of-thumb", work should not take place within 1,000 feet of an ongoing committal service or ceremony.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The primary mission of the AN/ALQ-131, -131A and -184 Electronic Attack Pods is to identify and counter increasingly complex, diverse enemy air defense systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pods consist of a multitude of receiver, transmitter and signal processing sub-systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, several support tools and specialized test and measurement equipment ((AN/ALM-256 and AN/ALM-256A ILSE) and AN/ALM-233 Automatic Support Equipment (ASE)) complete the overall system architectures. The AN/ALQ-131(V) and AN/ALQ-184(V) systems were first designed, developed, assembled and deployed in the mid-1970s with incremental hardware and data-flow upgrades since then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the early 1990s the AN/ALQ-131(V) and AN/ALQ-184(V) have been the primary electronic attack defensive systems for the F-16 and A-10 combat aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Numerous obsolescence / systemic deficiencies exist across the AN/ALQ-131 system at the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU)-level owing to the age of the </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">technology as well as the age of the industry which produced it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These deficiencies must be continuously addressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The AN/ALQ-13A program incorporates a permanent modification to the AN/ALQ-131.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The modification integrates a Digital Receiver/Exciter (DRE), which is a digital receiver and advanced techniques generator, and the radio frequency chain from the AN/ALQ-184, into an AN/ALQ-131 pod shell. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Anticipated operational and system deficiencies with new components, as well as AN/ALQ-131 and AN/ALQ-184 components reused or modified in the AN/ALQ-131A, will also have to be resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To keep pace with the evolution of the electronic battlefield arena, and to correct software operational and system deficiencies, routine, mission critical, and emergency software maintenance support is required for the AN/ALQ-131A Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Additionally, AN/ALQ-184 OFP documented deficiencies require review to determine validity and suitability and correction in the currently fielded software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These corrections to the OFP require IV&amp;V prior to final release of software.</span></p>

<DESC>Title of Project: Geospatial Research, Analysis and Services Program (GRASP)<br />Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences ATSDR
<p>Introduction: "This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. <br />The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541370, Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services, with a size standard of $15M.<br />Background. Over the past 25 years, the public health community has come to recognize the importance of geospatial science, technology and visualization as applied to public health research and practice. GIS (geographic information system) science, technology and visualization have become essential in the examination of trends and patterns associated with infectious &amp; chronic disease, environmental exposure, and injury. More than just a mapping tool, GIS has become invaluable in understanding the context of emerging diseases, environmental exposures, and access to healthcare. GIS has become a transformative element in the public health toolbox.</p>
<p>GRASP, the Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences (DTHHS), ATSDR) is a program that provides ongoing GIS (geographic information system) science and technology support to Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR), and multiple other CIOs across CDC/ATSDR. The mission of GRASP is to provide leadership and expertise in the application of the concepts, methods, and tools of geography and geospatial information science to public health research and practice across CDC/ATSDR and among the public health community. GRASP objectives are to (1) research and analyze the geospatial trends and patterns relevant to diverse factors associated with environmental health, infectious and chronic disease, and emergency preparedness &amp; response, (2) geospatially enable CDC/ATSDR scientists and systems with data, consulting, technology, and training, (3) collaborate with scientists and researchers at the CDC/ATSDR and among our public health partners to address diverse public health issues, (4) contribute to a vibrant geospatial community among public health professionals, and (5) embrace, leverage and promote technology.</p>
<p>GRASP has grown and diversified to include 50+ staff (FTE/CONTRACT) with expertise in geography, GIS analysis, cartography, geospatial statistics, computer science, remote sensing, epidemiology, emergency preparedness &amp; response, and demography. GRASP is highly collaborative and promotes the integration of geography and geospatial science into public health, focuses on training and education, and emphasizes the importance of effective use of GIS technology to work with CDC/ATSDR and beyond to prevent disease, prolong life, and promote health. GRASP scientists work extensively with partners across the CDC/ATSDR and among the broader public health community. For example, GRASP worked with NCEH/Health Community Design Initiative to develop refined measures for the built-environment that were subsequently shared on the Environmental Public Health Tracking Portal (Dec 2012).</p>
<p>GRASP collaborated with the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) to better understand time and distance barriers to access cancer screening and treatment (2009 - Present). Additionally, GRASP has worked with the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) to design and build the NCHHSTP Atlas, the first web-based visualization tool ever released by the CDC to visualize state and county NCHHSTP surveillance data (released Jan 2011), and has worked with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)/Influenza Division to enhance mapping that is integrated into routine influenza surveillance (2009 - Present). GRASP worked with Healthy People 2020 to develop a baseline metric for the Healthy People 2020 school siting measure (Dec 2010), and has integrated and supported mapping directly into CDC WONDER (2003- Present). In addition, since 2003, GRASP has provided all GIS technology and analytic support to the CDC Emergency Operations Center ("EOC"), which enables the CDC to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies and events of all kinds.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of the GRASP Geospatial Science, Technology, and Visualization IDIQ contract is to provide contractor support to complete geospatial science, technology, and visualization tasks that range from limited consultations to large, multi-year efforts requiring several contractors to complete. For example, a GIS technology task supported by this IDIQ contract may be require a full contract team for a period of 1 year to design, develop, test, and release an interactive atlas requiring extensive expertise in systems integration, design, application development, database programming, and coordination. Another example task supported by this contractor may require a single contractor for a period of 6 months to design and automate a set of GIS map templates which will be used by GRASP staff in a repeated manner. Another example task supported by this contract may require a single contractor for a period of 1 year to analyze GIS health care access data and draft a manuscript outlining analysis conclusions and recommendations for further study.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work. The scope of the GRASP Geospatial Science, Technology, and Visualization IDIQ Contract includes the provision of contract support spanning multiple expertise areas required for GRASP to plan, deliver, support, and evaluate GIS projects for partners across the CDC/ATSDR and in the broader public health community.</p>
<p>Experience and Expertise Required<br />To perform the tasks GRASP envisions being associated with this IDIQ contract, the contractor must have expertise in GIS, geography, geospatial information science, cartography, data visualization, geospatial statistics, epidemiology, public health policy, computer science, systems integration, web/desktop application development, database design/development, UI/UX (user-interface/user-experience design), systems analysis, business process management, project management, data management, verbal/written technical communication. <br />Broad Communication and Collaboration Requirements<br />Contractors within GRASP are required to (1) interface with the diverse and multi-disciplinary GRASP staff to obtain clarity in requirements (if needed), and (2) communicate complex GIS science and technology concepts to GRASP staff and CDC/ATSDR staff who collaborate with GRASP on various projects. Thus, all GRASP contractors are required to have excellent oral and written communication skills.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The General Services Administration (GSA) is considering utilization of Job Order Contracting (JOC) as a government-wide contracting method to procure minor construction repair and renovation services. GSA envisions awarding long term, geographically based, JOC contracts to qualified companies so that Federal Agencies can then leverage for project delivery via establishment of long term ordering agreements or short term (single project) task orders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The type of JOC we envision is a competitively bid, fixed unit price and rate multiple-year, multiple award construction contract, wherein qualified companies agree to provide a broad range of possible routine, non-complex repair/renovation projects based on pre-established unit prices and rates.&nbsp; Contract line items and unit prices would be defined by a construction unit price book (UPB) or similar extensive list (reference list) and a multiplier or coefficient applied to the reference unit prices. The reference lists/UPBs are often referred to as construction catalogs or automated cost databases, and most established UPBs have a city cost index to localize pricing. The multiplier or coefficient reflects overhead, profit, general and administrative costs, uncertainty in costs, etc.&nbsp; The resulting contract unit prices <em>(i.e., reference list item prices x coefficient)</em> are then used to price construction task orders that are within the scope of the JOC contract.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">In order to assess the relevance and extent of this JOC approach within the commercial (non-government) marketplace, as well as industry perspectives on the approach the Government requests industry feedback. &nbsp;Specifically, GSA is interested in responses to the following topics:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: .75in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">1.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to this Request for Information was your Company familiar with Job Order Contracting (JOC)?</p>

The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center is seeking information about the capabilities of potential third party companies to furnish the following:

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a contract for the purchase of TheraSphere Y90

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  

1. TheraSphere  3 GBq, 5 GBq, 7 GBq, 10 GBq, 15 GBq and 20 GBq at Calibration date and time (also available by special order in half or full GBq dose sizes within the 3GBq   20 GBq range)

TheraSphere Y glass microspheres are specifically engineered to carry far greater power than any other Y liver-directed cancer therapy, delivering high doses of radiation to liver tumors while sparing normal tissue.  The result is a powerfully-targeted, well-tolerated therapy that may lead to patients becoming eligible for curative therapies.  TheraSphere is used in transarterial radioembolization (TARE), also known as selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), a procedure in which glass microspheres containing radioactive Y are delivered to the tumor vasculature via transfemoral catheterization of the hepatic artery.  TheraSphere capitalizes on the uniquely organized dual blood supply to the liver, which occurs through the hepatic artery and the portal vein.  In liver cancer, tumor blood supply is almost exclusively (80 100%) from the hepatic artery.   In contrast, normal liver tissue receives most of its blood flow (75%) from the portal vein.  TheraSphere glass microspheres are minimally embolic and do not occlude macrovessels. Since vessel patency is maintained, subsequent arterial therapies are possible.  TheraSphere microspheres penetrate and lodge within the tumor arteriolar capillaries, where they emit lethal beta radiation that is localized to the surrounding tumor tissue.  The targeted distribution of microspheres optimizes dose exposure to the tumor while sparing normal tissue.



The MEDVAMC is defined as the main location at 2002 Holcombe Blvd, Houston Texas, 77030, and all current and future community based outpatient clinics in the Houston Area. The current CBOC Clinics are located in Texas City, Galveston, Richmond, Lufkin, Beaumont, Katy, Tomball Conroe and Lake Jackson all in the state of Texas.

Include past experience in performing these services to the VA, other Government (Federal or State) agency, or for a private facility. Please specify your availability to start date and your address. (2) BUSINESS SIZE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS: (a) Indicate whether your business is large or small (b) If small, indicate if your firm qualifies as a small, emerging business, or small disadvantaged business (c) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (d) Indicate if your firm is a certified Hub-zone firm (e) Indicate if your firm is a woman-owned or operated business (f) Indicate if your firm is a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) (g) Include the DUNS number of your firm.

<RESPDATE>102017
<CONTACT>Heather Bauer, Phone 3019752752, Email heather.bauer@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a liquid handling laboratory instrument for conducting research and experiments.
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background and Purpose:</p>
<p>The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) needs to acquire a liquid handling laboratory instrument to conduct research and experiments. Installation and training are also required. The instrument will be used to transfer small volumes of liquid (2.5 nL) from multi-well source plates (96-, 384-, or 1536-well) to multi-well destination plates or to solid agar surfaces.</p>
<p>For well-to-well transfers, the instrument must be able to array liquid from any well in the source plate to any well in the destination plate; small volumes are crucial. The major use for this format is to re-array barcoded yeast libraries quickly and without using plastic consumables (pipette tips). Another use is to generate small volume reagent mixes for PCR or next-generation sequencing (reducing liquid consumable costs).</p>
<p>For well-to-agar transfers, the instrument must be able to array liquid from any well in the source plate to a defined location on the agar plate with enough accuracy to create an array of droplets at a pitch of 500nm (500nm between the center of each droplet). This feature will be used to mate barcoded yeast in dense arrays for recombinase directed indexing (see Molecular systems biology 13 (2), 913).</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they may be capable of meeting NIST's requirement detailed below should respond to this notice with a narrative demonstrating their ability to meet NIST's requirement. Contractors may provide supplemental information at their discretion.</p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<p>1. The instrument shall not require tips, nozzles, or pin tools to transfer liquids. This eliminates the possibility of samples adhering to the tips, tip carryover, or tip leachates entering the sample.</p>
<p>2. The instrument shall transfer samples from a source plate to a destination plate. The instrument can transfer reagents in the following ways:<br />a. One well to one well for plate replication in 96, 384 and 1536 well patterns.<br />b. One well to many wells to distribute solutions to destination plates containing 1-<br />1536 wells or target locations. <br />c. Any well to any well which enables cherry picking, hit picking, and reformatting of solutions to destination plates containing 1-1536 wells or target locations.</p>
<p>3. The instrument can transfer 2.5 nL - 10 &mu;L of fluid into each well.</p>
<p>4. The instrument can transfer 2.5 nL volume increments with a drop transfer volume accuracy &lt;10% and a CV &lt;8%.</p>
<p>5. The instrument has a hydration accuracy of &lt;8% deviation from target and hydration precision of &lt;5% CV.</p>
<p>6. The instrument performs analysis to determine the height and fluid composition of the fluid in each well. This analysis calculates the power required to successfully transfer the fluid from each well during the fluid transfer operation.</p>
<p>7. The instrument measures hydration of DMSO and reports the hydration level as a DMSO percentage in each well of the microplate. This enables the end user to monitor the quality of the compound library.</p>
<p>8. The instrument reports the fluid height, detected volume, and the list of any wells that the system was unable to transfer during the transfer operation.</p>
<p>9. The instrument performs rapid transfer of compounds, samples, and reagents used in drug discovery, high content imaging studies, ADMET, gene expression, genotyping, synthetic biology, biochemical assays, cell based assays, sequencing applications, and protein crystallography screens. Example of fluids that the instrument transfers include 70-100% DMSO, salts, proteins, small molecules, compounds, nucleic acids, simple buffers, viscous fluids, 0-50% glycerol, genomics reagents, biochemical reagents, oligonucleotides, and surfactants.</p>
<p>10. The instrument can transfer solutions to locations on a surface with or without material present including slides, agar surfaces, microfluidics devices, dry destination wells, or wells that already contain fluids/samples.</p>
<p>11. The instrument performs rapid cherry picking for uses in applications such as pooling of samples, libraries, and barcodes for next-generation sequencing preparations and hit picking in drug discovery.</p>
<p>12. The instrument can transfer multiple fluid types and volumes from one plate into another plate enabling rapid assay creation from one source plate.</p>
<p>13. The instrument performs direct dilutions which enables the elimination of steps when creating standard curves required in some assays including dose response curves, gene expression assays, and biochemical reactions.</p>
<p>14. The instrument can transfer can array onto MALDI chips and glass slides.</p>
<p>15. The instrument allows the installation of a barcode reader inside the instrument to scan microplate barcodes.</p>
<p>16. The instrument integrates with a laboratory workstation. Configurations can include plate handling devices, microplate storage racks, plate handling robots, accessory hotels, and modular workstation tables.</p>
<p>17. The instrument integrates with 3rd party robotics platforms through its application software.</p>
<p>18. Instrument software contains applications that allow for plate replication, plate reformatting, custom assay creation, creation of multipoint curves with controls or references and replicate curves, transfer of fluids from any well to any well, anchor screening, synergistic screening, grid screening, ability to compare characteristics of samples within or across plates, ability to graphically design custom patterns for bottom of microplate wells, slides, or agar plates.</p>

<RESPDATE>101717
<CONTACT>Kelly L.  Rubio , Contracting Officer , Phone 2812447890, Email kelly.l.rubio@nasa.gov
<DESC><p>NASA/JSC has a requirement to sustain and utilize the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), which is on-board the International Space Station (ISS), to stow ISS equipment and in addition to its use as a test-bed for new technology demonstrations, during and beyond the BEAM initial baseline period of performance. <br /><br />NASA Headquarters issued contract NNH12309355 to Bigelow Aerospace for the BEAM technology demonstration on December 20, 2012. The BEAM, an expandable soft-goods module, was flown onboard the SpaceX Dragon vehicle and delivered to the ISS in April 2016, where it was installed on Node 3 Aft by the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), expanded, and checked out. The baseline technology demonstration period, which began June 2016, is two years.</p>
<p>BEAM continues to demonstrate positive performance in space and initial studies have shown that it can be used long-term on the ISS to support the government's needs for on-orbit stowage and for technology demonstrations. Current estimates are that BEAM will provide the government a minimum of 109 Cargo Transfer Bags (CTBs) of on-orbit stowage with a goal of 130 CTBs, during its anticipated life. Long-term use of BEAM ISS is expected to provide NASA valuable performance data in such areas as structures, radiation, Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD), and microbial growth. The use of the BEAM as part of a human-rated system by NASA will allow Bigelow Aerospace to demonstrate its technology for future commercial applications in Low Earth Orbit. <br /><br />NASA/JSC intends to issue a sole source contract to Bigelow Aerospace starting in the first quarter Fiscal Year 2018 to provide sustaining engineering, anomaly resolution, and engineering analysis, in addition to BEAM stowage and life-extension certification. This new contract, with a base contract period of three years, with two one-year options, will overlap the baseline contract technology demonstration period. <br /><br />The BEAM was uniquely designed and manufactured by Bigelow Aerospace and they currently retain ownership of the BEAM module as well as all proprietary drawings, models and detailed manufacturing data.

<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to commercialize its large area (greater than 100 cm2), ultrathin (less than 10 nm thick), ultra strong, free-standing polymer films technology.<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">: </span></strong></span></p>
<p>Ultra-thin polymer films are defined as films with thicknesses below 100 nm. The thinnest freestanding films found in open literature are 20 nm thick and typically have diameters of less than 100 um.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such films are typically made by spin coating or dip coating a dilute solution of the polymer onto a substrate. Release the film from the substrate presents a problem. Typically a release or sacrificial layer such as sputtered salt or soap is dissolved to remove the film is removed from the substrate. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The films are released by immersion in water. The film will float on the water surface and can be transferred to a holder, commonly a grid with small (typically sub-micron to 100 um) openings that define the free-standing area of film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Most disadvantages of the current method are connected to the substrate. The substrate preparation can introduce roughness on the order of several nanometers, especially in the case of sputtered liftoff layers and the nonuniformity becomes more severe as the film thickness is reduced. Sacrificial liftoff layers can contaminate the film and decrease the strength of the film. At thicknesses lower than 30 nm, just the release of the film from the substrate becomes difficult to impossible. In addition, the shape of the holder, the liftoff technique itself, and the properties of the polymer that is used to produce the thin film limit the size of the film. Large films will often tear when lifted out of the water, and in some cases they tear while drying.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Biomedical membranes today are manufactured through such processes as microlithography, ion beam etching, electrochemical leaching (anodization) and sol-gel processes. PEEL offers a potentially simpler, faster way to produce biomedically useful membranes.</p>
<p>PEEL was originally developed to produce ultrathin films for the assembly of inertial confinement fusion targets. These targets have a fuel capsule that must be supported with minimal mass to avoid perturbations to the implosion.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br /><strong>Description</strong></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><strong>:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong>&nbsp; <br /></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />LLNL Polyelectrolyte Enabled Liftoff (PEEL), is used to fabricate freestanding polymer films as thin as 10 nm that are capable of bearing loads ranging from milligrams to grams and deformations of up to forty percent (40%). PEEL employs robust, water-based, and self-optimizing surface chemistry to fabricate ultrathin films greater than 100 cm2 in area. The process is easily scalable in size and manufacturing quantity and applicable to a variety of polymeric materials.<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />The key to PEEL's usefulness to industrial processes is its flexibility. It <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>is scalable up to roll-to-roll level for high manufacturing volumes. It can use any kind of chemistry to generate membranes. Another significant benefit is that the film removal is water-based-it doesn't need hazardous organic solvents. This makes PEEL a far more environmentally benign, safer process. PEEL allows its user to self-optimize the manufacturing process at any scale from surface micromachining to roll level.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">PEEL's scalability, low cost, and environmentally benign chemistry offer benefits to a wide range of membrane manufacturing processes in use today. It could help manufacturers overcome a cost and production barriers limiting the broader adoption of advanced membrane technologies that are thought too costly or too difficult to manufacture.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Title: W9126G-17-R-0135, DLA General Purpose Warehouse at Red River Army Depot, Texarkana Texas</p>
<p>Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at</p>
<p>U.S. Army Engineer District, Fort Worth<br />ATTN: CESWF-CT (Paige Stone) paige.e.stone@usace.army.mil <br />Post Office Box 17300 or 819 Taylor Street (2a17) (if using express mail)<br />Fort Worth, TX 76102-0300</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million). This market survey is being posted for Project: DLA General Purpose Warehouse at Red River Army Depot, at Texarkana, Texas. This will be a solicitation for a Construction contract for a single C- Type awarded contract for Fiscal Year 18.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Government plans to construct a General Purpose Warehouse approximately 240,000 square feet storage capacity and 3,000 square feet of Administrative space at Red River Army Depot, located in Texarkana, Texas.</p>
<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>The warehouse is needed to store and handle various equipment and materials up to a moderate hazard level. GPW facilities provide storage capabilities, warehouse operations space and administration space used to support logistics and base operations. Functional spaces generally include bulk storage area, shipping, receiving, administrative offices, and a customer service area. The facilities support outside storage for bulk material as deemed necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Project Labor Agreement:</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<br />Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause<br />52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the<br />Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement?<br />What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the<br />Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Paige Stone, at paige.e.stone@usace.army.mil and courtesy copy (cc) the Contracting Officer, Mr. John H. Rodgers, at john.h.rodgers@usace.army.mil no later than 3:00 p.m., 17 October 2017.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in the following relative order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Technical<br />2. Price<br />3. Past Performance</p>

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are:<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> Teledyne cage 98571 for part 843591-3.</span></p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator means a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity to establish additional System for Award Management (SAM) records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator (if applicable), the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>Unique entity identifier means a number or other identifier used to identify a specific commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity. See www.sam.gov for the designated entity for establishing unique entity identifiers.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the unique entity identifier is maintained with the entity designated at www.sam.gov for establishment of the unique entity identifier throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.   Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns.  

The Contract Officer 

(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tiered order:

  (a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB);
  (b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB);
  (c) all other small business concerns;
  (d) other than small business.

(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of 
      offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can 
      be made.

This is a request for quotations (RFQ). The quote document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94, 2005-95 / 01-19-2017.


The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611430, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. 
.

Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. NREL develops renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices, advances related science and engineering, and transfers knowledge and innovations to address the nation's energy and environment goals.
<p>The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, on behalf of NREL, located in Golden, Colorado intends to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the next-generation high performance computing (HPC) system to be installed at NREL's Energy System Integration Facility (ESIF). The primary objective of the ESIF-HPC-2 procurement is to provide a computational system that will support the technical and scientific computing needs of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <br />NREL aims to procure a highly productive, robust system that will handle a diverse workload and has the ability to handle new workloads associated with energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development. To meet these needs, NREL intends to procure a computational resource that comprises two different types of compute nodes plus data analysis and visualization nodes, data transfer nodes as well as a storage system that provides shared file systems, all connected with a single high-performance interconnect fabric. <br /><strong><br />RFP Solicitation and Selection:</strong></p>
<p>This solicitation has been released publicly, encouraging fair and open competition. This solicitation has not been set aside for small business concerns, however NREL encourages participation from businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>NREL is interested in considering offers for the HPC system, the Data Storage System (DSS) and offers for both the HPC and Data Storage systems, or &lsquo;Full System'. The selection of proposal(s) for award(s) shall be conducted using Best Value Selection that results in award(s) deemed most advantageous to NREL based on the best value combination of (a) evaluated qualitative merit and (b) evaluated price of the offers submitted.</p>
<p>Best Value Selection is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offerors with the lowest evaluated price (cost). However, NREL will consider awarding to an Offeror with a higher evaluated price (cost) if the offer demonstrates the difference in price (cost) is commensurate with the higher qualitative merit. Conversely, NREL will consider awarding to Offerors with a lower evaluated qualitative merit if the price (cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished.

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant.

If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

Please see attachements for details<br /><br /><strong>Pre-Solicitation Notice - M205 Tripod</strong><br /><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE of a proposed requirement regarding the M205 Lightweight Tripod (NSN: 1005-01-586-5702) for Heavy Machine Guns. The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey-Soldier Weapons (ACC-NJ-SW) on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW) intends to award a Single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders. The contract will include five (5) ordering periods to cover FY18 - FY22 Army and Department of Defense (DoD) M205 requirements. This requirement is 100% set aside for small business. The anticipated contract minimum is $630,000.00. The anticipated contract maximum is 19,024 M205 tripods. This notice of intent is NOT a request for draft or formal competitive proposals.<br /><br />The M205 Tripod is used with the M2/M2A1 Heavy Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun and will be produced to a Government Technical Data Package (TDP). The M205 is an improved ground mount which will replace the heavier and larger M3 Tripod for ground mounting the M2/M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine Gun and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG). An integral Traverse and Elevation (T&amp;E) Mechanism is included as part of the M205 and provides controlled manipulation in both T&amp;E. The M205's primary mission is to provide a stable, easy to-use, mounting platform for the M2/M2A1 and MK19 for delivering controlled, sustained, and accurate fire at extended ranges to support combat operations in offensive and defensive roles.<br /><br />Any offeror awarded a contract resulting from the solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT). A crucial aspect of FAT is a Live Fire Test requirement to be performed by the successful offeror(s). The Live Fire Test requirement(s) will be solely performed by the contractor. The awardee will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished machineguns,<br />ammunition, and equipment in order to be considered for award. The Firing Test requirement(s) will be outlined and included with the solicitation. The FAT and Lot Acceptance Test requirements will be outlined and included in the solicitation. Should a resulting contract be awarded, the First Article Sample would be submitted to the<br />Government 180 days after contract award, and monthly production deliveries would commence within 60 days after Government approval of the First Article Sample. Production deliveries would ramp up from 50 per month to 400 per month by the sixth (6) delivery. Delivery schedules for future orders will be establish at time of award.<br /><br />The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M205 Tripod is categorized as Distribution D and is restricted accordingly. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.<br />Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level. The manufacture of the M205 Tripod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of<br />the TDP. (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/for instructions and information). At time of the Request for Proposal (RFP), TDP requests shall be submitted in writting using AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire along with a signed DD 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement form, a fully executed Non Disclosure<br />and Non Use Agreement and a fully executed Shipping Request Form. All required documents will be provided at solicitation release. In order to provide the data to foreign subcontractors, offerors must apply for an export license. An offeror's delay in applying for a DD 2345 certification or an export license will not be a basis to extend<br />the closing date of any future request for proposal. Only contractors who have completed and signed the required documents as prescribed in the solicitation will be granted access to the technical data. Drawings will not be provided as part of this PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. At the conclusion of the solicitation process, all respondents in receipt of data will be required to complete a Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed.<br /><br />This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Solicitation is planned to be issued within the 4th quarter of FY 17.

<DESC><strong>MCC is no longer accpeting EOIs for this RFI<br /></strong><br />Request for Information (RFI) #MCC-17-RFI-0081 and Expressions of Interest (EOI)
<p>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT BEHAVIOR CHANGE RELATED TO ENERGY CONSUMPTION PRACTICES, ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AND OPEN DATA AS PART OF THE KOSOVO THRESHOLD PROGRAM</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION <br />The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is working with the Government of Kosovo (GOK) on the development of a Threshold Program. MCC requires consultancy services to support the due diligence of projects and activities that will effectively address behavior change components of the reliable energy and transparent and accountable governance constraints to economic growth in Kosovo. Technical advisory support to MCC will be required for a period of 5 years. Once the threshold program enters into force - expected during 2017 - the GOK entity accountable for Threshold implementation will use MCC Threshold funds to select implementing partners. Implementing partners can be government ministries, individual consultants and consulting firms. Note: Offerors on this present MCC procurement, when issued, are advised that the firm awarded a contract by MCC for these due diligence services will not be eligible to bid for services for the same or related activities on subsequent procurements by the eventual GOK entity responsible for actual implementation of Threshold program using MCC funds.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION and PURPOSE<br />The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) and Requesting Information (RFI), comments, questions and suggestions on a Draft Statement of Work for technical services for the behavior change related to energy consumption practices, environmental data and open data as part of the Kosovo Threshold Program.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to: <br />1) offer the opportunity for interested organizations to provide information, opinions, recommendations on innovative approaches for implementation, and ask questions for the draft Statement of Work before it is finalized;<br />2) conduct market research, to determine interest in the services as currently envisioned or as may be modified given the responses to this RFI; <br />3) to receive responses to the specific questions set out below; <br />4) provide an anticipated time table for the solicitation; and<br />5) provide the industry a platform to collaborate and participate in the upcoming solicitation.<br /><br />After incorporation of the industry's comments and suggestions, the MCC anticipates releasing a Request for Quotation (RFQ). Note that this is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This RFI asks only for comments and questions related to the attached draft SOW, which is planned for subsequent release of a Request for Quotations (RFQ) anticipated to be issued in July of 2017.</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This RFI does not commit MCC to issue a solicitation, contract for any supply or service. Responders are advised that MCC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.</p>
<p>All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFQ. It is the potential offerors' responsibility to monitor www.fbo.gov for the release of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GENERAL PROJECT OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of this requirement is to provide expert skills to MCC for the due diligence technical services for the Kosovo Threshold Program.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall serve as a technical advisor to MCC providing due diligence and design improvement recommendations on the GOK's environmental data, open data challenge and behavior change related to reliable energy proposals; the Contractor is not a technical advisor to the GOK.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC PROJECT OBJECTIVES<br />The specific objective of this requirement is to provide support to MCC for due diligence activity design and implementation of:</p>
<p>(1) Behavior Change related to Reliable Supply of Electricity - this activity will pilot various types of economic incentives and modalities for households to invest in cost-effective, energy saving measures, including subsidizing investment in energy efficiency products (e.g. insulation, windows, sealing building envelope), as well as testing consumption-based metering of district heating systems. The behavior change component of this activity will include an assessment of barriers to change habits, willingness to pay for household investments, effective methods of behavior change communication in Kosovo, and the design and implementation of a behavior change strategy, including what types of data or information may be most motivating. <br />(2) The Environmental Data Activity - this activity will provide support to GoK institutions involved in environmental protection and health promotion to effectively monitor and report on select environmental indicators to a variety of stakeholders, including the public. The activity would also strengthen the ability of civil society to interpret the data in order to engage more productively with the GoK on environmental and health issues. <br />(3) The Open Data Challenge Activity - this activity will foster productive partnerships between government and civil society (including private sector), and support innovation in data use and analysis, and a culture of information sharing and evidence-based decision-making by awarding grants through a competitive process to individuals or organizations who have creative ideas about how to use, analyze, and present data to support government's analytical and public communication needs.</p>
<p>The Draft Statement of Work is attached below. All comments, suggestions and questions from the industry are welcome.</p>
<p>Expression of Interest to bid are requested (see the info below).</p>
<p>QUESTIONS<br />In addition, MCC is seeking industry responses on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What advantages, if any, would there be to procuring the services required for the Open Data Challenge Activity separately from services required for the Environmental Data Activity? <br />2. What skills should be required for the Environmental Data Team as a whole? <br />3. What skills should be required for the Open Data Challenge Team as a whole?<br />4. What skills should be required for the Reliable Supply of Energy Behavior Change activity? <br />5. What methodology(ies) should be required or tested for the Behavior Change activity (e.g. approaches to assess barriers to change related to promoting and realizing cost-effective, energy saving measures, including metering of district heating systems, or types of information presented)?<br />6. Please review the titles/roles and qualification requirements for the illustrative list of base period personnel for each of the three activities and suggest any changes or additions that would produce a stronger team.<br />7. What is a reasonable amount of man-hours for each key personnel associated with each of the three activities, considering the deliverables listed? <br />8. How would you envision integrating the Behavior Change activity with the more technical (engineering, environmental, and financial) analyses of options to be offered to consumers for energy efficiency and metering for district heating?</p>
<p>RESPONSES<br />Responses to the RFI, comments, questions and suggestions on the Draft SOW and MCC's questions listed below should be forwarded to Nataliya Holl, Senior Contract Specialist, at hollna@mcc.gov and Andrew Lee, Contract Specialist, at leeae@mcc.gov by June 27, 2017 at 2:00 pm EST with "RFI MCC-17-RFI-0081 RFI for Kosovo" as the email subject line. Expressions of Interest from the companies are welcome until MCC provides a specific deadline later in the RFQ.</p>
<p>All proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please clearly identify proprietary information as "proprietary," if any, in your responses. The Proprietary Information obtained through this RFI will be held in confidence and will not be disclosed to the public, unless specifically requested by responding sources. All other responses will be used to inform MCC's SOW design and may be incorporated into any future solicitation. Please note that responders will not receive individualized feedback.</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO THE RFI<br />Responses to the RFI are limited to 12 (twelve) pages and shall include, at a minimum, the following: <br />1) The name and address of the company; <br />2) Primary point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address of the company; and <br />3) Size and type of ownership of the organization.</p>
<p>Please attach any documents that support your comments to the questions above. Attachments should not exceed 10 pages in total.</p>
<p>EXPRESSION OF INTERESTS<br />MCC is seeking to open this RFI and the future solicitation, in a manner consistent, where feasible, with Open Contracting Principles (http://www.open-contracting.org). More information will be provided at the RFQ, when it will be published at www.FBO@gov .</p>

All prime and subcontractors are encouraged to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to MCC, which will be published on FBO for the companies to form partnerships and submit a better informed proposal. The window for submitting EOIs will be open until the future solicitation will be closed, sometime in July-August 2017; MCC will provide a specific deadline later.</p>
<p>In addition, MCC will make publically available a list of all organizations, contact names and information that submitted an EOI to enable collaboration and provide information for prime applicants seeking to partner with sub-partners. Please note that it is NOT mandatory for respondents to this RFI to submit an EOI.</p>
<p>EOI INFORMATION CONTENT <br />1. Organization name <br />2. Contact person name and title <br />3. Contact phone and e-mail address <br />4. Short (max 2 pages) description of particular area of expertise and potential value added to the services or in partnership with others to deliver the services.</p>

<DESC><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) focuses on research to discover genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and identifying new approaches to cancer prevention.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCEG plans to build a new prospective multi-center adult cohort study of 150,000-200,000 adult participants enrolled through U.S. Integrated Health Care Systems (IHCS) to study the causes of cancer and the means of its prevention. The goal of this acquisition is to work with selected IHCS sites to recruit health plan members from selected IHCS sites into this complex, intensive, prospective cohort study, to collect serial biospecimens and longitudinal data, and to follow participants for disease outcomes, with a primary focus on cancer.</p>
<p>The IHCS sites will work with NCI, other NCI third party contractors (support service and study information technology [IT] platform  contractors), processing labs, central repository, various oversight committees, and researchers to recruit health plan members, collect serial biospecimens and longitudinal data, and to follow participants for disease outcomes.</p>
<p>The project will require multiple contractors to perform the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide site-specific estimates as necessary for study planning and implementation purposes e.g. median duration of membership within health plan, estimated number of eligible participants by demographic characteristics, estimated number of projected incident cancer cases, participation rates of screening, number of known and potential cancer precursors by demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate and integrate all of the Task Order activities including staffing decisions, prioritizing support for projects, preparing required reports, deliverables and other official documentation, and managing subcontracts. The Contractor shall ensure quality assessment and quality control of the work performed, fostering internal/external communications, tracking projects, and monitoring the budget.</p>
<p>&bull;	Work cooperatively with the NCI, support services contractor, study IT platform contractor, and other IHCS sites in all relevant aspects of study development and execution to maximize cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the study. Obtain and maintain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval(s) as necessary.</p>
<p>&bull;	Use the cohort IT study infrastructure to enter all data related to the study and to manage and coordinate all study activities at the IHCS site.</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop/customize and maintain the necessary infrastructure to identify and recruit eligible individuals (e.g. develop algorithms, data programs, databases), collect, process and track biospecimens, and follow-up participants (e.g. email).</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as the point of contact to health plan members and participants to answer questions for all stages of the study (e.g. host a toll-free telephone line) and contribute information (e.g. for a newsletter or study updates) to be included in study website. Study related questions and issues raised by members and participants should be collated and shared with NCI and third party contractors.  This information will be reported to NCI as described in the reporting requirements of  the Solicitation. While consent will be obtained electronically and questionnaires will be completed online and both activities will be managed by the NCI and third party contractors, the IHCS site will serve as the point of contact for individuals and participants who would like additional information or have questions related to the study. If a participant leaves the health plan their primary point of contact will be the support services contractor, managed under a separate contract. Responsibility for follow-up activities will also transfer to the support services contractor.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide services as necessary to enable electronic submission of standardized data from various data sources such as the EMR to the study IT platform, and expert review of clinical events by IHCS sites. Perform regular routine updates of data as well as for &lsquo;new' data abstraction. All electronic submissions should be fully annotated and deposited in a central repository for future reference.</p>
<p>&bull;	Collect, process, and transfer biological specimens and data from participants according to SOPs provided by NCI.</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform administrative, operational, and technical duties to support productive collaboration among the study personnel at all sites, NCI, support services contractor and platform solution contractor.</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate collaboratively in study committees.</p>
<p>&bull;	Host one site visit per year or as otherwise required by each Task Order at each IHCS site, attend an annual meeting for all stakeholders, and participate in regular meetings with NCI and third party contractors and consultants as required.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide data verification for collaborative publications with the IHCS site investigators, NCI, support services contractor, and platform solution.</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure data security and confidentiality requirements are met.</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and submit technical and financial reports.</p>
<p>&bull;	Adapt and integrate any modifications to study protocol as needed.</p>
<p>&bull;	Work cooperatively with the NCI, support services contractor, study IT platform contractor, and other IHCS sites in all relevant aspects of study development and execution to maximize cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the study. NCI will prioritize the order of tasks and activities.</p>
<p>Specific Task areas include:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.	Task Area 1:</span></strong> Study Planning and Preparation. Task Area 1 shall encompass all activities necessary for preparing for participant recruitment, follow-up, and biological specimen and data collections.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.	Task Area 2:</strong></span> Pilot Studies. Task Area 2 will include performing a run-in pilot phase for recruitment and data and specimen collection to identify and resolve any barriers to successful implementation of the full study. This task area will also encompass pilot efforts as required for new or additional specimen and data collections.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.	Task Area 3:</strong></span> Recruitment, Follow-up and Retention. Task Area 3 will involve full-scale recruitment and follow-up of participants. Eligible health plan members will be invited to participate and enroll; baseline collections will include completion of an online questionnaire and donation of biological samples (including, but not limited to, blood,urine, and an oral sample), and collection of discard clinical samples. This task area will also include activities specific to participant engagement and retention. Task Area 3 shall also encompass development and/or modification and validation of algorithms to abstract exposure, confounder, and disease outcomes data from electronic medical records, administration of online follow-up questionnaire(s), and collection of serial biospecimens.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4.	Task Area 4:</strong></span> Ancillary Data and Biospecimen Collection.  Task Area 4 will involve additional collection of biological specimens  and data collection (e.g. physical activity measured by smartphones or wearable devices) and/or ancillary studies on all participants or a subset of participants.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5.	Task Area 5:</strong></span> Contract Closeout/Transition.  Task Area 5 will include all study closeout and transition activities.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a multiple award IDIQ with a base period of ten years.  The NAICS Code is 541990.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

Small business participation is the collective small business participation from any type of small business or sub-category small business. Work self-performed by a small business prime offeror will be credited as Small Business Participation.&nbsp; The government will evaluate the proposals to determine which offeror(s) propose the best value in terms of meeting all the Small Business Participation goals using the following criteria:</p>
<p>(a) The extent of participation of small business prime offerors and small business subcontractors in terms of the percentage of the value of the total acquisition. The mandatory minimum goals for Small Business participation is 10% of total contract dollars (aggregate of all small businesses participation including the small business socioeconomic contracting programs (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs). The following are non-mandatory suggested goals which should be determined through market research:<br />1. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 5% of total contract dollars.<br />2. Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) 5% of total contract dollars.<br />3. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) 3% of total contract dollars. <br />4. Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) 3% of total contract dollars.<br />(b)The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically identified in proposals; <br /><br />(c) The extent of commitment to use such firms (existing and enforceable commitments will be considered more favorably than business relationships that are simply planned or theoretical); <br /><br />(d) Identification of the complexity and variety of the work specific small firms are to perform;<br /><br />All Offerors (both large and small businesses) are required to complete the following Small Business Participation Plan Form and submit with their proposal.

<p>Additional Important Note for Other than U.S. Small Businesses ONLY.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 52.219-9, if a large business is selected for a contract it must submit acceptable subcontracting plans to be eligible for award. Those firms required to submit subcontracting plans are expected to conduct market research to determine appropriate subcontracting goals. A subcontracting plan is separate from the Small Business Participation plan and must meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan). SUBCONTRACTING PLANS SHALL REFLECT AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTAL CONTRACT DOLLAR COMMITMENTS OFFERED IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN</p>
<p>(i) <br />Ample opportunity will exist for subcontracting with all types of small businesses including SDB, WOSB, HZ, and SDVOSB firms. By providing subcontracting opportunities to small business, the large businesses both formally and informally mentor these businesses by helping them gain experience and increase their ability to perform at a higher level. This in turn helps the small business grow as a company and independently compete for larger projects as prime contractors or upper tier subcontractors.</p>

<DESC>I.  IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOCUMENT AS A ?LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION.?
This requirement is being issued by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Headquarters Procurement Services located in Washington, DC on behalf of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).
This DOE Limited Source Justification (LSJ) is issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) ?Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized?.  The DOE intends to noncompetitively issue a three (3) month extension with an additional three (3) month option period for Task Order DE-DT0012292 with System 1, Inc. (System 1), to provide Information Assurance (IA) support services.  Task Order DE-DT0012292 supports the IA requirements, including Assessment and Authorization requirements, for the OCIO and numerous Headquarters (HQ) based stakeholders including Office of Management (MA), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CF), Energy Information Administration (EIA), and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).
II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.
The current period of performance for the current IA Task Order is from September 29, 2016 - September 28, 2017. The DOE intends to extend the current Task Order by (3) months with an option for an additional (3) months if necessary. The period of performance for the extension period will be from September 29, 2017 - December 28, 2017.  If the three (3) month option period is exercised the period of performance will extend to March 28, 2018.
This action will allow IA services to continue uninterrupted while procurement litigates a protest.  An award was made to Edgewater Federal Solutions on July 14, 2017 with work to begin on July 31, 2017.  A GAO protest was filed with respect to that award on July 24, 2017.  DOE is taking corrective action and will be issuing a new award.
	 III. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE).
The current Task Order provides mission critical IA support services at the major headquarters facilities and operating locations in the Washington, DC area (DOE HQ).  The purpose of the IA Task Order is cybersecurity improvement support, including Assessment and Authorization for IT systems. Under this proposed action, the scope of work will not be modified. 
IV.  THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE AND, IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.
Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6.  However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of FSS contractors to fewer than required in 8.405-2.  The applicable authority is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) ?Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized?. 
System 1 is the incumbent contractor and provides trained and qualified personnel to support cyber security improvement related to DOE information technology systems. The incumbent contractor is currently the only contractor can address the potential threats to the DOE environment and possesses working knowledge of the DOE IT infrastructure in the time frame required. System 1 is the only source capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required immediately. 
 The DOE requires additional time to complete corrective action and make a new award subsequent to the protest filed by System 1 on July 24, 2017. An attempt to issue a Task Order with another entity to perform IA Support Services, on a temporary, short term basis while taking corrective action and making a new award is impracticable and would adversely affect the Department of Energy?s mission.
The DOE is at risk of potentially jeopardizing national security for current tasks that are classified in nature if an extension is not issued.  As the incumbent contractor, System 1 is the only uniquely qualified contractor that can provide continued IA support services without an interruption in service while a new award is made and finalized.
V.  A DETERMINATION BY THE ORDERING ACTIVITY CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(D). System 1?s price proposal will be evaluated in accordance with the labor category rates published in GSA schedule GS-35F-0571V.  The contracting officer has determined that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).  The rates published in GS-35F-0571V are already considered fair and reasonable under 8.404(d).  
VI.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED.
Market research was not conducted for the extension.  Due to the critical nature of this requirement, the Government has determined that it would create a security risk to transition to a separate contractor to provide Information Assurance services for only three to six months while corrective action is completed and a new award issued. Market research was conducted for Solicitation DE-SOL-0009102 and a competitive award is anticipated to be awarded once the corrective action period is completed. 
VII.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THIS JUSTIFICATION. 
None.
VIII.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE.
There are no barriers to competition that the DOE may remove. This requirement was re-competed under Solicitation DE-SOL-0009102.
IX.	EVIDENCE THAT ANY SUPPORTING DATA THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TECHNICAL OR REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL (E.G., VERIFYING THE GOVERNMENT?S MINIMUM NEEDS OR REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER RATIONALE FOR LIMITED SOURCES) AND WHICH FORM A BASIS FOR THE JUSTIFICATION HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS COMPLETE AND ACCURATE BY THE TECHNICAL OR REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL.
Not Applicable.

<p>1.1 Background. The Gavins Point Project is a multi-purpose U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Water Resource Development Project. One of the missions of the Gavins Point Project is environmental stewardship on public lands managed by USACE. The purpose of this contract is to reduce the number of noxious Eastern Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) trees on Corps-managed lands to improve native woodland and grassland habitat and to reduce wildfire risk on project lands and neighboring lands. Approximately 55% of the property is wooded, 35% is open grassland, and the remaining 10% is a mixture of grassland and trees.</p>

<p>1.2 Scope of Work. This is a non-personal services contract to provide Eastern Red Cedar mulching/shredding services on a minimum of 32 acres (BASE - REQUIRED), and up to a maximum of 70.5 acres (BASE and OPTION areas). Services include shredding and/or mulching of both live and dead Eastern Red Cedar Trees within the designated work area units in accordance with all contract specifications. All Eastern Red Cedar trees standing or down, alive or dead shall be mulched within the designated work units. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. This is a fixed priced, performance based service contract where the Government defines and measures desired outcomes, while contractor methods are generally not constrained or directed. The Government maintains the right to award all, some or none of the option are units. The Contractor shall successfully complete all work within all awarded work units upon notice of award within the period of performance.</p>
<p>1.3 Period of Performance. The Contractor shall have from 18 September 2017 until 31 December 2017 to complete all services in accordance with contract specifications, after receiving notice of contract award. The time state for completion includes final cleanup of the premises and removal of all Contractor's equipment, materials and supplies. If adverse weather conditions or any other unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of the contract work within the allotted time frame, the Contactor shall be required to document and submit in writing to the Contracting Officer a request for contract time extension which must document the cause(s) for the contracted work not being completed on time. Approval of any contract extension shall be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>1.4 Contractor Personnel</p>
<p>1.4.1 The contractor shall perform all work under this contract using his or her own forces except as provided in Paragraph 1.4.2 Subcontracting. Employees who perform this work shall be qualified persons on the contractor's own payroll.</p>
<p>1.4.1.1 The Contractor and his/her employees shall be skilled in and capable of performing the work under this contract. The Contractor and all contractor personnel shall be at least 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>1.4.1.2 All Contractor vehicles and equipment shall be registered, licensed and insured to meet all State and local laws.</p>
<p>1.4.2 Subcontracting. The contractor shall not subcontract any work without written approval of the Contracting Officer. Compliance with the provisions of this contract by subcontractors shall be the responsibility of the contractor. <br /><br />1.5 Quality Control</p>
<p>1.5.1 The contractor shall designate, in writing, an employee who shall serve as the contact for matters involving quality and performance or nonperformance of the required work stated in this PWS. The employee(s) shall be qualified and fully competent with full authority to act for, and on behalf of, the contractor as necessary to insure that the required work is performed in accordance with the standards contained herein. The contractor shall furnish the above written designation to the Government Point of Contact (GPOC) no later than the first day of work. The contractor shall include the name(s), address(s), and telephone number(s) of the responsible individual(s).</p>
<p>1.5.2 The Contracting Officer reserves the right to disapprove any individual whom he considers incompetent to perform the work required. The Contracting Officer will provide a written notice of any disapproval to the contractor.</p>
<p>1.6 Quality Assurance. The Government will use a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to ensure that the Contractor is performing the services required by this PWS in an acceptable manner. The Government may use Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE(s)) to provide assistance with the quality assurance methods.</p>
<p>1.6.1 The Government has the right to inspect all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections in a manner that will not delay the work.</p>

<p><br />FAR Subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items - Sole Source Justification and Approval</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity: Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC- APG), Huachuca Division, 2133 Cushing Street, Building 61801, Room 3212, Fort Huachuca, Arizona 85613-7070.<br />2. Description of Action: The Network Enterprise Center (NEC), Fort Hood, Texas requests to award a sole source contract providing support to Fort Hood Network Enterprise Center (NEC) in management, operations, and maintenance of the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system. The requirement will consist of a twelve-month base period beginning 30 September 2017 and ending 29 September 2018 including four (4) one-year option periods. Funding for this requirement will be provided using Operation<br />&amp; Maintenance, Army (OMA) Fiscal Year 17 funds.</p>
<p>This action is a follow-on to contract. In previous years, this action was awarded as a Sole Source contract under the justification that Harris Corporation is the manufacturer and designer of the current LMR system on Fort Hood, and that only Harris Corporation can provide factory level support. Harris Corporation circuit boards, software updates, and security software patches are only available through Harris Corporation as Harris Corporation owns all the proprietary rights to the software.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The Fort Hood, Texas Network Enterprise Center (NEC) requirement provides on-site personnel performing backbone System Maintenance Services including labor and parts for the P25 LMR system with four (4) hour response times for critical infrastructure failures from time of notification by customer until a technician is on-site. Upon notification the technician may commence remote dial up access troubleshooting (if available) to make an initial assessment and possibly initiate a temporary work around solution. Even if dial-up troubleshooting is initiated, the on-site response time will remain at four (4) hours. Nonemergency issues response times shall be within 24 hours. Backbone Maintenance Service includes Harris Corporation, which shall provide all required warranty specified replacement maintenance parts and maintenance personnel to manage the Fort Hood owned Critical Spares Inventory located at Fort Hood.</p>
<p>Maintaining an active Software FX Agreement with Harris Corporation provides the NEC systems with software updates. The NEC specialists will review and approve for installation in accordance with the detailed plan defining the upgrade processes, order of installation, testing and tailback plans, system verification, and operation and effectiveness of the software upgrades.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFARS 5153.303-5, the estimated total value is as follows:</p>
<p>Base Period: 30 September 2017 to 29 September 2018 Value: <br />Option Period I: 30 September 2018 to 29 September 2019 Value: <br />Option Period II: 30 September 2019 to 29 September 2020 Value: <br />Option Period III: 30 September 2020 to 29 September 2021 Value: <br />Option Period IV: 30 September 2021 to 29 September 2022 Value: <br />Total:</p>
<p>Authority Cited: Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, 41 U.S.C. 1901 as implemented by FAR Subpart 13.5: Exclusive licensing agreements</p>
<p>4. Reason for Authority Cited:<br />a) Harris Corporation is the manufacturer, designer, and proprietor of Fort Hood NEC's P25 LMR system and no other contractor can perform the support on this system due to the age of the system, proprietary information, availability of parts, and proprietary software prepared and tested on Harris System Release (SR) Systems.<br />As stated above, Harris Corporation is the manufacturer, designer, and proprietor of Fort Hood NEC's P25 LMR system, and no other contractor can perform the support on this system due to the age of the system, proprietary information, availability of parts, and proprietary software prepared and tested on Harris System Release (SR) Systems. The updates are only available directly from Harris Corporation, as other contractors do not offer integration testing and patches specific to the LMR system at Fort Hood. To replace the old Harris system, the cost is estimated. It would take a minimum of a year to implement. During that time, the current LMR system would still need maintenance.</p>
<p>Background: LMR system maintenance was originally provided by Harris through the original installation contract. A follow on contract was awarded to provide maintenance. The follow on contract was for a base year and three one year options as follows</p>
<p>Base Year: 1 July 2013 - 30 June 2014<br />Option Year I: 1 July 2014 - 30 June 2015<br />Option Year II: 1 July 2015 - 30 June 2016<br />Option Year III: 1 July 2016 - 30 June 2017</p>
<p>An extension of services under FAR 52.217-8 was issued from 1 July 2017 - 30 September 2017</p>
<p>All option years of the follow-on contract have been exercised.<br />b) Alternative<br />&bull; Purchase new LMR System: Replacing the current LMR system at Fort Hood Network Enterprise Center is not cost effective at this time and strains resources such as funding, time, compatibility, and labor. Fort Hood is currently not on an upgrade list. Maintenance must continue or the post will run the risk of no communication available for EMS personnel.<br />&bull; Compete the maintenance: There were no actions taken to compete maintenance; since Harris Corporation is the only vendor with rights to its own software, as they do not sell their software to other vendors. <br />&bull; Discontinue Maintenance: Without the LMR system maintenance contract, software and security updates would not happen, resulting in the user equipment and network open to potential threats, risking the availability of communications to police, fire and EMS personnel.<br />&bull; Impact: Without factory level support, repairs, software and security updates would not happen, resulting in potential threats to the user equipment and network, risking the availability of communications to police, fire, and EMS personnel. The LMR system is the predominant public safety communication system on Fort Hood and is relied upon all hours of the day by emergency personnel, law enforcement and others to minimize their situation risks related to life, health and/or saftey issues.</p>
<p>5. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Since Harris Corporation is the only vendor authorized to work on their equipment, ACC-APG did not make any effort to obtain competition; however, a special notice as required by FAR 5.201, for a sole source contract was posted to the Federal Opportunities website (FedBizOpps) on 31 August 2017, and made available for public inspection and comment. The closing date for the synopsis is 05 September 2017.</p>
<p>6. Actions to Increase Competition: If there is any future LMR system maintenance requirement, every effort will be afforded to compete to the maximum extent possible to alleviate long-term sole source dependency. The requiring activity will conduct continued market research reviewing the commercial marketplace for any vendors to provide these LMR services on current equipment, as well as equipment replacement to a more competitive environment.</p>
<p>7. Market Research: Market research shows Harris Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the service and repair parts for Harris radios, and the only vendor with rights to its own software, as they do not sell their software to other vendors. Harris is the only vendor authorized to work on their equipment. On 08 September 2017, Harris Corporation provided a documentation supporting this sole source determination. Per Harris Corporation, they developed the software that runs its LMR systems entirely at private expense and therefore, owns all intellectual property rights thereto. To the best of their knowledge, Harris is the only party authorized to provide the specific comprehensive maintenance features included with its FX Software agreement. Harris does not sell its software to other vendors.</p>
<p>8. Interested Sources: Harris Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the service and repair parts for Harris radios.</p>
<p>9. Other Facts:<br />Procurement History:<br />The following are the Contract Numbers for the last several years for the same requirement:</p>
<p>In previous years, this action was awarded as a Sole Source contract under the justification that Harris Corporation is the manufacturer and designer of the current LMR system on Fort Hood and that only Harris Corporation can provide factory level support. In addition, Harris Corporation circuit boards, software updates, and security software patches are only available through Harris Corporation as Harris Corporation owns all the proprietary rights to the software.</p>
<p>10. Technical Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which is included in the justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Management Analyst</p>
<p>11. Requirement Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Management Analyst</p>
<p>12. Fair and Reasonable Price Determination: I hereby determine that the anticipated cost or price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable. Price analysis techniques per FAR 15.404-1 will be used in performing the price analysis. Price analysis will clearly demonstrate that the proposed price is reasonable in comparison with current or recent prices for the same or similar services. Certified cost and pricing data is not required because the service being acquired is considered commercial.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />Approval</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve the procurement of Land Mobile Radio (LMR) System Maintenance on a sole source basis pursuant to the authority of the Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, 41 U.S.C. 1901 as implemented by FAR Subpart 13.5 provided that the services herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.</p>

<DESC>1. Identify the agency and contracting activity.
<p>This justification is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, Maryland on behalf of Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX (NHCCC), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NHJ) and Naval Hospital Pensacola (NHP) hereafter referred to as the medical treatment facility (MTF).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action/contract type.</p>
<p>Loyal Source Government Services, LLC. (LSGS) under current contract N62645-15-D-5015 is providing firm fixed priced task orders for Ancillary medical services in support of the identified MTF's.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies/services.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing MRI Technician (2 Individuals) and Certified Medical Assistant (4 Individuals) services in support of NHJ under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0001 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Pharmacist (5 Individuals) and Pharmacy Technician (10 Individuals) services in support of NHJ under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0002 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Phlebotomist (1 Individuals) and Physical Therapy Assistant (2 Individuals) services in support of NHJ under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0003 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Certified Medical Assistant (4 Individuals) in support of NHCCC under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0004 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Pharmacist (2 Individuals) and Pharmacy Technician (8 Individuals) services in support of NHP under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0005 with a current period of performance of 01 October 2016-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Pharmacist (5 Individuals) and Pharmacy Technician (10 Individuals) services in support of NHCCC under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0006 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Clinical Pharmacist (1 Individual) services in support of NHJ under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0007 with a current period of performance of 01 February 2017-30 September 2017.</p>
<p>LSGS is currently providing Certified Medical Assistant (1 Individual) services in support of NHP under current task order N62645-15-D-5015-0008 with a current period of performance of 01 October 2016-30 September 2017.</p>
<p><br />The government intends to execute a bilateral modification to the aforementioned task orders by adding option periods to allow for the healthcare services to continue at the Medical Treatment Facilities while the successor contracts are being awarded to align with the base contract ordering period extension. A modification will be completed to add these options at the task order level in lieu of creating separate task order proposal requests (TOPRs). In addition to the inclusion of these options at the task order level, FAR clause 52.217-9 is currently included in the task orders. Further, the added option period will be exercised under the aforementioned task orders. This modification will be executed bilaterally utilizing the changes clause under FAR 52.243-1 (Alt. 1).</p>
<p>The estimated value of adding options for the aforementioned services is $2,678,937.56.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the exception to fair opportunity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FAR 16.505(B)(2)(i)(C) states that, "The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order." Options are being added to the aforementioned task orders instead of issuing TOPRs due to the administrative ease of adding options. This requirement was originally competed in accordance with the applicable contract ordering procedures. Due to the nature of the acquisition for services currently being performed by the contractor under this MATO, it is in the best interest of the Government to negotiate option periods allowing for the most effective use of resources. Recompeting the services currently being filled would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Such costs include the time of technical and contracting personnel to review and evaluate the requirement, proposal and task order; as well as the costs associated with re-credentialing if a new contractor is chosen. No other vendors under this MATO will be disadvantaged as these services were originally competed with the applicable contract ordering procedures. The option periods will be added to the aforementioned task orders based on there being no change in scope to the current requirement and no changes to the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable for the additional option periods, the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer will review the proposed price against current market research information available. If the contractor's proposed price appears to be questionable for reasonableness, a justification from the contractor will be required in order to determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer will determine the price to be fair and reasonable before adding the additional option periods.</p>
<p>6. Any other facts supporting the justification.</p>
<p>This contractor is successfully providing services and has already worked through recruitment costs and has established a system for tracking and providing staff that works well at the requiring MTF. Changing contractors could require a complete change in current staff, adding the costs associated with reviewing new credentialing packages and conducting orientation (during which time no services are provided).</p>
<p>7. Statement of actions to remove or overcome barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity.</p>
<p>At this time there are no actions being taken to remove or overcome barriers leading to the exception to fair opportunity under this contract. The current contractor is successfully providing services under this contract. If the contractor does not continue to perform successful services under this contract, then it is possible that these services would be recompeted to all contractors under this MATO through a future competitive task order proposal request (TOPR) to allow contractors to propose pricing and competitively be awarded a task order.</p>

The purpose of the study is to gather enough building and corresponding human physiological data to be able to determine what building design factors can be attributed to positive health outcomes of building occupants.&nbsp;&nbsp;J&amp;A was conducted because the work under Option Period 4 was not negotiated in price under original award.

<DESC>The original Task Order, Fragility and Conflict Technical and Research Services (FACTRS), was designed to assist USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance, Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (DCHA/CMM) to meet a core function: provide cutting-edge, highest quality, evidence-based applied research and analysis on fragility, conflict, and violence in order to enable USAID policies and programs to reflect state-of-the-art thinking, and be effective and innovative.
<p>The purpose of this task order modification for follow-on services is to&nbsp;build upon the completed research work under FACTRS and extend this research to enable it to respond to recent developments and allow it to be further operationalized for application and use by the Agency, Interagency and external stakeholders. The scope of work will also allow the Agency to continue to respond to emerging or urgent technical topics related to conflict, fragility and violence in the most efficient manner, making use of the research infrastructure and networks already developed through collaboration with the contractor under the original FACTRS Task Order.</p>
