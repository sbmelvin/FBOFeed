The program, which will be available through the TSI web site, will provide on-going motor carrier safety training relative to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) located in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (49CFR)*.  [* In this document, the term FMCSR is used interchangeably with the terms Title 49 and 49CFR.]  The FMCSR contain regulations that must be followed by more than 600,000 motor carriers throug! hout the U.S.  The proposed partnership will require TSI to nationally market the training programs developed under this agreement and to confer TSI certification on successfully completed training.  The vendor will be responsible for hosting the training program and administering all aspects of the training.  TSI will be responsible for course content and maintaining subject matter support.  The vendor will have authority to establish the market price for the program fees and tuition and will retain all profits minus an administration fee, which shall be returned to TSI.  The vendor will recover development costs from sales revenue collected at tuition costs.  It is likely that the training program developed under this agreement will represent a first-time experience with e-learning for many potential users.  Accordingly, the instructional and navigational design should be sensitive to novice users.  Programs must incorporate audio/visual elements and a high level of intera! ctivity that reinforce the content. It is also expected that many users may desire access from home using 56K modems. Consequently, both 56K and broadband access should be considered when designing the programs.  TSI presently offers a 40-hour instructor led course covering these sections/topics.  TSI will provide lesson plans, resource materials, PowerPoint presentations, and a current issue of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Management Edition, containing the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, to the vendor selected to implement the Internet based training program.  This requirement must also comply with the Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The standards can be located at www.access-based.gov/sec508/508standards.htm.  The specific standard is 36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1194, Subpart B, Section 22, Web-based Internet and Internet Information and Applications.  All interested vendors that would like to be considered shall be required!  to attend a pre-proposal conference to be held on December 4, 2002, in Oklahoma City, at the Transportation Safety Institute’s North Campus facility, 4400 Will Rogers Parkway, suite 222, classroom B, starting at 1:00 pm Central Time.  Vendors may register no more than two representatives (must be U.S. Citizens) to attend the conference.  A determination has been made making this a 100% small business set-aside, NAICS Code 611710 size standard is $6 million.  Only business meeting this requirement will be solicited for this requirement.  Please provide names and any questions and comments by FAX or Email (brent.d.foreman@faa.gov), to Brent D.

<DESC>NA 1.0  INTRODUCTION.  The Defense Contracting Command Washington, on the behalf of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), in concert with the Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to acquire Information Support Services for the recompete of the Defen se System Intergration, Design, Development, Operation and Maintenance Support (D/SIDDOMS).   In order to accomplish this effort the following types of services, equipment, materials, and facilities will be required to design, develop, procure, integrate, test, train, deploy, operate, and maintain Military Health System (MHS) systems and system components and similar programs for other federal agencies with a health care mission.  This contract includes services necessary for the contractor to manage its ow n staff, resources, products, and schedules in performing work, but specifically excludes any services to support the MHS in planning or managing MHS programs or offices. 1.1.   EXTERNAL FEDERAL AGENCY USAGE.  In addition to the mission of the TRICARE Management Activity, this contract may be used to acquire services within the scope of the statement of work for other DOD and non-DOD agencies with a health care mission at t he discretion of the Acquisition Management Division (AMD) and the Defense Contracting Command – Washington (DCC-W). 1.2.   BACKGROUND. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for the operation of TRICARE as the worldwide, integrated system for accessible, high quality and cost effective delivery of health care services to Department of Defense (DoD) benefic iaries during peacetime and wartime.  The MHS provides medical support for the full range of military deployments and peacetime support to members of the Armed Forces, their families, and others to advance our national security interests. The mission of th e MHS is to provide and to maintain readiness, and to provide healthcare services and support to members of the Armed Forces during military operations.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)/TRICARE Management Activity (OASD (HA)/TMA) has a requirement to provide support to the MHS in applying the principles of DoD information and technology management by developing and implemen ting policies, procedures, programs, and technical standards necessary to acquire, manage, integrate, and secure information technology systems and capabilities that support the delivery of high quality, cost effective health care services across the opera tional continuum.  The TMA/DCC-W D/SIDDOMS III contract will be a tool used to support TMA in the execution of its vast mission. The MHS provides comprehensive healthcare for all Armed Forces personnel, their families, and other individuals eligible for care.  The MHS Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) Program supports the MHS by closely aligning its priorities an d processes with the MHS mission, vision, goals, and strategies.  The MHS IM/IT Program continues to evolve through the development of capabilities in the following six functionally integrated programs:  The Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO),  The Defense Medical Logistics System Support (DMLSS) Program Office,  The Resources Information Technology Program Office (RITPO),  The Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) Program Office,  The Theater Medical Information Program Office (TMIP), and  The Technology Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO). It is through these areas that the MHS IM/IT Program will fully integrate its information systems to support the MHS goals and strategies in support of readiness, TRICARE, and preventive healthcare initiatives.  It continues to move toward its goal of cons olidating over 100 legacy systems into a single migration system to support each of these functional areas. The integrated program structure ensures full integration of the MHS into the defense information infrastructure and full compliance with the te chnical standards of the common operating environment.  The MHS IM/IT Program has made substantial progress in its delivery of real-time information through the adaptation of emerging technologies and reengineering initiatives. 2.0  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for repair services of nine radio components with various estimated annual quantities.  Motorola, acquired by General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS), was the original manufacturer of these radio components.  This radio equipment is required for use in air to ground communication systems.  An indefinite delivery/requirements type contract for one year with options to renew for four additional 1-year periods is contemplated.   <P> GDDS is the only known responsible source of supply for repair services, since they have proprietary rights to the original design and technical data.  The FAA does not have the technical data needed to provide to any other vendor.   <P> Any concern desiring to become a source for FAA repair requirements is requested to provide a complete documentation package to the contracting officer, FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, NAS Acquisition Contracting Team, AMQ-210, P.O. Box 25082, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK, 73125-4929.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, test bed facility, and copies of the test procedures, specifications and equipment listings applicable to the item as well as access to replacement parts necessary to effect the repairs.   <P> Any information received as a result of this market survey will not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether an additional source may be approved for the repair of the radio components.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal. <P>

Failure to receive a passing score for any technical evaluation factor may result in rejection of an offeror's proposal notwithstanding passing scores for other technical factors unless the offeror is determined to be in the competitive range for the purpose of conducting negotiations on the proposal.  Evaluating each responsive proposal and comparing the results of that evaluation against the technical requirements specified in this solicitation will determine technical acceptability.  Proposals, which satisfy the technical requirements of the solicitation, in light of the evaluation criteria, will be determined technically acceptable.

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS
This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided
under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA
requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building
information per the solicitation.
REASONABLE CARE:
1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon
determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.
Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or
with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as
architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair
contractors and equipment service contractors.
NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that
the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:
Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid
identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each
dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:
(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local
jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone
number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act
for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s
license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases
where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and
testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or
certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun &
Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and
(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,
(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.
Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s)
picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU
documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time
of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.
2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of
the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal
purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized
use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after
completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and
removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract
and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record
copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded
against unauthorized use for the term of retention.
4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall
provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents,
with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.
Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals
process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from
computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents
and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable
and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building
information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Prime Contractor, in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, manage a Project entitled National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX).  The Project goal is to develop, fabricate and commission by June 2007 a Compact Stellarator for fusion energy research.  Manufacturing development activities for critical components of NCSX are scheduled to begin in early calendar year 2003.  In preparation for this, PPPL is seeking firms to compete on a best value basis for two Subcontracts to be awarded for manufacturing development activities for the NCSX vacuum vessel.  The NCSX vacuum vessel is a three-fold symmetric toroid with highly shaped poloidal cross-sections.  The vessel is to be fabricated primarily of alloy (UNS 06625) and is configured in three 120 degree segments with bolted joints between them.  The requiremens of the manufacturing development Subcontracts include manufacturing studies and the production of a full scale segment of the vessel.  The use of vacuum vessel manufacturing development / prototype fabrication Subcontracts has been selected to focus on critical aspects of manufacturing the vacuum vessel, that is, complex geometry, accurate location and fabrication of vessel ports, tolerance control, production of vacuum quality welds with low distortion and timely low-cost fabrication of the vessel.  PPPL anticipates the follow-on vacuum vessel production Subcontract would be awarded to one of the manufacturing development Subcontractors.  Statements of interest should be sent to Larry L. Sutton, e-mail lsutton@pppl.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. EPA intends to award a sole source purchase order to The Cadmus Group as a follow-on requirement which, if performed by any other source, would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government not expected to be recovered by competition.  Through providing over 3 years of previous technical support for this project (under a competitively awarded task order) Cadmus has gained significant and unique knowledge about PEMS, portable analyzers, gas-fired turbines and associated control systems.  They have also obtained participation in the  project by several PEMS and portable analyzer vendors, which might be adversely affected by a change in contractor.  This effort is expected to be completed in 6 months.  The goal of this requirement is the determination of robustness and accuracy of PEMS systems and of portable NOx analyzers as a  lower cost alternative to continuous emission monitoring systems.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification is being posted to correct the response date for this BAA.  Although the initial evaluation phase has closed, the BAA shall remain open until October 30, 2003.  The content of the BAA that follows remains unchanged from the previous version.

PROGRAM COMPOSITION OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (PCES), SOL BAA 02-25, DUE: 10/30/02; POC: DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161 PROGRAM SCOPE The objective of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems (PCES) is to create new language and compiler technology for developing distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications that reduces complexity by separating application functional concerns (such as exploitation algorithms, rules of engagement processing, or weapons targeting) from cross-cutting systemic concerns (such as synchronization of concurrent operations, processor fault isolation, sensor input and actuator output timing constraints, distribution, and safe/efficient cache, register, and memory management). The Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter/Weapons (SDMS/W) kill chain used to prosecute Time Critical Targets (TCTs) is an excellent example of DRE systems and their need for highly flexible, dependable, and efficient software. The kill chain refers to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process used by an Air Operations Center (AOC) to commit strike resources against a TCT. All of these operations must be accomplished within a short time window to destroy elusive mobile targets. Since attack maneuvering and the weapon alignment and fly out consume most of the time interval, the actual strike decision must be made by the legal authorities and relayed to the pilot and/or weapon within seconds of combat identification of the target. The PCES program addresses the following factors that have historically increased software fragility and total ownership costs and imperiled the success of numerous new and planned DoD programs: 1. Multiple platform and varying operational contexts. DoD systems must invest an ever-increasing proportion of functionality in DRE software to retain technological dominance. Rapidly emerging technologies and flexibility required for diverse operational contexts force deployment of multiple versions of software on various platform architectures, while preserving key properties, such as secure, dependable, and real-time response. 2. Total ownership costs. Software development and evolution is labor-intensive and error-prone for complex DoD DRE systems and can represent over 50% of the total ownership costs of these systems. 3. Obsolescence trends. Incommensurate lifetimes between DoD systems (20 years or more) and computational platform (2-5 years) lead to pervasive software obsolescence and multiply the total ownership costs by requiring periodic software re-development and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) refresh. This BAA solicits proposals in two research categories, "Open Experimentation Platform (OEP) Developer" and "Technology Developer." Offerors in both categories must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort. The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration. OEP Developer The OEP Developer supplies the PCES program with specific challenge problems that must describe the current operational state in the domain of Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter (SDMS/W) systems, and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP developer will also integrate PCES technologies into the SDMS/W testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs). The primary emphasis of this experimental evaluation is the quality (both at design time and at run-time) of the PCES DRE middleware. In that capacity, the OEP developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the PCES DRE middleware and representative SDMS/W applications in terms of their flexibility, correctness, latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, and optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, SDMS/W applications, and the integrated SDMS/W testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the PCES program. Proposers in the OEP Developer category should propose a SDMS/W software test platform of interest to the Armed Services, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based. Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate PCES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks. Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the SDMS/W constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for PCES experiments based on their OEP. It is anticipated that no more than one proposal will be selected in this area for possible funding. Technology Developer Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the SDMS/W testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above. The two TD topical areas are described below: Topic 1. DRE Middleware Generation and Optimization Tools DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop languages, algorithms, patterns, and code bases to support the generation and optimization of DRE middleware that can be customized for specific mission requirements and constraints of DoD SDMS/W systems and applications. The middleware will be generated automatically and optimized via algorithms that can be tailored declaratively to adapt to key DRE platform characteristics, e.g., interconnection mechanisms, event demultiplexing mechanisms, I/O mechanisms, synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, failure detection and recovery mechanisms, configuration mechanisms, and power levels. Automating the configuration and optimization of DRE middleware is essential since the need for stringent behavioral assurance makes verification and empirical validation of the customized middleware components necessary. Moreover, these capabilities will ensure that DoD systems can leverage standards-based COTS while simultaneously ensuring that key protocol, implementation, and QoS properties can remain unique in order to retain superiority over adversaries who have access to the same standards-based COTS middleware. Proposers of new DRE middleware generation and optimization tools should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to DRE developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time performance goals, cross-cutting aspects, and/or open middleware standards. Proposals should discuss the importance and prevalence of these features in the context of DRE middleware and SDMS/W systems. Proposers should also be able to interface to other PCES components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project). The interfaces and functional semantics of all DRE middleware generation and optimization tools will be required to be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards PCES is developing and leveraging. Tools developed for PCES will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other tools and with standards-based middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts. Any number of different tools may be proposed in a given proposal, though each proposal must comply with all submission requirements including page limits given in this PIP. Each DRE middleware generation and optimization tool proposed should be structured as a unique, separately priced task option so that a subset of those tools proposed might be targeted for funding. One or more tool options may be targeted for funding from a given proposal, though it is anticipated that no more than four DRE middleware generation and optimization proposals will be selected for possible funding and teaming is encouraged. Topic 2. Distributed Quality Aspects DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, technology, and tools for applying aspect-oriented techniques to DRE middleware and applications. In particular, DARPA is seeking innovative techniques that can collect, organize, and disseminate QoS-related meta-information needed to (1) monitor and manage how well the functional interactions occur in SDMS/W systems and (2) enable the decision-making needed to support systemic QoS properties robustly in the face of rapidly changing SDMS/W mission requirements and environmental conditions. These middleware capabilities are crucial to ensure that the aggregate behavior of complex network-centric SDMS/W systems is dependable, despite local failures, transient overloads, and dynamic functional or QoS reconfigurations. Proposals for distributed quality aspects should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture and the process via which PCES will integrate technologies with it. To promote a common technology base, the interfaces and (where appropriate) the protocols used by PCES middleware should be based on (or should guide) established or emerging industry or DoD standards that are relevant for DoD DRE systems. However, the aspect-oriented technologies developed in the PCES program should also be customizable?statically and dynamically?for specific DoD DRE application and mission requirements. Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG and The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for PCES middleware interoperability. It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated. Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods. Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors. Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing. The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration. This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA?s release. GENERAL INFORMATION The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/ixo/index.asp?BAAid=02-25 After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page. Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the "original" and each designated number of copies. The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract/Proposal. If a proposer intends to submit more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet. Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated. Proposers are advised that the Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IXO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report. These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IXO Technical ? Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW). Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP). PROPOSAL FORMAT Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-25, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2. The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON Local Time, Wednesday, 10/30/02, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase. However, BAA 02-25, Program Composition of Embedded Systems (PCES), will remain open until 12:00 NOON Local Time, Thursday, 10/30/03. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Thursday, 10/30/03. While the proposals submitted after Wednesday, 10/30/02, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule. Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats. This Pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/pces/index.htm. Proposals not meeting the format described in the Pamphlet may not be reviewed. This Announcement, in conjunction with the BAA 02-25 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer". An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories only.

This request is for informational planning purposes only and is important for establishment of a realistic cost estimate.

Identify any factors that would affect the prices quoted, and specify equipment and technical data that would be needed to support training (inclusive of stock number, part number, noun description, T.O. numbers, description of manuals and software).  Also, specify whether said items would be Contractor or Government furnished.  For performance in overseas areas, please identify logistical and administrative support required for your instructors. 
	
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1.  Scope

a.  Training is required by the USAF in support of an Egyptian Air Force (EAF) foreign military sales program, Peace Vector VI.  Proposed training will be Type 1 contractor training, procured by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and presented under the auspices of Air Force Security Assistance Training Program.

	b.  Operator and maintenance training shall be on the Fixed Oxygen/Nitrogen Plant built for Peace Vector VI Foreign Military Sales Program.

2.  Technical Training

Technicians shall be provided knowledge and skills necessary to succeed as operators and maintainers of the fixed plant.

b.  The contractor shall provide course outlines detailing major topics/assemblies and the hours required to train four EAF technicians.

Primary emphasis shall be "hands-on" practical experience.  Training is desired prior to the equipment being installed in Egypt (estimated calendar-year 2003 timeframe) so that the trained students will be available during installation/set-up in Egypt.  The contractor shall specify the exact dates the training can be provided.  If the EAF's equipment is used during training, the contractor shall include costs to refurbish the equipment to a "like new" condition after training is complete.

For CONUS training the contractor shall propose transportation from and to the local airport, and from quarters to and from the training site(s).  If there are multiple training sites, the contractor shall propose transportation to those sites.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) proposes to make an award to a contractor for research tasks and software development related to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) film scans and digital data.  This project will develop the capability to bring the scanned DMSP-OLS film data into the current digital data processing stream, and will develop additional software to support the generation of nighttime lights data products.  Development on this project will include: (1) An automated capability to convert scanned film data into a file format consistent with the OLS Interleaved Smooth (OIS) format;  (2) An assessment of the accuracy of the nadir pixel geolocation of the above method;  (3) Software that labels each pixel of OIS visible data as glare, sunlit, or marginal (poleward of glare and east of the terminator); (4) additional software development as needed.  Items 1 and 2 contain a strong research component, and an initial experimental/protoyping phase is expected.  Objective:  To develop a capacity to convert Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) film scan images to a format consistent with the OLS Interleaved Smooth (OIS) format of the DMSP-OLS digital data in preparation for geolocation and regridding to assess the accuracy of the correlation between ephemeris and scanned imagery and to develop, test and deliver software for processing of DMSP nighttime lights data.  Background:  This statement of work consists of two separate but related activities.  First, the conversion of film scans into a format similar to the OIS format is in part a research activity that will culminate in the delivery of a software package.  LASON, Inc. is currently scanning portions of the DMSP-OLS film archive.  The newly scanned TIFs will be converted to a compressed image format for storage.  Previously scanned film has been stored in MrSID compressed format.  These will be converted to the new image format as well.  This contract covers the conversion of the image format into an OIS-like format.  The OIS format is defined, and consists of interleaved visible and thermal band data, as well as metadata, including ephemeris information for the nadir pixel of each scan line.  We will provide the contractor with compressed images as well as Two-Card Element sets (TCEs) for generation of ephemeris.  The scanned film contains marginal fiducial marks and time stamps that we expect will be used to match ephemeris with the film data.  The contractor is responsible for assessing the accuracy of the correlation between pixel location and ephemeris.  NGDC will provide a Project Plan to the contractor to specify further the deliverables of the tasks.  The second activity consists of the development and testing of software to support the processing of DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data.  The contractor will be expected to work within the processing stream that currently exists at NGDC.
 A software system for a Linux platform should be delivered for the first activity.  For the second activity, software should be written in IDL on a Linux platform.  Tasks:
Section A:  Conversion of scanned film to OIS-like format.  Task 1:  Gather documentation on DMSP film creation and format.  If documentation on certain aspects of the film does not exists, document what can be deduced from examination of the film.  This is a research task.  Deliverable:  Summary Report, found documentation.  Task 2:  Ensure NGDC's close involvement with the project.  This includes activities such as creating infrastructure for project visibility, documentation, such as an architecture document and a design document, and various analysis reports.  These will be generated and shared during the appropriate parts of the development process.  The contractor will also participate in reviews as necessary, including but not limited to Imaging Tool analysis, Architecture and Detailed Design.  Deliverable:  Documentation.
Task 3:  Generate ephemeris from TCEs.  The TCEs will be provided by NGDC.  The ephemeris generation model will be chosen by agreement between NGDC and the contractor.  The contractor will organize the output ephemeris into orbits, synchronizing with the orbit numbers appearing on the film labels.  Deliverables:  Ephemeris with Orbit Numbers.  Task 4:  Develop a method to correlate ephemeris to film data using fiducial marks and time stamps.  This will involve identifying the OLS edges of scan, identifying the crosshairs on the fiducial marks, and OCR of the time stamp and printed annotation where applicable.  We expect a significant portion of the hours for this task will be used to research image analysis and optical recognition methods for automated identification of fiducial marks and time stamps.   This is a research task.  Deliverable:  Report.
Task 5:  Develop a capability to resample overscanned images when creating OIS-like format.  This should be controlled by the user via a command line flag or property.  Deliverable:  Software feature.  Task 6:  Build a Linux software system that converts the film scan images to an OIS-like file format, preferably starting from compressed film scans.  The system will have two modes of operation, interactive and fully automated.  The interactive component is expected to take the form of a GUI-based tool that lets an analyst "help" the software to identify fiducial marks, time stamps, and edges of scan (see task 4).  The nature or function of the interactive component may change at the agreement of NGDC and the contractors.  The time-per-image required of an analyst for the interactive tool will be determined by agreement between NGDC and the contractor.  The fully automated mode may have a different accuracy than the interactive mode.  Deliverable:  Software.  Task 7:  Perform an accuracy analysis on the software system developed in Task 6.  If they differ, analyze the accuracy for both the interactive and fully automated modes of operation.  Deliverable:  Report.  Section B:  Software to support processing of digital nighttime lights data.  Task 8:  Modify existing software, or add software to the existing processing stream, to flag each OIS pixel for quality of its nighttime lights data.  The flags will be:  good (no flag), sunlit, glare or marginal.  Identify "glare" using existing algorithm provided by NGDC.  Identify "sunlit" using terminator information from OIS header or scan line headers.  Identify "marginal" as data poleward of glare and east of the terminator.  Deliverable:  Software. Task 9:  Additional software development as needed.  Deliverable:  Software. Vendors should submit information and references supporting the following evaluation criteria:  1.  Years of experience in developing software for processing DMSP data (15 pts).  2.  Level of experience in software development for Linux platform (10 pts).  3.  Degree of familiarity with OIS file format and semantics, including XDR/RPCGEN (30 pts). 4. Capability to generate ephemeris for DMSP satellites (20 pts).  5.  Level of experience in optical recognition of image features and annotations (20 pts).  6.  Level of familiarity with the DMSP-OLS scan geometry and other physical properties (20 pts.).  It is not the intent of the Government to issue a separate solicitation for this requirement.  Interested sources must submit a written qualifications statement by fax, clearly establishing capability to meet the above requirements.  Faxed quotes are acceptable and should be sent to 303-497-3163.  Quotes are required by December 16, 2002.  All questions should be submitted in writing either by fax or email.  This announcement/solicitation is being issued in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000).  The award will be made as a firm fixed priced purchase order.  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.  Agency level protest procedures can be found at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/#REFERENCE .  Incremental billing is acceptable.

<DESC>The Division of Ocean Sciences, National Science Foundation is seeking information to determine potential sources for a System Integration Contractor (SIC) to provide a non-riser drilling ship and associated scientific support for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  This will be a successor to the Ocean Drilling Program contract between NSF and Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc.  The ship is expected to be a conversion of an existing commercial vessel that will operate under contract charter. The SIC will manage vessel selection, acquisition and conversion for scientific drilling, as well as subsequent vessel operations and science support activities.  The SIC will also provide shipboard and shore-based technical staffs to support drilling, laboratory and other scientific activity of 25-30 person scientific teams sponsored separately by the IODP members. 

Since existing drilling vessels are not routinely equipped to meet the requirements for a scientific research program, the major focus of the conversion will be modifications to provide laboratory spaces for geochemical, geologic and biologic analysis of samples and data.  The conversion effort will also require emphasis on efficient recovery of complete coring sections.  Habitability and endurance enhancements to comfortably accommodate cruises up to 2 months duration are also a key area of importance. The United States Science Advisory Committee has undertaken a detailed study of vessel requirements based on science objectives of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Initial Science Plan, and the results of that study are available on the web at 
(www.joi-odp.org/USSSP/cdc/default.html).  The converted vessel should be consistent with the required drilling platform characteristics identified therein, and have a useful scientific lifespan of 10 years or greater.  

In addition to acquiring and managing resources necessary for basic ship operations in compliance with recognized safety and classification standards, the SIC will provide on-board scientific services including:

- Procedures and equipment for core/sample handling, including basic description, sampling, storage and shipping
- Procedures and equipment for evaluation of safety of drilling operations, including hydrocarbon and gas monitoring
- Laboratory space and equipment for core/sample measurements of paleomagnetics, physical properties, sediment and pore fluid chemistry, paleontology, petrology/hard rock analyses, geochemistry, and microbiology
- Computer capability for data capture, analysis of data and word processing
- Supplies and operational support for instrumentation and laboratory operation
- Facilities and equipment for limited site survey activity to locate/identify drilling sites
- Facilities/capability for downhole logging activity
- Special downhole tools for sampling or physical measurements
- The maintenance/replacement of equipment to maintain/upgrade operations to meet evolving scientific requirements during IODP.

The SIC will also be required to provide shore-based science support capabilities that include:

- Facilities for storage and distribution of samples and data
- Publication of appropriate reports and informational material
- Required support facilities for seagoing operations
- Support for legal requirements of operation, including identification of pertinent national and international regulations and acquisition of necessary permits for drilling activities
- Support for business management and planning, including identification of procedures to develop detailed plans for drilling activities, schedules and shipboard services, and their oversight and supervision, in response to recommendations of an international science planning organization  
- Identification of required engineering and technical development initiatives
- Assumption of responsibility for certain Ocean Drilling Program equipment and scientific assets including certain shipboard drilling equipment, scientific laboratory equipment, and curation, distribution of ODP cores, samples and data
- Science outreach and education to communicate IODP activities to the public, and to encourage awareness and interest in the scientific results of the program

Ship acquisition and refurbishment activities are expected to be completed by early CY 2005. Vessel operations and program support activities on a global basis are expected to begin in 2005. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor an announcement of solicitation.   Current plans include release of a formal, best value, competitive RFP during 2003, with award anticipated in late CY 2003, but this planning will be subject to the outcome of future NSF budget appropriations. The NSF is considering an acquisition strategy with the first stage resulting in award of the SIC contract, followed by government participation with the successful SIC in the reimbursable post-award selection, conversion planning and shipyard subcontracting process.  An initial contract performance period of five years, with an option for an additional five years, is anticipated.  

Potential interest and capabilities information is sought from potential sources to assess capabilities available within the marine and scientific communities, to refine the acquisition strategy and approach, and to further validate feasibility of the required drilling platform characteristics identified by the United States Science Advisory Committee.  Comments are requested within 45 days from date of publication of this RFI to allow sufficient time for consideration and inclusion, as appropriate, in the acquisition planning process. It is expected, when and if an RFP is released, that it would be synopsized and posted on the FedBizOpps web-site and on the NSF web-site as well. 

Written (and mailed) comments only should be addressed to the following:

<SUBJECT>Disposition of Excess Nickel
<DESC>This is a Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) from qualified companies who can transport, process and recycle approximately 15,700 tons of nickel scrap recovered from uranium enrichment process equipment into products suitable for use in support of government and commercial nuclear industry applications. Current inventories of nickel scrap consists of approximately 9,700 tons of nickel ingots stored at the DOE uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky, and approximately 3,600 tons of shredded nickel scrap stored at the DOE uranium enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. On-going demolition activities at the Oak Ridge facility will create an additional 2,400 tons of shredded nickel scrap. The scope of this EOI does not include an additional 21,000 tons of shredded nickel scrap that could become available from the future demolition of the shut down Oak Ridge and Portsmouth, Ohio, facilities and the operating Paducah facility. All of the nickel scrap is contaminated with uranium and trace quantities of technetium, neptunium, and plutonium. DOE Policy limits the recycle of this metal for use in products to support government and commercial nuclear industry applications. In addition, all of the shredded nickel scrap is considered classified confidential-restricted data. Qualified companies must possess current authorizations, licenses, personnel, and off-site facilities to accept, transport, store, process, and disposition classified, export controlled, and radioactively contaminated equipment and materials. In addition, firms must undergo a Foreign Ownership Control and Influence (FOCI) review in order to acquire personnel clearances necessary to work with the classified nickel scrap. Custodial responsibility for the material will pass to the contractor upon removal of the material from the DOE site. Title to the classified material will pass to the contractor upon elimination of all classification concerns. DOE is particularly interested in concepts that would result in beneficial impacts to local communities at Paducah, Portsmouth and Oak Ridge, in support of DOE efforts to diversify local economies. Please submit all expressions of interest no later than November 29, 2002. A prospective contractor's meeting is scheduled for December 5, 2002 for companies who have replied to this expression of interest. This meeting will include a short classified discussion open only to participants with a DOE "L" or "Q" clearance. Companies that wish to attend the presentation must provide the following information for up to three (3) representatives: Name social security number company name citizenship any DOE clearance (level, facility) DOE intends to compete this work among those firms who have Materials Disposition Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) with the DOE.

<SUBJECT>B -- Multi-Hazard Map Modernization Program
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide information regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) plans for updating and digitizing FEMA's flood map inventory.  This effort is in support of FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program Map Modernization Plan. Since 1968, nearly 90,000 map panels have been published for some 18,000 communities nationwide. The Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are used an estimated 30 million times by lenders, community officials, insurance agents, and all levels of government in land use and mitigation planning.  Over 75% of the FIRMs are at least 10 years old, 35% were issued more than 15 years ago, and many flood prone communities have never been mapped. Additionally, most of the flood map inventory was developed using antiquated manual cartographic techniques. Only a small percentage has relied on current digital and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology.  Historically, map development of this type has been done by the Architectural and Engineering profession under contracts awarded using the AE source selection process in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, commonly known as the Brooks Bill process. The introduction of GIS technology and the renewed emphasis on the use of performance based contracting makes it prudent to develop an acquisition strategy that includes evaluation of all acquisition methods including the Brooks Bill process, full and open competition, and the use of established Federal Supply or Government Wide Acquisition Contracts.  To this end, FEMA will conduct market research with a representative number of  contractors in various professions along with industry representatives and stakeholders to investigate current market best practices, limitations etc. in the program management, engineering, and technology areas. Upon completion of this market research, FEMA will develop an acquisition strategy to conduct the acquisition in the most efficient and effective manner.

<SUBJECT>--FSC 84 – Clothing, Individual Equipment & Insignia.  MARKET SURVEY for FCT-Body Armor Flotation Vest (BAFV)
<DESC>NA The U.S. Department of Defense, Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Natick Soldier Center is conducting market research for initial test and evaluation for vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies and methodologies in the design and fabrication of floatation body armor, that can be used in conjunction with or incorporated into the Special Operations Forces Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR), Body Armor/Load Carriage System (BALCS) Body Armor Subsystem.  Data gathered  during this market research for samples and technical data will aid in the development of a specification for the above BAFV, and will substantiate the need for specific requirements outlined therein. This is not a request for proposal and does not commit  the government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. Samples submitted will not be returned. Do not submit samples that have a cost, as it will not be reimbursed. The following is provided as a general statem ent of the requirement.  The Body Armor Floatation Vest must contain a positive buoyancy lift rate with floatation duration time for 250lbs at 24hrs minimum with an objective of 72hrs.  The system must be able to self-right a 250lb soldier as a minimum with an objective of 350lbs.   The weight of a medium size vests with BALCS hard armor plate is18.5lbs with an objective weight of 17.5lbs (floatation device included).  The weight requirement for a medium size vest without the BALCS hard armor plate is 8.5lbs minimum with an objectiv e weight of 7lbs (floatation device included).  It is our intent to have the flotation components integrated into the current  BALCS vest with the current soft and hard armor as part of the BAFV while still maintaining the functional configuration requirem ents such as the quick release and load carriage system configuration.  The objective is to have the floatation components incorporated into the BALCS vest and protected from ballistic penetration by the soft armor and the minimum threshold is to enhance t he BALCS vest by adding a flotation capability.  The soft armor for the BALCS vest/Collar provides NIJ IIIA and fragmentation protection equal to or greater than the Personnel Armor System Ground Troops (PASGT).  The flotation components should be capable of being re-armed and repacked by the user.  It must also have a dual option-arming mode that will enable the user to manually override the automatic employment of the floatation device to manual inflation.  The final configuration color of the vest is woo dland camouflage and three-color day desert.  Responses with data and samples are due on or before 03 January 2003, and must include a minimum of 1 sample of proposed BAFV for initial evaluation of the item’s performance capabilities, a product description with performance parameters, and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, production capability, and an estimated cost for the price of future test articles and production units.
