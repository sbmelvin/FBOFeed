<DESC>This is a Sole Source Solicitation for a Conference room needed for G8 summit for 13 days.  Time period: 31May04-12Jun04.  Conference room needed on Jekyll Island.  The conference room will be used as a multi-purpose center for staging, administration, armory and operations planning.  Sole Sourcing required because of the requirement for busses and vans to shuttle people to an offsite facility with the ongoing security constraints for the summitt.  With the facility being within walking distance aliviates that factor, plus the factor of both the CG lodging area and the armory being manned 24/7 for security purposes will reduce the amount of security personnel required.

<DESC>The Navy intends to procure system integrator services necessary to converge the four Navy Enterprise Resource Planning pilot projects (NEMAIS, SIGMA, SMART and CABRILLO) into one Navy enterprise design as a follow-on to current efforts.  The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be June 2004 through September 2004.  Efforts will include interoperability activities and lab services for integrating the pilot designs into a Navy standard template.  Functional processes include: financial management, program management, I-level maintenance, plant-level supply, wholesale supply, and human resource management.  The Navy intends to negotiate and award Delivery Order 0039 under Blanket Purchase Agreement N00421-00-A-0351 with BearingPoint LLC as the prime contractor and IBM Global Services-Federal and Electronic Data Systems (EDS), as major subcontractors for the ERP System Interoperability effort.  BearingPoint, IBM, and EDS as the current Navy Enterprise Resource Planning Pilot System Integrators are uniquely qualified to provide the required effort.  The incumbent system integrators have closely worked over the last 42 months with the Navy in bringing the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) SAP solution to the Navy customer base.  In that time they have gained expert knowledge in the Navy business processes and how those legacy business processes align to the SAP COTS industry best practices.  The current pilot integrators are the only companies with the background knowledge of the four Navy ERP pilots and the interoperability issues between them.  Only the BearingPoint/IBM/EDS team has the knowledge and experience to accomplish the ERP interoperability tasking in the timeframe required.  Note 22

<DESC>Architect-Engineer or Engineering Services are required for the preparation of Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI) for construction projects and major repair projects.  Examples of such projects include, but are not limited to:  Bachelor Quarters, Missile Magazines, Aircraft Maintenance Hangars, Medical Facilities, Pier Replacement, Administration Buildings, Religious Ministry Facilities, Physical Fitness Centers, hazardous Waste Storage, Child Development Centers, Weapons Laboratories, Weapons Schools, Fire Stations, Police Stations, and Academic Instruction Complexes.  Comprehensive multi-discipline capabilities in technical engineering and architectural services will be required to prepare the manuals based on design by others and from construction contractor submittals (e.g., product data, operation and maintenance data, shop drawings, basis of design, etc.).  The architect-engineer or engineering services required under this announcement may also require the preparation of Performance Work Statements (PWS), Quality Assurance Plans (QAP), cost estimates for Facility/Maintenance Support Contracts, Staffing Studies, and other studies related to the operation and maintenance of new and existing shore facilities.  The A&E firm may be required to deliver OMSI as data files (CADD, .pdf, etc.) as well as printed hard copies.  OMSI may require transfer of O&M information into Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMSS) such as ARCHIBUS, MAXIMO, PWTools, etc.  This data transfer may require manual entry, merging of databases, or use of extensible markup language (XML).  The A&E firm may be required to obtain, directly from the manufacturer, any missing operation and maintenance data which was not submitted by the construction contractor.  OMSI is a product developed by an A&E during the construction period to provide clear, comprehensive information on as-built systems to permit rapid and efficient takeover of the facility by Public Works forces or service contractors, and to assure economical and safe life cycle operation, maintenance and repair.  Principle OMSI elements are:  (a) Basis of Design and Design/Operational Concept Data; (b) Data needed for preparation of PWS, QAP and related Cost Estimates, as required for development of Facilities/maintenance Support Contracts (FSC); (c) Operating Procedures for Routine and Emergency Start-Up and Shutdown; and Emergency and Safety Instructions; (d) Operation and Maintenance Technical Data and As-built Product Documentation (Product Data, Shop Drawings, Test Data, etc.); (e) Maintenance Requirements, Test equipment, and Special Tools; (f) Preventive Maintenance Requirements and Schedules; (g) Troubleshooting Guides, Diagnostic Techniques, and Repair Procedures; (h) Supply Support (repair and spare parts, fuel lubricants, etc.); (i) Extended and Special Warranty Information; (j) Environmental Considerations; and (k) training Plans, Staffing Requirements and Personnel qualifications.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) have a requirement to purchase a Leica DM 6000 Microscope and an Interference Contrast from Vashaw Scientific Inc., 3125 Medlock Bridge Rd., Norcross, GA  30348.  This is an upgrade of existing automated, multi-color, time-resolved, 3-D imaging research microscope.  This type of imaging requires a series of many images to be acquired at extremely precise z-axis (focus) step distances under conditions of different wavelength illumination sometimes at different time points as well.  The following accessories and specifications shall be included in the system:  

•	Automated Fluorescence Excitation Manager – for automatic fluorochrome filter intensity matching and automatic illumination field masking for both the eyepieces and CCD cameras; also allows manual adjustment of red/green ratios of intensity.
•	8 position motorized fluorescence filter turret with “Zero Pixel Shift” fluorescence imaging in multicolor (a guaranteed performance specification from the manufacturer that, on changing filter sets, image registration points will not shift by more than 1.5m in the intermediate image plane with a 0.5x c-mount).
•	Electronic focus with finest z-step size of 15 nanometers to maximize z-axis sample number through a section of tissue.
•	Fully motorized condenser (turret, top cap, and polarizer) for auto-Köhler illumination from 1.25x to 100x.
•	Centerable phototube to compensate for eccentric CCD camera chips.
•	Motorized 7 position nosepiece with electronic parfocality and intelligent automation which helps prevent dry objectives from accidentally being rotated though immersion oil.
•	Fully automated Nomarski type differential interference contrast (including field and condenser aperture diaphragm adjustment, condenser Wollaston prism selection, objective Wollaston prisms selection, top cap adjustment, insertion of analyzer, insertion of polarizer, and restoration of shear values).  
•	Protected Wollaston prisms – prisms do not need to be removed or exposed to dust since they are permanently housed in closed turret housings.
•	Single button contrast control manager – extremely fast switching of contrast methods with foolproof automated settings permits users to perform error free switching of imaging techniques (D, BF, Pol, DIC, Fluor), even in darkened work areas.
•	Touch sensitive illuminated display screen for non-programmed functions and instrument status display permitted error free adjustments of operating conditions, even if not programmed into the automated settings of the microscope.
•	Automation override, so that it is possible to control any motorized module outside the parameters of its preassigned functions.
•	Automated Constant Color Intensity Control in all transmitted light imaging modes – provides extremely fast settings of color temperature regardless of voltage setting while also maintaining constant illumination intensity to the eyepieces or camera regardless of objective in use.
•	Absolute encoding of automated parts means that the computer and microscope communicate bidirectionally about the status of all electronic components.  Therefore, the microscope automation can be used without a computer, or the microscope’s components can be moved manually by hand, with the computer on or off, and neither the microscope nor computer will lose track of the position of components.
•	Nomarski Type Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) – the 6 prisms listed are required to permit this microscope to image in DIC mode.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of MatLab Control Design and Analysis Software license and maintenance support. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from The Mathworks as the only known source that can fulfill agency requirements.  Matlab Control Design and Analysis is the only known software that contains unique capability tools such as their tool analysis and synthesis, stateflow, nonlinear control toolbox, and C code generator for SIMULINK.  The renewal of this software maintenance support will allow continued technical support and upgrades.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet these requirements, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 11, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Heidenhain Corporation for the purchase of one (1) ROD 850 rotation measuring encoder, one (1) RON 806 rotation measuring encoder and, the necessary accessories to incorporate the equipment into NIST’s existing two axis high resolution rotation stage goniometer assembly.****** The requested Heidenhain ROD 850 and RON 806 will be mounted into an existing goniometer assembly. The current structure is designed with the inclusion of optical encoders of this dimension to be included.  The Heidenhain optical encoders use a proprietary 11 micro-A encoding signal which will interface with counter/interpolation controllers currently in operation in NIST’s laboratory allowing for cross calibration of goniometer assemblies. The "in-house" fabrication assembly design relies on the mounting of A ROD 850 for the first axis, and a RON 806 for the second rotation axis to meet our accuracy and mounting dimension requirements. Only the equipment available from Heidenhain can ensure 100% compatibility and interchangeability with the existing Heidenhain interpolation electronics. NIST currently has several Heidenhain interpolation electronics, AWE 1024 and IK 320, which take only 11 microA peak to peak signals. The IK 320 is a custom, R&D grade interpolator not available to retail clients acquired through prior collaboration on the high resolution system. It is NIST’s intention to use these high accuracy interpolators in system calibration with this new diffractometer assembly. ******Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 120 days after receipt of order.******The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.******No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 5, 2004.******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.***Any questions/concerning regarding this notice should be forwarded in writing via e-mail to the Purchasing Agent, Joni L. Laster @ joni.laster@nist.gov***

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The scope of U.S. and  foreign combat systems and weapons is comprised of the following family of  systems: individual infantry weapons, main battle tanks, light-armored infantry  combat vehicles, light-armored amphibious vehicles, armored personnel carriers,  armored cars, self-propelled guns and howitzers, towed guns and howitzers,  multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, recoilless guns, shoulder fired  rocket launchers, grenade launchers, ground to air anti-aircraft missile  launchers, and ground to ground missiles and rocket launchers.   The procedures  are intended for use by the U.S. Army EOD, Special Forces Units, and  potentially other U.S. Army units including engineers, and infantry/mechanized  units. Requirements:   The contractor shall prepare procedures that shall enable EOD  and non-EOD soldiers to achieve the following objectives: a.	identification of the combat vehicle/system/weapon. b.	Safe access to the interior of the vehicle/system to accomplish safe  shutdown, and safing operations for primary and secondary armaments. c.	Safing of the armaments and munitions on-board the combat  vehicle/system. d.

<RESPDATE>051404
<CONTACT>CHERIE SEE,937-257-4774 X 4411
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND MARKET RESEARCH FOR PLANNING PURPOSES				 1.  The Specialized Contracting Branch, ASC/PKWIE, Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base, OH is currently requesting information and conducting market research to  determine the best acquisition strategy through contract award for support of  the Consolidated Healthcare Asset Management Program (CHAMP) for Air Force  Material  Command Surgeon+s (AFMC/SG) office. 2. The CHAMP concept evolved from the AFMC Command Surgeon’s (AFMC/SG) need to  control costs and maintain its assets more effectively and efficiently.   Historically, AMFC/SG Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) and medical  equipment assets were maintained separately by a military and civil service  work force augmented by service contracts.   Because of changing force  structures and mission orientations, exclusive reliance an in-house workforce  was no longer economically feasible.  Recently, AFMC/SG assets were combined on  a medical equipment and RPIE assets management contract: The contractor  supplies a local program administrator and subcontracts out all maintenance.   The contractor charges a fixed annual amount for all preventative and  corrective maintenance coverage of selected assets; single point management and  provides historical maintenance data support. 3. In an effort to expand and improve CHAMP, our goal is to develop an  acquisition strategy that will result in a contractual vehicle that allows us  to achieve outstanding performance while significantly reducing our cost of  doing business with a manageable level of risk.  Key areas of interest include  the following:   ·	Contract Structure ·	Number of Contracts – single vs. multiple ·	Scope of each contract if more than one ·	Contract type(s) including incentives ·	Contract length ·	Cost reduction -- Enablers or constraints that affect: ·	Process management and improvement methodologies ·	Increasing workforce flexibility, efficiency, and agility ·	Opportunities for public/private partnerships ·	Teaming arrangements ·	Other areas that might shape our acquisition strategy 4.  Please provide responses to the above general areas, the specific questions  below and any other area(s) that you feel would assist in the development of an  acquisition strategy.   a.  How would you organize the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) across Air  Force Material Command (AFMC), in order to maximize the economies of scale and  to increase efficiencies? The locations currently under consideration for this  program are: ·	Brooks City Base, Texas ·	Edwards AFB, California ·	Eglin AFB, Florida ·	Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts ·	Hill AFB, Utah ·	Kirtland AFB, New Mexico ·	Robins AFB, Georgia ·	Tinker AFB, Oklahoma ·	Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio b.  Site visits and/or Industry Days are a normal part of the Request for  Proposal process.  If site visits are offered would you want to visit all  locations or a sample of a large and small facility? c.  Can your organization manage both medical equipment and Real Property  Installed Equipment (RPIE)? d.  What is the most effective means at your disposal to offer one-stop  management of our maintenance requirements: medical equipment and RPIE?  Our  requirements are: ·	Timeliness ·	Quality service/technical expertise ·	Reduced scheduled downtime ·	Cost reduction ·	Cost stability ·	Program flexibility ·	Management expertise ·	Repair documentation e.  Our research has revealed the most cost effective method of maintenance  involves strategic partnering.  What incentive programs can your company  propose to the government to partner with industry (i.e. cost sharing, rebates,  price reductions, etc.)? f.  The MTFs on this program range from 100-bed in-patient facilities to  business occupancy clinics.  Considering AFMC Command Surgeon (AFMC/SG) must,  with some confidence, be sure we are comparing apples to apples when cross- referencing ROE for the facilities.  What pricing strategies are best suited  for this program? g.  If you have a current medical equipment and/or RPIE contract, what pricing  strategy is used?  Would you be willing to provide a copy of your current  contract to include the Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement? h.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires us to use Performance Based  Service Acquisition (PBSA) and within that model the requirement exists for  contract incentives and penalties also exist.  What management strategies are  best suited to this program? 5.  This is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).   This is a request for information and market research and the Government will  not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation submitted  under this request. 6.  Interested parties are requested to provide information by 14 May 2004 to  ASC/PKWIE, Cherie See, to email address:  www.cherie.see@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT (TAMS 3):  Reference Sources Sought Notice posted 3 March 2004, the final acquisition strategy for the TAMS 3 acquisition has been determined.  The final acquisition strategy is to seek to award two contracts within the requirements of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710 (size standard is 1,000 people).  The plan is to award the first contract as a competitive 8(a) and the second to a Small Business [competed between SBs and remaining 8(a) offerors].  The contract type is cost-plus-award-fee with miscellaneous cost reimbursable line items such as travel and off-base facility.  These are Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) task ordering contracts with approximately 50 task orders being competed between the two contractors.  The combined effort of the two TAMS 3 contracts is approximately 300 man-years per year at the most probable quantity.  The Government intends to award two one-year basic contracts with four one-year options.  Projected contract award date is mid January 2005; however, the task ordering period of performance is 10 April 2005–9 April 2006.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be incrementally posted (starting approximately 3 May 04 or sooner) on FedBizOpps prior to the release of the formal RFP (tentatively scheduled to be released 10 June 2004).  
The Air Force Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB [AAC/AXR (PKZA)] will be holding a Pre-Solicitation Conference for prospective TAMS 3 offerors on May 13, 2004 from 0900-1200.  Conference location is Bob Hope Village, 30 Holly Ave., Shalimar FL 32579.  Check-in and registration will take place inside the Ballroom at 0830.  Each company is limited to three attendees.  Up to 2 additional company attendees will be allowed entry at 0855 on a space available basis.  All interested companies are invited to attend the conference and provide feedback on the TAMS 3 acquisition strategy/draft solicitation.  Request reply NLT 7 May 04, to AAC/AXR, Attn.:  Ms Mary Steinmetz and Ms Joanie Collins, Voice: 850-882-2925 or 882-2897, Fax: 850-882-3052, or Email:  mary.steinmetz@eglin.af.mil or joanie.collins@eglin.af.mil.  Replies should include:  name of company, name of attendees, title, telephone number and email.  Confirmation of receipt of email replies should include reference to TAMS 3 in subject line for identification purposes.  The Government will confirm receipt of email and fax replies within 2 working days of receipt; if confirmation not received, contact Mary Steinmetz or Joanie Collins.  Directions to the conference location will be posted separately on FedBizOpps.  Due to limited parking at the conference locations, attendees from each company are requested to carpool.  The attendee list for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and questions and answers will be posted on FedBizOpps for all interested parties.  Additionally, the Government has decided to not entertain one-on-one meetings in conjunction with the Pre-Solicitation Conference.  Instead of one-on-one meetings the Government has decided to continue receiving courtesy visits with companies until the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  Guidelines for courtesy visits are:  a) visits are limited to 30 minutes for the prospective offerors (teams are requested to attend together – more than 30 minutes may be approved if necessary) to present pertinent information to the Government; and b) the Government will not disclose any additional information about the solicitation other than what is posted on FedBizOpps.  
Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions relative to the TAMS 3 acquisition prior to release of the formal RFP.  All questions/comments thereafter must be submitted only to the Contracting Officer and may not receive a response.  All questions and answers will be posted on FedBizOpps and should be sent to both Mary Steinmetz and Joanie Collins via email.  In response to the sources sought synopsis posted 3 March 2004, a source list and amendments thereto have been posted on FedBizOpps.  The Government does not intend to post another source list.  Based on responses to a Request For Information posted 25 March 2004, in-person oral summaries or optional videos will not be a part of this acquisition.  Interested parties are encouraged to access future information on this acquisition via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms Mary Steinmetz, email mary.steinmetz@eglin.af.mil, telephone 850-882-2925, fax number 850-882-3052; and the Contracting Officer Ms Joanie Collins, email joanie.collins@eglin.af.mil, telephone 850-882-2897.  Collect calls will not be accepted.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This will be a two-phase solicitation process with Phase One being a total small business set-aside.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal in response to the Phase One solicitation.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The projects will be located in Alaska, primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about May 7, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

Interested parties will be evaluated as they are received to determine the following merit criteria; (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.

<CONTACT>John Rosamilia, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4220
<DESC>The U.S. Army ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806 is interested in acquiring market information on a 40mm Grenade Launcher Module (GLM).  This GLM should be capable of firing all current U.S. standard 40mm x 46mm low-velocity ammunition.  Additionally, it must accept more effective munitions with longer payloads/warheads, common to other NATO allies, but which are unable to be fired in the M203 system due to the constraint imposed by that weapon’s breach mechanism.  The GLM must mount on the M4 Modular Weapon System with a mounting architecture flexible enough for adaptation to future rifles/carbines.  The GLM should weigh less, be more reliable, more ergonomic, more accurate, and safer than the M203 Grenade Launcher.   Additionally it should be capable of mounting the AN/PSQ-18A Day/Night Sight (AN/PSQ-18A is manufactured by Insight Technology, Configuration – DNS-700-A9, Model 1800 black with tritium iron sights, NSN 1010 01516 0953).  Please notify the Government if the product being offered is a commercially available or a non-developmental item. Proprietary and/or classified information will be protected if requested with submission.  Interested firms should submit literature/brochures not exceeding twenty (20) pages describing their technical capabilities, item design details and operational characteristics, production capacity (monthly sustainable production rate, maximum production rate, and time frame for first and subsequent deliveries), location of manufacturing facilities, and unit production costs.  This information may be mailed by May 24, 2004 to U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Attn: AMSTA-AQ-APD, Bldg 10, John Rosamilia, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future development efforts. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.

of federal small business programs, including small business size status and affiliation issues, 8(a) Business Development
program rules, HUBZone program,  and changes to the Veteran owned small business programs.  We will also discuss the
new and changing regulations in these areas including SBA's proposed conversion of 37 of its revenue or "annual receipts"
based size standards to 10 "employee" based standards.  This proposed conversion of the size standards could have a
significant impact on certain businesses that, although currently eligible as small, may not qualify as small under the new
regulations! Cost is $45.00.  To register visit the PTAP web site at http://www.gmu.edu/gmu/ptap/ or call 703-277-7757.

<SUBJECT>R--Investment Advisor
<DESC>The United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) solicits your qualifications for providing investment advice and consultation services for a Trust Fund for the People of the Federated States of Micronesia and a Trust Fund for the People of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. BACKGROUND Public Law 108-188 authorizes the creation of the two trust funds.  Over the twenty years through 2023, Government of the United States will contribute $442 million to the trust fund for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and $235 million to the trust fund for the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI).  The RMI will contribute $25 million as soon as its trust fund is established and $2.5 million in each of the two subsequent years; the FSM will contribute $30 million by the end of this fiscal year (before October 1, 2004).  Income will accumulate through the end of 2023.  It is anticipated that $46 million will be available in fiscal year 2004 for the FSM trust fund, and $32 million for the RMI trust fund.  After 2023, the income will aid in supporting the governmental activities of the FSM and the RMI.  These activities are described in section 211 of the Compact of Free Association, as amended, relating to the FSM and section 211 of the Compact of Free Association, as  amended relating to the RMI.

<SUBJECT>20 -- Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) - Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel involved in advancing the capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles in Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) applications.  This event will be held on 26 May 2004 at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC (701 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20004).  The yellow and green Metro lines serve the Navy Memorial.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for the future procurement of un-tethered, unmanned, underwater Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems that will support the Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) mission in the Shallow Water (SW) and deeper water zones (40 – 600 feet sea water (FSW)).  Unmanned vehicles have the potential of addressing the two key, overarching MCM measures of effectiveness (MOE), which are to: 1) Reduce the overall MCM tactical timeline; and 2) Reduce the overall risk to MCM forces.  UUVs have the potential to systematically reconnoiter predetermined geographic areas (nominally 5NM X 5NM) and precisely mapping the bottom contour while providing information to assist in the classification of objects that exhibit mine-like characteristics.  Additionally, unmanned vehicles equipped with high-resolution sensors can be used to reacquire and identify previously mapped targets of interest.  The SMCM UUVs must be deployable from MHC/MCM platform(s) with existing shipboard equipment.  The vehicles will need to possess mobile ingress/egress capabilities to enable them to move from a launch point of up to nominal ranges at 5 NM or greater.  Data recorded by the vehicle must be transferable to compatible Navy tactical displays and information systems (i.e. GCCS/MEDAL (Minewarfare Environmental Data and Aides Library)) to facilitate the re-acquisition of targets during subsequent missions by USN Mine Warfare assets.  Currently, the U.S. Navy is exploring SMCM UUV concepts, as demonstrated through the extensive leadership and efforts of the Office of Naval Research in this area of technology. Current efforts include the use of existing hardware to gain fleet feedback and to assist in refining requests for initiation of an acquisition program in FY06.  Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate the development of a future competitive solicitation.  Similar to the early involvement of industry in the acquisition effort, early Fleet involvement is also being pursued. Two limited-scope demonstration events were conducted during 2003.  The results of these demonstrations reinforced the value of UUV systems in supporting the SMCM mission and a summary of the results of these demonstrations will occur at the Industry Day.  Multiple limited scope evaluations are currently being pursued by NSWC-PC (Solicitation N61331-04-R-0014).  These evaluations will begin in FY04 and will be completed in FY05.  A full-scale acquisition is expected to start in FY06.    

A notional Acquisition Strategy for fielding a first generation SMCM deployed UUV system will also be briefed.  Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Attendance at the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, Address, Telephone Number, and e-mail address not later than 17 May 2004.  Registration data must be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC identified below.  Approximately one month prior to the SMCM UUV Industry Day, read ahead documents will be available electronically from the Technical POC for any interested contractor.  Registered attendees will be sent this read ahead information by e-mail when available.  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop or the read-ahead documentation may be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC so that they can be addressed at Industry Day.  The purpose of this Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved.

All services shall be performed at the U.S. Coast Guard YARD on or around ships in dry-dock, at dockside, or in Coast Guard YARD Industrial shops.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Structural Workers be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.    Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior structural services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting award.    The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker must have a thorough knowledge of marine blueprint reading and lay outs, some knowledge of mechanical drawing, a thorough knowledge of the practices, processes, and materials of the trade, a good working knowledge of allied trades, a thorough knowledge of shop mathematics, and knowledge of ship building nomenclature  and abbreviations.  Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must have knowledge of the various metal forming machines required in fabricating ship structures and SMAW (Shield Metal Arc Welding), GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding), and the electrical welding circuit. Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must be able to pass and maintain welding certification to procedures qualified to work he is assigned. In addition, Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must possess a high degree of accuracy, skill, and aptitude in development of the work and be able to keep pace with technological developments in the trade.  Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum three (3) qualified Marine Structural Workers and a Lead Marine Structural Worker within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – STRUCTURAL WORKER and CLIN 0002 - LEAD STRUCTURAL WORKER.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours, inclusive of overtime, (1,200 hrs/Structural Workers, 180 hours Lead Structural Workers) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Structural Workers is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Structural.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.   On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Structural Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Structural Workers and 30 for the Lead Structural Worker.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Marine Machinery Mechanics be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.    Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting award.    The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic must have a careful knowledge of marine equipment assembly, installation, maintenance, repair, and adjustment.

Marine Machinery Mechanics and Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic shall have the ability to do journeyman level work without more than normal supervision.  Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum three (3) qualified Marine Machinery Mechanics and a Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – MARINE MACHINERY MECHANIC and CLIN 0002 - LEAD MARINE MACHINERY MECHANIC.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours (1,200 hrs/Marine Machinery Mechanics, 180 hours Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Marine Machinery Mechanics is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.

If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Machinery Mechanics are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Marine Machinery Mechanics and 30 for the Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

<DESC>PEACE CORPS Overseas Hardware Refresh Project International Technical Support Division PC CIO/OI/ITS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW): I. Overview: Peace Corps’ Office of the Chief Information Officer, Operations and Infrastructure team, International Technical Support division (PC CIO/OI/ITS), invites offers from authorized Hewlett Packard resellers under GSA IT schedule 70 (standard item 132-8) to provide on a delivered basis servers and workstations to approximately seventy (70) locations worldwide as part of the agency’s phased upgrade of overseas Post computer infrastructure. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(4), the PC CIO has determined that it continues to be in the Government’s best interest to maintain a uniform and standard operating environment based on Hewlett Packard (Compaq) equipment. Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS will order each shipment for equipment separately based on the overseas delivery location. Each order will be sent to one overseas location and the average order will include approximately 32 desktops, six (7) laptops, one docking station, and one (1) server. Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS intends to purchase a minimum of 2000 workstations and 70 servers over the next three fiscal years, subject to availability of funds (FAR 52.217-9: resulting contract will be one year Base Period with up to two (2) one year Option Periods). Vendors will be required to offer volume discounts off of their GSA schedule 70 132-8 prices. II. Review Period: Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS requires an initial review period after the first six (6) orders have been delivered. During the review period, PC CIO/OI/ITS will review vendor performance based on the following criteria: 1) Timeliness and accuracy of deliveries of equipment to overseas locations; 2) Quality (ruggedness, survivability) of packing materials; 3) Condition of equipment at time of delivery; 4) Availability of order status information; 5) Accuracy and timeliness of reporting; 6) Quality of overall customer support; 7) Price and billing accuracy: 8)Timeliness of repair and replacement. Based on the initial review, PC CIO/OI/ITS will determine if further performance is administratively burdensome and whether a no cost settlement (termination for convenience) is warranted and performance by another vendor is in the Government’s best interest. Periodic reviews are also contemplated during the life of this project (see Appendix A). III. Delivery Schedule: Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS will provide the vendor with the information below for each order: 1) Country and City of Delivery; 2) Date of Delivery (this is the latest date that the product can be received in country); 3) Number of workstations, laptops, and docking stations; 4) Post Point of Contact name and phone number; 5) Voltage settings. The entire equipment order should arrive no later than FOUR (4) weeks (28 calendar days) from the order date at its designated delivery location (see section XV for delivery incentive and 5 day delivery window). The vendor will be able to process multiple, simultaneous orders to accommodate all the orders in a given quarter (Appendix A). IV. Deliverables: With each order, the vendor will acquire on behalf of Peace Corps the required hardware based on the specifications below for workstations, laptops, docking stations, and servers. The vendor will also affix Peace Corps provided asset tags to each piece of equipment (including workstations, servers, docking stations, monitors, UPSs, and surge suppressors). Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS will review and may revise hardware requirements annually or in the case of discontinued products. All workstations and laptops for a given order will be the same model. The vendor will notify PC CIO/OI/ITS a minimum of 90 days ahead of any product hanges.  The vendor will also provide a sample of test equipment 60 days ahead of any workstation, laptop, or server model change. The vendor will provide a Bill of Materials via email to CIO/OI/ITS for each model of equipment for each order one week before delivery. This Bill of Materials will include part numbers for all major system components as well as PCI cards. Peace Corps requires equipment models that are domestically available. At the current time, PC CIO/OI/ITS knows of no prohibitions, including those related to 128-bit encryption, against the export of the required equipment. Vendors are encouraged to provide any and all export control regulations which may apply to the equipment detailed herein.

Upon request, the vendor will send via express mail either the original or a certified copy of the commercial invoice to a specific country to assist with their customs processing. This request will typically be made 3 weeks ahead of the delivery date. Comprehensive flight and ground transport information for each shipment (including flight numbers and schedules as well transit points) will be delivered to Peace Corps HQ via email at the latest, the same day that the equipment has been shipped from the US. Any changes in flight status will be reported to Peace Corps via phone and email no later than 4 hours after the change has taken place. For payment purposes, the vendor will also provide a copy of the Bill of Lading, commercial invoice, and asset list (including serial numbers, bar coded asset numbers, and models) to the Headquarters office one week before the required delivery date. The vendor will ensure that all items are preserved, packaged, packed, and marked in accordance with best commercial practices to meet the packing requirements of the carrier and to ensure safe and timely delivery at the intended destination. VII. Proof of Delivery: Vendor and agency will determine a mutually agreed upon location to inspect goods on arrival in country to determine if there has been any loss or damage to the shipment.  This determination will occur no later than one week before the shipping date. Only upon successful audit of all inventory will the agency accept the order. Any discrepancies in the order will be the vendor’s responsibility. Any missing or damaged equipment will be replaced (replacement equipment will arrive in the country) at the vendor’s cost in no more than ten calendar days after the inspection. VIII. Reporting Requirements: For each order, the vendor will provide a report in Excel Format (electronic) no later than one week after the shipment date.

Workstation model and specifications Server and specifications Laptop and specifications Warranty beginning and end dates for all components Country Address equipment shipped to Any customs instructions provided by CIO/OI/ITS Serial Number
Peace Corps Property Number; 2) For other equipment (Monitors, UPS, surge suppressor, etc.): Model Serial Number Peace Corps Property Number. The reporting requirements may change over the course of the contract term. Cumulative reports of equipment purchased, equipment type, purchase date, etc. will available through an online tool. IX. Meeting and Weekly Status Requirements: The vendor will give the agency’s COTR a weekly update report via conference call including a detailed email of all current issues or inabilities to meet deliverables, upcoming issues, and current order statuses. The vendor will also be available for monthly or quarterly meetings with both the COTR, office of contracts, Chief of International Technical Support (ITS), and the CAO. X. Order and Shipment status: All order statuses, invoices, and shipping updates will be available to the agency through a web-based interface. XI. Warranty Status:
All warranty information tied to equipment ordered will also be tracked and available online. Vendor will identify and notify the applicable local service center to insure that international warranties will be honored. Vendor will provide this written acknowledgement to Peace Corps within two (2) weeks (14 calendar days) after equipment delivery. XII. Invoicing Requirements: 
Peace Corps will not consider for payment any invoices submitted after 90 days from the date of delivery. XIII. Project Management: Peace Corps requires a single point-of-contact (SPOC) for all ordering and shipping information. The SPOC would act as the shipper of record; responsible for validating the accuracy of order information with Peace Corps personnel, as well as ensuring the timely delivery of all items by coordinating all freight and custody transfer arrangements via third party agents with Peace Corps HQ and Post staff. The SPOC will make any necessary contingency plans and work with the shipper to change flights as necessary to guarantee the timely shipment arrival. The SPOC will keep Peace Corps CIO/OI/ITS abreast of all shipping costs on all upcoming orders. For any shipping costs exceeding $12,000, the vendor will not proceed with shipment until written approval is given via email from Peace Corps. XIV. Service Level Agreement: Peace Corps reserves the right to modify delivery terms on a case-by-case basis, in response to unique situations or if unacceptable losses (defined herein as greater than ten percent (>-10%) of the gross item count) are encountered at a particular destination, back-to-back deliveries, or over a one quarter (90-days or three month) period. XV. Incentive Clause: The Government contemplates award of a firm, fixed price (FFP) order (with subsequent modifications for successive deliveries) under an existing GSA schedule 70 contract for hardware and delivery services. The vendor will be allowed a 5 business day delivery window beginning from the date of delivery indicated on the order.  Vendor will be assessed a 10% deliverable credit payable to the Peace Corps if this 5 day window is missed in delivering the complete order (no missing equipment). Missing equipment shall be defined as any equipment discrepancy between the most current order and the equipment accepted by the PC staff in the receiving country. Equipment lost or stolen en route is subject to the terms outlined in section VII. E.g. The order for Uzbekistan is placed on Mar. 1, 2004. The delivery date is indicated as Mar. 29, 2004. The vendor has from Mar. 30 to Apr. 5 to deliver the product without incurring a deliverable credit. 
Reward for consistent, complete, and on-schedule delivery of items ordered for 10 consecutive orders (following the last missed order) will result in an Earnback of all deliverable credits. E.g. Tanzania order is late by 7 business days. A deliverable credit is assessed. Kenya and Uganda orders are on time. Half the East Timor order arrives on time and the second half arrives 6 business days late. A second deliverable credit is assessed. The 10 consecutive order count begins after the East Timor order. All hardware will be purchased on a firm, fixed price basis (FFP). On-schedule delivery shall be defined as when the PC Post staff formally accepts delivery of the equipment by the last agreed upon scheduled delivery date. XVI. Evaluation & Offer Instructions: The Basis for Award will be Best Value to the Government; wherein, Technical Service Capability is equal to or more important than Cost. As evidence of their Technical Service Capability, vendors will be required to submit at least three (3) Past Performance references, detailing services of similar scope and term delivered to Federal or other business clients worldwide. There will no limit to the length of these references and they will not count against a 50 page maximum Technical Proposal limit. The Technical Proposal will also have a supporting Cost Proposal, detailing all direct and indirect costs (ODCS). All ODC categories will be defined by other than “Miscellaneous”. There will be no limit to the length of the Cost Proposals. Award will be made to a single vendor. FAR 52.215-1 Alt I will apply, in that the Government may award without discussions to offerors within the competitive range (see FAR 15.306(c)). FAR 15.102 oral presentations may be required and will be at the sole descretion of the Govt (Peace Corps). Offerors are encouraged to submit formal questions in writing regarding this procurement to the Contracting Officer by no later than Noon (12pm) local Washington DC time on Monday, May 3, 2004. Questions will be considered for technical review and a formal answer will be provided via www.fedbizopps.gov prior to submission of proposals. Three hard copies of each proposal, along with an electronic copy in Microsoft Excel and Word 2000 compatible and/or compressed file (.zip) or image (Adobe Acrobat .pdf) formats, will be submitted.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity of Defense Intelligence Agency has a requirement to procure 12 personnel for a period of approximately four months to perform a wall-to-wall inventory and apply passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to Government property in the three facilities located in the National Capital Region.  In conjunction with the inventory each item of Government property which is classified as either durable or non-expendable will be tagged with a Government provided RFID tag.  The vendor’s personnel will examine each item of property and enter the appropriate Unique Item Identifier (UII) into a laptop computer provided by the Government which contain the information on the item of property and encode a RFID tag with UII, serial number and other pertinent data identifying the property, owner, and location of the property.  When property is discovered which is not located on the inventory, action will be taken by the accompanying the Government representative to perform a “Found on Base (FOB) action and add the item to the Government inventory.  Following the addition of the item to the inventory an appropriate RFID tag will be produced and placed on the item.  The owning organization will accept responsibility for the property during the FOB from the Government personnel.  If the property is not going to be retained by the organization, an FOB will be created for turn-in and the property will be expeditiously removed to the warehouse.  All required material to support the RFID tagging will be provided by the Government.  Top Secret cleared personnel are preferred but not required.  This is a short term requirement and is not expected to generate any other logistical requirements.  Evaluation will be made based on:  (1) Experience Performing Physical Inventories/Past Performance 25%; (2) Understanding of the Requirement 25%; (3) Approach towards meeting the Government Requirement 15%; (4) Manning to support the requirement 15%; and (5) Cost 20%.  All interested parties may submit offers to fax (202) 231-8575 or mail to DIA, ATTN: DAL2A, Cheong Chon, Bldg 6000, Bolling AFB, Washington,  D.C.  20340-5100.
