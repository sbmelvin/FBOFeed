<DESC>THE RESPONSE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WAS EXTENDED FROM MAY 15, 2003 TO SEPTEMBER 15, 2003.  WE ARE REPOSTING THE NOTICE.  THE RFP IS STILL AVAILABLE ON THE NIAID/CMB HOMEPAGE AT http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health. As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38). The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies. The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees. See Government-wide Numbered Note 1. As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites. It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas. The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases. The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately May 17, 2004. RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 13, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

Section C – Statement of Work 

The Government submits this Statement of Work as a Performance Based Service Contract Work Statement for Graphic Design and Editing Services.

C.1 	BACKGROUND, INTENTION and PURPOSE. 

Statement of Work

General Information

Introduction

The Department of Commerce (DoC) Office of Budget (OB) produces three key documents for distribution of budget and planning information to Congress, other Federal agencies, and the private sector:  the strategic plan, the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) and the Budget in Brief (BIB).  Each of these documents require outside assistance in the form of design, layout/production and editing.  This statement of work is for the design, layout , production and editing of two of these documents, the strategic plan and the PAR.

Background

Strategic Plan

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) mandates that each Federal agency develop a Strategic Plan.    

OB works with representatives of each Departmental bureau to provide the text, tables and potential graphics for this document.   OB works with the bureaus to ensure that each bureau provides an accurate depiction of the bureau’s activities and contributions in the context of the broader Departmental mission and its corresponding strategic goals and objectives.  Using a Microsoft platform, OB initially distributes Microsoft Word based templates and distributes them to bureau staff.  Bureau staff verify and provide text.  OB staff then reviews this information and then with the bureau staff resolves any textual problems that may result from Secretarial guidance or other sources.  The end result is a draft strategic plan that is further refined after comments are received from the Office of Management and Budget and other stakeholders.  

After all comments are received the Strategic Plan is sent to Congress in September.       

FY 2003 Performance and Accountability Report (PAR)

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires that each agency report on its performance and financial management through the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).  This report is due to OMB and Congress in January, 2004 (though Commerce intends to complete it by December, 2003) and in November each year after that.    

For the PAR, OB works with representatives of each Departmental bureau and the Office of Financial Management (OFM) and the Office of Management and Organization (OMO) to provide the text, tables and potential graphics for these documents.   OB works with the bureaus to ensure that each bureau provides an accurate depiction of the bureau’s activities particularly with regard to the performance of the bureau.  Using a Microsoft platform, OB initially distributes Microsoft Word based templates and distributes them to bureau staff.  Bureau staff enters text and numerical data.  OB staff then reviews this information and then with the bureau staff resolves any numerical or textual problems that may result from Secretarial guidance or other sources.  The end result is a completed chapter for each bureau that OB staff then combines along with summary DoC information (including appendices) into a final DoC document.  OB then combines this section with a financial management section prepared by the Office of Financial Management (OFM) and a management discussion and analysis section prepared by the Office of Management and Organization (OMO).

Scope

Since the goal of these projects is the production of a highly polished, strong depiction of Departmental plans and programs, it is the role of OB staff to work with the bureaus on the content of the documents.  Current staff resources do not allow for adequate work in the areas of design and production.  Thus, the overall purpose of this task is to provide design, layout / production and editing services for this document.  In determining this contract, the contractor shall provide separate estimates for each of the parts of this task as specified in the Work Requirements section of this statement of work.

Applicable Documents

Applicable documents for this task include:
The FY 2000-2005 Strategic Plan which is available electronically at http://www.osec.doc.gov/bmi/budget/StrategicPlan.pdf
The FY 2002 Performance and Accountability Report which is available electronically at http://www.osec.doc.gov/bmi/budget/02commercereport.htm 

Any potential contractors can view these documents for an idea of how the finalized product should appear.

Work Requirements

Technical Requirements

The contract involves the following tasks:

Initial Meetings / Communications

The contractor shall initially meet with OB staff to coordinate an exact work / production process including interim and final production dates.  This meeting will include members from the Departmental printing staff to ensure that the final product produced by the contractor can work with any printing contractors.  Once OB staff has awarded the printing contract, OB will provide the name of that contractor to this editing / design contractor.  The editing contractor will work with the printing contractor, making sure that OB staff are involved in any communications that they may have.  Throughout the course of the work the contractor shall meet with OB staff on an as needed basis.  The contractor shall arrange for or provide the necessary means to transport any materials whether electronically or in hard copy format.  In the initial meeting, OB staff will discuss basic formats, e.g., margin size, so as to facilitate layout design later in the process.  
     
Initial Design

OB staff will provide the contractor with past document showing previous cover and format designs, along with at least two cover ideas for the current documents.  These cover ideas can be broad in scope rather than detailed.  Based on past designs and contractor ideas, the contractor shall present no less than three new designs to OB staff.  Cover designs for the documents should be similar enough to indicate that it is similar to the prior documents, yet still have distinct differences, other than simply having the title different.  An example may different shading of colors for the two documents or slightly different cover pictures.  

Cover designs must be in a four-color format.  OB staff will provide the necessary text that would appear on each cover.  Interior design would be in a black and white format.  Interior design may include photographs, however, the contractor must specify what the cost would be with and without photographs.

If the initial cover designs are unacceptable, the contractor shall provide three additional choices within one week.

Layout / Production

OB will provide an initial draft of the document to the contractor, including any pictures OB may want to incorporate into the final product.  At this time, OB initially estimates that each document would have the following specifications: up to 1200 pages, 100 tables and 50 pictures.

The contractor shall then provide OB an initial layout and format design to be approved by OB along with estimates for these task based on the page estimates stated as well as estimates for page lengths being either greater or lesser.  

The contractor shall provide a design in 1 color format in a program that is easily translatable to printers and that the Office of Budget could have access to, e.g., Quark or Pagemaker.    

Scanning / Design

It may be necessary for the contractor to scan pictures into the design.  The contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost per picture to be scanned into the document as well as the specific format that the picture that would be required from OB.  

The contractor may provide suggestions as to pictures that it has and could insert into the design.  If so, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of those pictures to OB.  Upon approval of the cost, the contractor would then incorporate those pictures into the layout.

Alterations / Corrections

Once OB has provided a final version of each document to the contractor, the contractor shall edit / proofread all text, tables and graphics.  In its response to this statement of work, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of each round of edits for each of these documents.  The following items should not be edited:

·	Mission statements,
·	Corresponding DoC Strategic Goal statement,
·	Appendix showing alphabetical list of acronyms

As part of this alteration phase, the contractor should be prepared to make final minor textual and numerical changes to both text and tables. 

Text / graphic editing (required)

Once OB has provided a final version of each document to the contractor, the contractor shall edit / proofread all text, tables and graphics.  In its response to this statement of work, the contractor shall provide an estimate as to the cost of each round of edits for each of these documents.  Nothing in the documents should be edited without the prior consent of the OB.

As part of this alteration phase, the contractor should be prepared to make final minor textual and numerical changes to both text and tables. 
  
Copy editing (optional at this point depending on cost)

The contractor shall provide copy editing estimates of each document including the amount per round.  Copy editing includes, but is not limited to, editing the content for readability and context.  Since each document has several different authors (and thus different writing styles), copy editing also includes modifying the text so that the entire document would have a uniform style.  

If OB decides to include copy editing as part of the contract, OB will provide a draft of each document at least three weeks prior to the final due date so that the contractor can proceed with initial editing.    

Website design / construction of files (optional)

The contractor shall provide an initial estimate for converting each document to: 1) a simple, web-based PDF format and, 2) a website that would meet minimum accessibility requirements of Section 508 EITAS 1194.22 to include screen reader capability.
