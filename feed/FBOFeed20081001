Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to privatize the water distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 914th Airlift Wing (AW) of the Air Force Reserve and the 107th Airlift Wing (AW) of the New York Air National Guard.  The 914th AW is the host unit at the Niagara Falls ARS and the 107th AW is the largest tenant.  The installation is located approximately 6 miles east of Niagara Falls, New York and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York.  The installation occupies 985 acres on the north side part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York.  The installation leases 38.71 acres from the People of the State of New York and 37.1 acres from the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority.    
The 914th AW has an economic impact of over $91 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 1,245 military and 501 civilian personnel.  The 914th AW’s mission is to provide airland and aerial delivery of troops, supplies, and equipment using C-130 H-3 Hercules cargo aircraft carriers.  The base occupies 82 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 62 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 20 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW has an economic impact of over $49 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 585 military personnel, and 215 civilians.  The 107th occupies 22 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 16 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 6 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW’s mission recently changed to become directly connected to that of the 914th.  The 107th now works alongside the Air Force Reserve's 914th Airlift Wing as part of the Air Force Reserve's "Associate" concept. In an associate base, units share people, resources and processes to accomplish their flying missions. "Team Niagara" features the 914th as host to the 107th with both units flying reserve C-130 H2s.  
The Niagara Falls International Airport opened in 1928 and was joined by the military in 1946.  The base has expanded several times over the years.  The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.   A 25,000-square foot expansion on the Armed Forces Reserve Center (AFRC) is currently under construction.

The Niagara Falls ARS water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, exterior backflow devices, pumps, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:
•	Water Pump Building 729
•	Multi-Use Building 891 
•	Fire Protection Mains – water mains exiting building 828
•	Fire Protection Water Reservoir – located in building 828
•	Fire Pump Building 828
•	Post Indicator Valves

	The Niagara Falls ARS receives water from the City of Niagara Falls, the Town of Wheatfield, and the Town of Niagara.  The main water supply, provided by the City of Niagara Falls, enters the installation at the southeast corner through a 10-inch diameter asbestos cement pipe.  It passes through a City of Niagara Falls owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in Building 729 before entering the installation’s distribution system.  Ownership of the distribution system starts at the demand side of the master meter.  Building 729 will be retained by the Installation after privatization but access will be granted to the new owner.  
	The secondary water supply, provided by the Town of Wheatfield, enters the installation through an automatic pressure sensitive valve near the main gate on Lockport Road. The valve automatically opens when the pressure in the installation’s distribution system drops below 50 psig.  The water line passes through an installation owned meter and backflow preventers in Building 891 before entering the distribution system.  Ownership of the Town of Wheatfield line begins at the connection to the water main in Lockport Road.  Building 891 will remain property of the Air Force, but access will be provided to the new owner. 
	The third water supply, provided by the Town of Niagara, enters the Fire Training Area through a 6-inch pipe that connects to the Town of Niagara Main on Lockport Road.  Ownership of the water line from the Town of Niagara to the Fire Training Area begins at the property line.  The line passes through a Town of Niagara owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in the metering pit.  The Fire Training Area is independent of the Niagara Falls ARS’ distribution system and fire protection system. 
	The Niagara Falls ARS’ water distribution pipes consist  of copper, ductile iron, cast iron, steel, PVC, and asbestos cement on the 914th AW’s side and PVC, with smaller amounts of cast iron and transite on the 107th AW’s side.  Expansions and repairs to the 914th AW’s system have replaced part of the original pipes with PVC and ductile iron. Tracer wire was installed with the PVC pipe at the 107th AW.  The estimated range of pipe depth at the installation is 4 to 8 feet below the ground surface but actual depth may vary and approximately 5 percent of the pipes are assumed to pass under pavement.  The secondary water meters will be included in the privatization contract, including those located inside buildings.  The buildings will remain Air Force property but access will be granted to the meter locations.
	The original pipe appears to be in good condition from the perspective that it is not clogging or corroding. However, the pipe beneath the 914th AW has reachedthe end of its useful life. Plans for replacing the water distribution mains on the 914th AW are completed, but a contract to complete the project has not been awarded.  
Niagara Falls ARS acquires potable water from the City of Niagara Falls. The Town of Wheatfield provides emergency water service to the water system if the pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level.
The FY 2007 annual water consumption was 32,325kgal.  The average monthly usage was 2,694kgal. The peak monthly demand recorded in this period was 3,400kgal per month (over a 3-month period). The minimum monthly demand was 2,164kgal per month (over a 3-month period).
The city of Niagara Falls provides more than 95 percent of the water used on base. The quantity of water supplied by the Town of Wheatfield varies from one year to the next depending upon the number of times the pressure drops within the main system. 


	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - PACAF</span></strong>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from interested industry sources to aid the U.S. Government in the development of the contracting strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for in-theater depot maintenance services. This requirement will support United States Air Force A-10C aircraft stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</span> The information requested is for planning purposes only and DOES NOT COMMIT the U.S. Government to provide compensation for information requested nor does it commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This notice does not provide any direction nor does it change any contractual obligations to sources currently under contract with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />The A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the Warthog, is a highly maneuverable, low-altitude, close air support aircraft built around a 30mm seven-barrel Gatling gun and powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans. The aircraft is designed for combat survivability and can employ a variety of free-fall and precision guided munitions as well as a full compliment of self-protection chaff and flares. The first production Fairchild Republic A-10A was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in October 1975 and achieved Initial Operating Capability in 1977. In 2006, the USAF began modifying A-10A aircraft with the Precision Engagement (PE) modification which adds upgraded cockpit displays, digital stores management, advanced targeting pod integration, and other improvements. Precision engagement modified aircraft are designated as the A-10C.</p>
<p><br />The A-10C has surpassed its original design life but has been tasked to remain in service with the USAF until at least 2028. However, as result of the 30+ years of operational service, the aircraft is yielding to the effects of fatigue and corrosion. To extend the life of the aircraft, the USAF has implemented depot-level maintenance inspection/repair programs for the wing, fuselage, nacelle, and other fatigue-critical components. These inspection/repair programs are designated as the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and Scheduled Structure Inspection (SSI). SLEP is a once-per aircraft procedure that began in Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) and is scheduled to be completed on all aircraft by Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13). Once an aircraft has undergone SLEP, an SSI will be accomplished every 2000 flying hours or 1600 landings, or 8 years (whichever comes first) until the end of its service life.</p>
<p><br />Since 1993, the United States Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) has operated a squadron of approximately 27 A/OA-10 aircraft. These aircraft are operated, maintained, and employed by the 51st Fighter Wing, Osan Air Base, Republic of South Korea. To reduce the costs and issues associated with ferrying aircraft from Osan AB to the Continental United States for depot level maintenance, PACAF requested the establishment of a contractor depot facility within the Korean theater. In 2001, the A/OA-10 System Program Office (SPO) awarded a contract through fair and open competition to establish an in-theater depot facility to support PACAF A-10 aircraft. The period of performance on the existing depot-services contract is nearing conclusion. As required by U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, the A/OA-10 SPO is pursuing a follow-on competition to select a contractor to perform the requested in-theater depot services beginning in FY10.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><br />The A/OA-10 System Program Office is seeking interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance support for the 27 PACAF A-10C aircraft. Depot-level maintenance is defined as that materiel maintenance requiring major overhaul or a complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond the responsibility or capability of lower levels of maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The specific work requirements to be accomplished on this proposed contract order are outlined in the attached PWS. This PWS is still in draft form and is subject to change. Please note that the work requirements in the work specification attachments for aircraft paint, SLEP and SSI have been removed from the PWS for the purpose of this RFI. These attachments will contain the specific inspection criteria and additional work requirements for these services. Please direct any questions related to the work requirements for these efforts to the Contracting Representative listed in this RFI.</p>
<p><br />The U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Installation of the Precision Engagement modification for all 27 aircraft is currently forecasted to be accomplished over the first two years of the contract period (FY10-11). In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of Osan AB, Republic of South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>INSRUCTIONS FOR INTERESTED SOURCES</strong></p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is an invitation for all interested and qualified sources to review the draft PWS and provide the USAF A-10 Program Office feedback and other information to be considered for planning purposes. In addition, you may ask questions regarding this requirement which will be answered by the USAF A-10 System Program Office (SPO) and posted as updates to this notice. All responses should be submitted to the U.S. Government Contracting representative listed below. <br />Please review the draft PWS in its entirety and provide comments and feedback to include recommended additions, deletions, or revisions that you feel should be considered by the USAF. If you choose, you may insert comments directly into the Microsoft Word copy of the PWS and submit them electronically to the Contracting representative listed below.</p>
<p><strong>The USAF A-10 SPO is most interested in the following topics with respect to the PWS:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. Is the requirement/scope clearly stated and understandable?</p>
<p><br />2. Are all requirements/instructions clear and unambiguous to a maintenance facility?</p>
<p><br />3. Are there any areas where the government is being too restrictive and not permitting the use of commercial best practices or industry standards?</p>
<p><br />4. Is sufficient detail provided throughout the document to prepare an accurate proposal?</p>
<p><br />5. Do any requirements seem unreasonable or unrealistic?</p>
<p><br />6. Are there any additional requirements that should be added to help ensure that the government meets its contract objectives and receives a quality deliverable?</p>
<p><br /><strong>In addition to feedback on the PWS, the USAF A-10 Program Office is also interested in receiving responses to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. This contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity requirement. The government is aware that industry would prefer the largest minimum quantity of orders possible to be guaranteed on the contract ordering period. Given an estimated workload of 3-6 aircraft inductions per year for SLEP/SSI, please comment on the impact to a price proposal if the minimum quantity was set at one aircraft induction per year versus three aircraft per year.</p>
<p>2. What kind of import/export fees or restrictions may be imposed on this contract by the host nation in which your maintenance facility is or is to be located? Please reference or provide any applicable agreements between the host nation and the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>3. What kind of learning curve should be expected for this requirement? What effect will the expected learning curve have on the flow days for completing an aircraft delivery?</p>
<p>4. For other than incumbent contractors, what is the estimated stand-up period after contract award to be ready to induct the first aircraft? Please comment on various considerations such as configuring a facility, obtaining necessary equipment/materials, training a work force, etcetera. What kind of ideas/options may be available to minimize the stand-up period?</p>
<p>5. What kind of source selection criteria should the Government consider using in the solicitation to select a contractor that is qualified, capable, and can provide the "best value" to the Government?</p>
<p>6. Are there any aspects of this requirement where a contractor could suggest additional value to the government above and beyond what the government is currently requesting?</p>
<p>7. Given that the U.S. Government is under a tight schedule to meet the desired contract award date, do you feel it is desirable/beneficial for the government to issue a draft RFP prior the formal RFP? Please comment on the perceived benefits and consequences of a draft RFP for this effort.</p>
<p>8. For commercial aircraft repair contracts similar in nature to this requirement, what kinds of warranty terms are included for the work performed?</p>
<p>9. What kind of contractor performance assessment metrics are used in commercial aircraft repair contracts to assess the quality and timeliness of the work performed?</p>
<p>10. Do you foresee any specific problems with diminishing sources of supply or problems procuring any needed materials/equipment?</p>
<p>11. Past experience has revealed issues with providing foreign contractors U.S. Air Force Technical Orders (TOs). What is your experience dealing with technical data on U.S. Government contracts? What suggestions can you offer to reduce problems associated with foreign contractors obtaining/managing a TO library?</p>
<p>12. The government is interested in including incentive-fee terms in this contract which would provide additional compensation to the contractor for meeting schedule and/or quality/performance objectives. Do you feel it is desirable to include such terms? What kind of objectives and assessment metrics should be included in the contract to provide the basis for the incentive-fee? Are there any applicable examples of similar terms used in commercial contracts?</p>
<p>13. If you consider yourself a qualified source for this requirement but for whatever reason do not intend to bid on this requirement, what is your main reason(s) for not bidding? What can the government do to make this requirement more attractive?</p>
<p>14. Are you interested in attending an Industry Day at Hill AFB, Utah to discuss this requirement directly with the USAF A-10 Program Office?</p>
<p><br />Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this RFI is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration factor in this or any other U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, a formal Request for Proposal will be released at a later date. Please direct all questions related to this synopsis to the U.S. Government Contracting Officer listed below.</p>
<p><br />With the exception of questions posed regarding this requirement which will be answered and posted as updates to this RFI, all other information provided in response to this RFI will be treated as Contractor Proprietary and protected as such.</p>
<p><br />We thank you for taking the time to review this requirement and provide your feedback and recommendations. The information collected will greatly assist the U.S. Government in assuring the success of this planned solicitation. If you have any questions regarding this RFI or the subject requirement, please contact the contracting representative below.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - USAFE</span></strong>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from interested industry sources to aid the U.S. Government in the development of the contracting strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for in-theater depot maintenance services. This requirement will support United States Air Force A-10C aircraft stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</span>. The information requested is for planning purposes only and DOES NOT COMMIT the U.S. Government to provide compensation for information requested nor does it commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This notice does not provide any direction nor does it change any contractual obligations to sources currently under contract with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the Warthog, is a highly maneuverable, low-altitude, close air support aircraft built around a 30mm seven-barrel Gatling gun and powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans. The aircraft is designed for combat survivability and can employ a variety of free-fall and precision guided munitions as well as a full compliment of self-protection chaff and flares. The first production Fairchild Republic A-10A was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in October 1975 and achieved Initial Operating Capability in 1977. In 2006, the USAF began modifying A-10A aircraft with the Precision Engagement (PE) modification which adds upgraded cockpit displays, digital stores management, advanced targeting pod integration, and other improvements. Precision engagement modified aircraft are designated as the A-10C.</p>
<p><br />The A-10C has surpassed its original design life but has been tasked to remain in service with the USAF until at least 2028. However, as result of the 30+ years of operational service, the aircraft is yielding to the effects of fatigue and corrosion. To extend the life of the aircraft, the USAF has implemented depot-level maintenance inspection/repair programs for the wing, fuselage, nacelle, and other fatigue-critical components. These inspection/repair programs are designated as the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and Scheduled Structure Inspection (SSI). SLEP is a once-per aircraft procedure that began in Fiscal Year 2002 (FY02) and is scheduled to be completed on all aircraft by Fiscal Year 2013 (FY13). Once an aircraft has undergone SLEP, an SSI will be accomplished every 2000 flying hours or 1600 landings, or 8 years (whichever comes first) until the end of its service life.</p>
<p><br />Since 1993, the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) has operated a squadron of approximately 22 A-10C aircraft. These aircraft are operated, maintained, and employed by the 52nd Fighter Wing, Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. To reduce the costs and issues associated with ferrying aircraft from Spangdahlem AB to the Continental United States for depot level maintenance, the USAFE requested the establishment of a contractor depot facility within the European theater. In 2001, the A/OA-10 System Program Office (SPO) awarded a contract through fair and open competition to establish an in-theater depot facility to support USAFE A-10 aircraft. The period of performance on the existing depot-services contract is nearing conclusion. As required by U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, the A/OA-10 SPO is pursuing a follow-on competition to select a contractor to perform the requested in-theater depot services beginning in FY10.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />The A/OA-10 System Program Office is seeking interested sources to provide in-theater depot maintenance support for the 22 USAFE A-10C aircraft. Depot-level maintenance is defined as that materiel maintenance requiring major overhaul or a complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical assistance and performing that maintenance beyond the responsibility or capability of lower levels of maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The specific work requirements to be accomplished on this proposed contract order are outlined in the attached PWS. This PWS is still in draft form and is subject to change. Please note that the work requirements in the work specification attachments for aircraft paint, SLEP and SSI have been removed from the PWS for the purpose of this RFI. These attachments will contain the specific inspection criteria and additional work requirements for these services. Please direct any questions related to the work requirements for these efforts to the Contracting Representative listed in this RFI.</p>
<p><br />The U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of Spangdahlem AB, Germany.</p>
<p><br /><strong>INSRUCTIONS FOR INTERESTED SOURCES</strong></p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is an invitation for all interested and qualified sources to review the draft PWS and provide the USAF A-10 Program Office feedback and other information to be considered for planning purposes. In addition, you may ask questions regarding this requirement which will be answered by the USAF A-10 System Program Office (SPO) and posted as updates to this notice. All responses should be submitted to the U.S. Government Contracting representative listed below. <br />Please review the draft PWS in its entirety and provide comments and feedback to include recommended additions, deletions, or revisions that you feel should be considered by the USAF. If you choose, you may insert comments directly into the Microsoft Word copy of the PWS and submit them electronically to the Contracting representative listed below.</p>
<p><strong>The USAF A-10 SPO is most interested in the following topics with respect to the PWS:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. Is the requirement/scope clearly stated and understandable?</p>
<p><br />2. Are all requirements/instructions clear and unambiguous to a maintenance facility?</p>
<p><br />3. Are there any areas where the government is being too restrictive and not permitting the use of commercial best practices or industry standards?</p>
<p><br />4. Is sufficient detail provided throughout the document to prepare an accurate proposal?</p>
<p><br />5. Do any requirements seem unreasonable or unrealistic?</p>
<p><br />6. Are there any additional requirements that should be added to help ensure that the government meets its contract objectives and receives a quality deliverable?</p>
<p><br /><strong>In addition to feedback on the PWS, the USAF A-10 Program Office is also interested in receiving responses to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. This contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity</p>
<p>requirement. The government is aware that industry would prefer the largest minimum quantity of orders possible to be guaranteed on the contract ordering period. Given an estimated workload of 3-6 aircraft inductions per year for SLEP/SSI, please comment on the impact to a price proposal if the minimum quantity was set at one aircraft induction per year versus three aircraft per year.</p>
<p>2. What kind of import/export fees or restrictions may be imposed on this contract by the host nation in which your maintenance facility is or is to be located? Please reference or provide any applicable agreements between the host nation and the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>3. What kind of learning curve should be expected for this requirement? What effect will the expected learning curve have on the flow days for completing an aircraft delivery?</p>
<p>4. For other than incumbent contractors, what is the estimated stand-up period after contract award to be ready to induct the first aircraft? Please comment on various considerations such as configuring a facility, obtaining necessary equipment/materials, training a work force, etcetera. What kind of ideas/options may be available to minimize the stand-up period?</p>
<p>5. What kind of source selection criteria should the Government consider using in the solicitation to select a contractor that is qualified, capable, and can provide the "best value" to the Government?</p>
<p>6. Are there any aspects of this requirement where a contractor could suggest additional value to the government above and beyond what the government is currently requesting?</p>
<p>7. Given that the U.S. Government is under a tight schedule to meet the desired contract award date, do you feel it is desirable/beneficial for the government to issue a draft RFP prior the formal RFP? Please comment on the perceived benefits and consequences of a draft RFP for this effort.</p>
<p>8. For commercial aircraft repair contracts similar in nature to this requirement, what kinds of warranty terms are included for the work performed?</p>
<p>9. What kind of contractor performance assessment metrics are used in commercial aircraft repair contracts to assess the quality and timeliness of the work performed?</p>
<p>10. Do you foresee any specific problems with diminishing sources of supply or problems procuring any needed materials/equipment?</p>
<p>11. Past experience has revealed issues with providing foreign contractors U.S. Air Force Technical Orders (TOs). What is your experience dealing with technical data on U.S. Government contracts? What suggestions can you offer to reduce problems associated with foreign contractors obtaining/managing a TO library?</p>
<p>12. The government is interested in including incentive-fee terms in this contract which would provide additional compensation to the contractor for meeting schedule and/or quality/performance objectives. Do you feel it is desirable to include such terms? What kind of objectives and assessment metrics should be included in the contract to provide the basis for the incentive-fee? Are there any applicable examples of similar terms used in commercial contracts?</p>
<p>13. If you consider yourself a qualified source for this requirement but for whatever reason do not intend to bid on this requirement, what is your main reason(s) for not bidding? What can the government do to make this requirement more attractive?</p>
<p>14. Are you interested in attending an Industry Day at Hill AFB, Utah to discuss this requirement directly with the USAF A-10 Program Office?</p>
<p><br />Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this RFI is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration factor in this or any other U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, a formal Request for Proposal will be released at a later date. Please direct all questions related to this synopsis to the U.S. Government Contracting Officer listed below.</p>
<p><br />With the exception of questions posed regarding this requirement which will be answered and posted as updates to this RFI, all other information provided in response to this RFI will be treated as Contractor Proprietary and protected as such.</p>
<p><br />We thank you for taking the time to review this requirement and provide your feedback and recommendations. The information collected will greatly assist the U.S. Government in assuring the success of this planned solicitation. If you have any questions regarding this RFI or the subject requirement, please contact the contracting representative below. Please check back for any updates and answers to questions that have been posed.</p>

Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as commitment by the government. The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that can meet the requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Command (AMC).
<p>The DESIRED END STATE is a tool that will allow users worldwide to synchronize files located in a SharePoint document library to files located on a local flash drive. This tool must meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; Is useable on any Windows system worldwide without reconfiguration (i.e. either useable from the SharePoint site or from the flash drive)<br />&bull; Deletes files on the flash drive that are no longer resident in the SharePoint document library<br />&bull; Doesn't require elevated permissions to run<br />&bull; Supports Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC) authentication to the SharePoint site<br />&bull; Is configurable to specific folders in the SharePoint document library</p>
<p>The following optional requirements are preferable but not required:<br />&bull; Prompts the user for input and synchronize specific files based on input<br />&bull; Works with any Web or Network store not just SharePoint</p>
<p>At a minimum the vendor RFI submissions should address the following questions/comments:<br />1. Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards? <br />2. Is the tool easy to deploy, maintain, and use?<br />3. What kind of training is available for the users and administrators and how is it accomplished?<br />4. What features, whether listed above or not are in development and will be available in future releases?<br />5. What ports and protocols does the proposed tool use?<br />6. What other vendors are partnered with and support the proposed tool?</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this RFI who currently can make products available to the Air Force are requested to provide descriptions of concepts within 15 days after the posting date of this notice. Potential vendors may express interest, make comments and ask questions via electronic mail or fax comments or questions to the Air Force Communications Agency, Network Integration and Design Branch at AFCA.ENND @scott.af.mil, FAX (618) 229-5544. Vendors that meet Air Force requirements may be asked to demonstrate, at no cost to the government, capabilities and provide software/concepts for Air Force testing/review.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to extend the term of Contract No. TIRNO-02-C-00022 and TIRNO-02-C-00024 for Electronic Payment (E-Pay) Services with Official Payments Corporation and Link2Gov Corporation, respectively, for three additional option periods pending the competitive award of Request For Proposals No. TIRNO-07-R-00004.  The three additional option periods consist of two twelve month options and one month period.  After exercising FAR 52.217-8, the E-Pay contracts will expire November 30, 2007.  The IRS does not anticipate an award of TIRNO-07-R-00004 before the E-Pay contracts expire.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The IRS has a continuing need to have an Electronic Credit Card Payment Program that allows taxpayers to make electronic federal tax payments by means of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Internet application.  The extension of the E-Pay contracts allows for the IRS to continue receiving electronic tax revenue during the period that the competitive re-compete has been awarded.  This is an extension of a previously competed contract.  Discontinuation of services will have an adverse impact on actual receipts and the Service's goal to increase the volume of payments received electronically.  The extension enables the IRS to mitigate risks to the nation?s financial infrastructure and allows for successful transition to new contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.  The current contracts consist of an electronic payment system, which allows taxpayers to make federal tax payments through convenient, safe, and secure means, which reduces governmental costs and improve cash flow to the federal government.

<DESC>The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Schriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to award a contract for a data coordinating and management center to support the original research projects conducted by its investigators .  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees or less.  It is anticipated that one indefinite delivery /indefinite quantity (IDIQ), cost reimbursement contract will be awarded for a 5-year period with performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008.
The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the Eunice Kennedy Schriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) proposes to establish a web based data coordinating and management center to support the original research projects conducted by its investigators.  The Division encompasses three branches:  1) Epidemiology Branch; 2) Biometry Branch and 3) Prevention Research Branch [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/despr/].  Central to the DESPRs mission is to design, implement, and direct epidemiologic, behavioral and biostatistical research.  This includes reproductive, perinatal and pediatric epidemiologic research as well as research addressing child and adolescent health behaviors.  Original biostatistical methods also are developed motivated by analytic problems encountered in the design or conduct of the epidemiologic or health behavioral research.  As an intramural Division, DESPR is charged with research aimed at answering critical data gaps within its mission by utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies.  In addition, DESPR investigators are charged with the timely communication of research findings to both professional and lay audiences.  The Division typically implements 1-3 new studies annually on a government fiscal year basis subject to funding, with each study lasting from approximately 2-5 years.  This includes both epidemiologic and health behavioral research within the following broad domains and as described below:  etiologic research; clinical prediction; clinical efficacy or intervention trials; behavioral intervention trials with randomization at the individual or family/school level.  

The objectives of this contract are for the NICHD to obtain on behalf of DESPR:  1) a state-of-the-art web based data coordination and management system that offer access to all aspects of the data for each study in real time capable; 2) the ability of the web based data management system to track biospecimens or other types of data that may be collected in clinical sites or in study participants homes; 3) the production of a fully documented mega data file, supporting data files including quality assurance documentation and analytic files or other requirements as needed; 4) the ability to provide or subcontract for specific biostatistical methologic expertise and/or laboratory analyses as required for each study; and 5) the ability to provide other essential logistical support such as scheduling conference calls, steering committee meetings or data safety and monitoring boards (DSMBs) meetings along with the preparation of minutes for all such activities.

The Epidemiology and Prevention Research Branches typically conduct research that utilizes one of two types of designs.  First is the prospective cohort design for the longitudinal collection of data (particularly at critical or sensitive windows within human reproduction and development), biospecimens, third party data (e.g., fertility monitors or other PDA-type devices), and increasingly digital data (e.g., x-rays, MRIs, operative photographs, camera outfitted motor vehicles for young drivers).  Other important aspects of human reproduction and development that impact data base design and management is the couple dependent approach for data collection and analysis and the clustering of reproductive and pregnancy outcomes.  Study covariates are frequently time-varying and further dictate data structure.  In addition, the Prevention Research Branch often randomizes clusters (e.g., schools, summer camps) underscoring the importance of a data structure suitable for the implementation of hierarchical modeling.  Some research involves individuals while other research involves couples or families.  Hence, the ability of the offeror to support individual or higher order units of analysis is essential.  The second typical study design is the randomized trial.  The Epidemiology Branch conducts both randomized clinical trials aimed at assessing clinical efficacy or intervention trials.  The Prevention Research Branch typically conducts intervention trials involving individuals, families, summer camps, or schools as the randomization unit.  


General Notes to Offerors:

*The web based data management structure should be able to accommodate up to three new studies annually with each lasting from 2-5 years.  Studies largely involve prospective (observational) cohort designs or randomized trials.  Longitudinal capture of data from multiple sources and biospecimens is typically a part of the DESPRs research portfolio. 

*The web based data management system shall accommodate each project but ensure the flexibility to meet specific needs per forthcoming studies protocols.  The web based system should have the following characteristics:  1) flexible data collection including the ability to upload files from multiple sites or sources (e.g., labs, clinical facilities, study participants homes); 2) ability to accommodate multiple remote users (e.g., study participants entering data from homes) including flexibility in accommodating varying browsers; 3) ability to accommodate varying types of data including digital files; 4) ability to provide or subcontract of expert biostatistical or laboratory services as requested by the Government per the studys needs; 5) ability to provide logistical support for the scheduling, hosting and minute taking of steering committee meetings, DSMBs, and similar activities; and 6) ability to deliver interim and final databases and supporting documentation in formats requested by the government.



*DESPR intends for the successful offeror to be physically located offsite, but to have or establish a local office available within a 50-mile radius of 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD to facilitate regular interaction and in-person meetings needed for maximizing success.  

*The first two projects (FY08 and FY09 starts) are both prospective cohort studies involving newly pregnant women who will be followed through pregnancy and delivery (or pregnancy loss). Longitudinal collection of data from multiple sources (e.g., women completing self administered questionnaires or structured interviews, medical record abstraction, pregnancy journals, ultrasonography, Doppler measurements) is planned along with the collection of biospecimens (e.g., blood, urine, buccal swabs) at repeated intervals timed to gestation.  Approximately 3,000 women will be recruited in each of the two studies. Digital diagnostic files (e.g., ultrasounds, Doppler measurements) are expected for both studies.  Subcontracting for laboratory research is also anticipated for both projects along with biostatistical expertise in repeated measurement analysis, longitudinal analysis, and in Bioinformatics. 

*Two to three new research projects are anticipated for FY10 of which one is likely to include a randomize trial design.  All will be prospective in design with longitudinal capture of a multitude of data, digital files and biospecimens.

*DESPRs research focuses exclusively on people and, as such, the offeror must have proven expertise in the preparation of study materials needed for obtaining (often multiple) institutional review boards, Office of Management & Budget (OMB) applications, certificates of confidentiality, investigational new drug (IND) applications, and other necessary documentation.  In addition, proven expertise in the development and maintenance of manual of procedures (MOP) is required.  Changes to the MOP are expected to be documented in real time within the web based data management structure and to remain as a part of the official audit trail.

*Key personnel shall be designated specifically for each Task and may include the Principal Investigator, Study Manager, Biostatistician, Web Programmer and/or Data Manager.

A quality assurance plan will need to be prepared for construction activities.  The firm will be required to perform engineering design activities in accordance with NRCS standards and certify that designs meet NRCS standards.  
The goal of wetland restoration is to restore the hydrology and ecology of the selected site using the least amount of design, management, and long-term operational support to achieve the greatest possibility of restoring natural wetland communities with minimal or no adverse affects to on-site resources or to off-site properties.  The site hydrology shall be restored to support identified native wetland plant species. The firm shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate Water Management District and other appropriate entities in the development of the wetlands restoration plan and obtain appropriate permits from the local, state, and Federal agencies.  The wetlands restoration plans shall comply with the consultation requirements of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.  
The restoration design concept may involve the use of conservation practices such as water control structures, dikes, earthen blocks, etc., to restore the water level in the wetlands at pre-manipulation levels or higher elevations for longer periods of time.  An additional goal of restoration is to enhance and maintain habitat for wetland dependent wildlife.
  
The government contemplates the award of two to four Firm-Fixed Price; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts resulting from this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options.
Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual delivery orders.  The firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $5,000 in fees for the base year. The maximum order limitation is $1,000,000  for each year of the contract.  Delivery Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and/or environmental engineering services consisting of those needed to design and implement a wetland restoration plan.  Specifically, engineering services are required to perform all phases of preliminary investigation, design, and construction supervision of structures and other practices as needed for successful implementation and operation of a wetland restoration plan.  Services requested may require (1) field investigations to perform engineering surveys, geologic and soils investigations, (2) design and preparation of engineering plans and construction specifications in accordance with NRCS standards, specifications, polices, and documentation requirements as set forth in the National Engineering Manual, National Engineering Handbooks, National Engineering Field Handbook, and Florida supplements to the referenced manuals and handbooks.
These open-ended contracts could include design for repair and replacement of existing systems and/or design review of other A&E firms.  Services may involve direct consultation, supervision of construction for a specific project, including reviews and approvals of shop drawings, material selections, and quality control testing such as those associated with concrete placement and earth fill compaction.  Responses should include proposed sub-consultants for all disciplines including civil, agricultural, environmental, geo-technical, biologist, cultural resource specialist, and soil mechanics engineering.  Responses should also include the qualification of personnel and description of facilities, materials, equipment and services to perform the type of tasks described by this notice.  The preparation of construction and design documents in electronic format and with approved NRCS computer software is required.  All design drawings must be submitted using the latest AutoCAD, version 2000 or later or other similar CAD software that is directly convertible to AutoCAD.
The estimated value of the proposed construction projects is between $1 million and $5 million.  Funding is through the NRCS Wetland Reserve Program (WRP). 
 
SELECTION CRITERIA.  Project manager must be a Registered Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Florida.  All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in descending order of importance: (1) Professional capabilities; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence, including soil mechanics, hydraulics, hydrology, hydrologic modeling, surveying, structure design, wetland restoration, wetland ecology, and other as required; (3) Capacity to accomplish work in the required time considering current contract work orders and services being provided to other clients; (4) Past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Quality control experience; (6) Geographical location in relation to the work assignment and knowledge of the locality of the project, provided that the application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and (7) Experience with NRCS standards and specifications.  
Firms must provide customer references with contact persons, addresses and telephone numbers, and bidding records (low bid vs. estimate) for all projects listed as related experience, and a project workload schedule showing proposed team members for the project period.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole-Source Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Rockwell Collins Inc. for System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) of the Block IA Modification to the E-6B aircraft, pursuant to the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  Under the proposed Contract, Rockwell shall install an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Upgrade (QTY 1 each), replace the Very Low Frequency Transmit Terminal (VLF TX) (QTY 2 each), refurbish the High Power Transmit Set (HPTS)(QTY 1 each) and procure associated Program Spares (QTY 1 Lot).
The Government does not possess adequate technical data to competitively award this requirement.  The APU upgrade must interface with the Environmental Control System (ECS) and the electrical load design elements which Rockwell is developing under the E-6B Block I Modification Contract, N00019-04-C-0101.  The VLF TX replacement must interface with the Block I Mission Avionics Processing System (MAPS) and the KG-333 Cryptographic Modernization equipment, which Rockwell is developing under Air Force Contract FA8722-04-C-0004.  The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the ECS and the electrical load design elements will not be available until FY10 when the Block I Modification Contract is complete.  The Interface Control Documentation for the MAPS Software also will not be available until the Block I contract is complete.  The Interface Control Documentation for the KG-333 Cryptographic Modernization Equipment will not be available until FY10, when the Air Force Contract is complete.  In order to meet a required Initial Operational Capability (IOC) date in FY14, SD&D for the Block IA Modification must be complete by Q3 FY 12.  Thus, there is not adequate time to compete this requirement and still meet the required IOC date.
A Solicitation is not available at this time.  When a Solicitation becomes available, it will be posted on the NAVAIR website at: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations. 
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by NAVAIR.

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawaii (NAVFAC Hawaii) is extending the current 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from November 30, 2008 to November 29, 2009 and is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) Section 8(a) certified construction firms with SBA Hawaii District Office or Section 8(a) certified construction firms with a bona fide place of business in Hawaii or Guam to participate in this 8(a) BOA Program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the Government reserving the right to exercise options up to two years.  The period of performance is limited to a firm's participation in the 8(a) Program.  Upon graduation from the 8(a) Program, the BOA will be terminated.  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified Section 8(a) certified construction firms ! that are located in Hawaii or Guam.

The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, and terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for construction issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code compete for each task order award.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, ! painting, and installing pipelines).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify the NAICS codes that reflect its expertise and qualifications for which it would like to be considered.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement.  The task order range is established at $25,000 to $1,000,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond for each task order proposal and if awarded the task order, will be required to furnish Performance and Payment Bonds.

<a href="mailto:Honegger.Harold@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Sciences International Inc., for the development of an issue paper evaluating published re-analyses of data from the TaiwaneseEpidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic. 
The primary purpose of this data is for the U.S. EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to develop a Human Health Risk Assessment to estimate cancer risk from exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs).  This Human Health Risk Assessment has undergone multiple review processes including Agency Review, Interagency Review, and External Peer Review by the U.S. EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB).  Each of these reviews consistently recommended the use of epidemiological data from the Taiwanese population as reported in Chen et al. (1988, 1992) and Wu et al. (1989).  Overall these reviews have recommended the same approach for quantitative dose-response analysis as outlined by the National Research Council (2001).  These epidemiological studies have been the focus of numerous re-analyses since their publication (Lamm et al., 2006; U.S. EPA, 2005; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003; NRC, 2001; Morales et al., 2000).   Some of these re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) challenge the qualitative and quantitative conclusions of the NRC (2001) and the SAB (2007). An issue paper evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) with emphasis on evaluation and application of their methodologies, qualitative and quantitative assumptions, and soundness of conclusions would provide useful information with respect to the current cancer assessment for iAs.  Sciences International Inc. is considered the only source to provide the expertise required to perform the work described in this purchase order based on the following reasons:
(1) Sciences International Inc. has completed substantial work on this project for Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through interagency agreement No. DW-89939822-01-0, entitled Review of Arsenic Related Documents.
(2) Sciences International Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform this work because it is a continuation of work that has been previously performed on an extremely complex data base with which they are intimately familiar.
(3) Sciences International Inc. has extensive experience in the preparation of technical reviews on numerous chemicals and chemical classes making them highly experienced in chemical hazard assessment.  They have also provided data collection and evaluation services in the environmental sciences for more than 16 years.
(4) Sciences International Inc scientists have performed hazard evaluations exposure assessments, dose response analyses and risk characterizations of environmental chemicals. 
(5) It would require substantially more resources (i.e. time and money) to bring another contractor to the level of expertise and experience required to conduct the precise analysis and work specified by this work assignment.  No other contractors were identified with the in-depth experience and knowledge of the previous work on the critical evaluation of recent analyses of the Taiwanese epidemiological data. 
The scope of work related to this issue paper will involve four tasks, as outlined below:
Task 1:  Preparation of Work Plan and Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP).  The contractor shall submit a work plan for the completion of an issue paper that provides a sound evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of re-analyses (Lamm et al., 2006; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003) performed on the epidemiological data from Taiwanese populations exposed to iAs with an emphasis on evaluation and application of their methodologies, qualitative and quantitative assumptions, and soundness of conclusions with respect to the current cancer assessment for iAs.  This effort would also include a literature search for relevant information to support the conclusions of the issue paper.  The work plan shall include a description of the overall technical approach, level of effort, staffing, and a schedule for completion of tasks.
EPA will review the work plan and clarify any questions with the contractor.  The contractor shall develop a JQM/QAPP for this project for the Technical Project Officer's (TPO) and Quality Assurance staff's approval.  The work plan and quality assurance statement shall be submitted simultaneously for approval.  The contractor shall not perform any work under this project until the JQM/QAPP is reviewed and approved by the TPO.  The contractor must address in the JQM/QAPP how secondary data will be evaluated for use in the project.  Secondary data is environmental or health data that was developed for a different purpose.
Task 2:  The contractor will participate in a conference call to discuss any clarification to the scope of work described within the work plan.  After this conference call, the contractor will proceed to develop a draft issue paper that will include, but not limited to the following:
a. Review of the available cancer datasets from Taiwan populations, mainly focusing on Chen et al. (1988, 1992) and Wu et al. (1989).b. Review of all analyses existing for these datasets (including, but not limited to Lamm et al., 2006; NRC, 2001; Kayajanian et al., 2003; Lamm et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2000; etc.) including a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses for each analysis.c.  A detailed rationale of the most logical approach for analyzing the Taiwanese cancer datasets as well as presenting logical explanations of alternative analysis for why those not chosen are inappropriate.  This detailed rationale should include a detailed account of the evidence (i.e., supporting data) supporting the conclusions.
Upon completion of the draft document, the contractor will then submit it to the EPA for review.
Task 3:  Upon receipt of comments on the draft version of the issue paper, the contractor will participate in a conference call to address any necessary clarification to the comments submitted by the EPA to the contractor.  Based upon written comments and discussions during the conference call the contractor will revise the draft issue paper. 
Task 4:  The final revised draft will then be resubmitted to the EPA within 30 days of the conference call at which time there will be an option to hold an additional conference call.  If further revisions are unnecessary, this conference call can be cancelled by the EPA PO. 










As stated above, EPA intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis.  Nevertheless, if any firm feels they are capable of performing this work, they must submit evidence of such capability within 15 days of this posting.Telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will not be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via email to honegger.harold@epa.gov

The mission of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect public health and safeguard the environment of the United States.  As a member office of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), the Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations (OIG/OI) supports this mission as it manages, sets policy, coordinates, and has overall responsibility for criminal investigations of allegations of: 1. Financial fraud involving procurement, contractors, grantees, and other recipients of Agency funds; 2. Criminal wrongdoing involving Agency employees and programs, laboratory fraud, and computer crimes; and 3. Computer forensic examinations and media analysis to identify, investigate, and help counter illegal intrusions into EPA's computer systems. 
The OIG/OI seeks acquisition and installation of undercover lights and sirens and Motorola XTVA Open-Face Mini-U vehicular adapters and associated equipment as stated in the requirements sections below.
The following document outlines, at a minimum, the required items and services for this acquisition, delivery/installation time and  location of work, award criteria, and any special requirements relating to this action.  
Please provide a fixed price quotation of all proposed costs for delivery/installation, terms of warranty on the items and installation.
Award of a fixed price Purchase Order is anticipated by the Government.  Quotations shall be evaluated using "best-value" approach.  All evaluation factors, including price, shall be considered equally.  Evaluation factors are: 1) The ability to deliver and/or install undercover lights, sirens, radio vehicular adapters and antennas in vehicles (as applicable) in an area within approximately a 60 mile drive from where the vehicles are garaged; 2) In order to reduce downtime of the vehicles, the ability to install radio equipment and lights and siren equipment at the same time; 3) Recognition by Motorola as an authorized Motorola Product Reseller and installer; 4) Terms of warranty on equipment and installation.	 REQUIREMENT
PART I: MOTOROLA XTVA OPEN-FACE MINI-U VEHICULAR ADAPTER AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
*Note: "Brand-Name -Purchases" - This requirement for Motorola Brand-Name items is made in accordance with of FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization)."
Justification for Motorola Brand-Name Purchase
Motorola portable radios (XTS 5000) are currently in use by OIG/OI Field Investigators.  The purchase of Motorola brand radio accessories, specifically compatible with existing radios is justified in order to meet the Continuity of Operations, reliability and safety requirements of working in a dynamic environment.  If vehicular adapters manufactured by other companies were purchased, existing radios would need to be replaced.  This would cause great and undue expense to the Government.DESCRIPTION: Motorola Radio Equipment for 23 OIG/OI Vehicles:	A. Motorola XTVA Vehicular Adapter, IMBE Open Face Mini-U XTS 3000/5000a. Motorola Q760 Next Generation Mobile Microphoneb. Motorola NLD 1976 VHF Radio Frequency Power Amplifieri. 35 Watt outputii. 136-174 MHz.c. Motorola NTN 8327 RF (Antenna Switch)d.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>
Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC, (BSA) under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886, for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), herewith solicits your proposal for the Conventional Facilities construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

PROJECT INFORMATION
The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 392,000 square feet. 

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of the NSLS-II and will house offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities. 

The proposed construction type for the Ring building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for the upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior. Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin or membrane roof systems. 

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines, and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces. Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete, with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines. The NSLS-II Ring Building has been designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces. Additionally, the building design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment. There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline and certain laboratory spaces that will require a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

This acquisition is a "Best Value" procurement.   Best Value employs a trade-off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE. <BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain potential solutions to protect soldiers against wire strikes.  Wire strikes by coalition forces vehicles remains a significant hazard to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  High profile vehicles such as the MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) families as well as HMMWV (HUMVEE) based platforms are at risk.  Increases in technological add-ons often increase the vertical profile of vehicles.  As a result Soldiers conducting mounted patrols are making contact with electrical power lines that cross over the street.  These wire strikes have resulted in vehicle and weapons system damage/loss and soldier injury.  <BR><BR>Units across various parts of the region have fabricated potential solutions for specific platforms however coalition forces require a universal wire strike mitigation kit for vehicles.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) for a potential acquisition of one or more of the potential solutions.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting white papers/proposals for Research and Development (R&D) projects which offer potential for advancement of Special Operating Forces (SOF) maritime mobility operations and capabilities. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. Request for same will be disregarded.

The USSOCOM reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. USSOCOM provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (if requested), or any other material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of USSOCOM to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.         

1.  The following general aspects/topic areas are examples (but not limited to and not in order of importance) of applied research and development in support of SOF combatant craft. (a)  Advanced hull forms having improved ride quality over conventional deep-vee monohulls, low multi-spectral signatures, high payload weight-fraction, high speed in a seaway, and good sea keeping and maneuverability throughout the range of operations. (b) Shock mitigating systems for crew and equipment. (c) Low signature antenna, weapon systems, topside equipments, and hull construction and outfitting materials. (d) Advanced light-weight composite materials with scaleable production processes for large maritime applications. (e) Lightweight ballistic protection materials and designs. (f) High performance diesel engines integrated with high propulsive coefficient propulsion systems. (g) Craft propulsion systems that take advantage of proven and efficient hybrid technologies and/or electric drives. (h) Integrated command, control and shipboard function monitoring systems to support small crew manning requirements and having improved human factors to reduce crew fatigue. (i) Small, integrated, sensors and maritime information/communication systems that provide real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) information and improved situational awareness. (j) Lightweight, integrated, stabilized weapon and threat detection/engagement systems. (k) Small, lightweight, reliable and easily maintained hull, mechanical and electrical systems capable of surviving in a demanding maritime environment. (l) Methods, alternative sustainable materials and means that extend craft material availability, improve production efficiency and provide a more effective materials recycling infrastructure. (m) Advanced concepts that have not yet been realized.  

2.  The USSOCOM requires a family of combatant craft to meet SOF maritime mobility and operational requirements.  Although the above research and development topics are applicable to a wide range of combatant craft, request that research and development proposals target technology development that support one or both of following specific combatant craft requirements. 

(a) A small, tactical craft with the following general requirements: (1)   Multi-function craft capable of infiltration and extraction from over-the-horizon. (2) Air transportable by fixed or rotary wing aircraft and deployable from other maritime platforms. (3) Crew of 1-2 personnel and carry 4-8 passengers and their associated gear. (4) Station keeping capability and maneuverability which is safely and tactically sound when conducting infiltration/extraction during across the beach operations. (5) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (6) Round trip endurance of 100+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 20Kts. (7) Fuel compatibility with USN requirements. 

(b) A long range and endurance craft with the following general requirements: (1) Multi-function craft capable in medium threat coastal to open-ocean environments. (2) Large payload capacity with the ability to launch and recover a SEAL Delivery Vehicle or combatant craft up to 40 feet in length.  (3) Operating endurance of 4 to 7 days. (4) Operating range of 1000+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 30 kts. (5) Able to support a minimum of 30 embarked personnel while providing acceptable levels of shock and vibration exposure. (6) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (7) Defensive and offensive weapons and countermeasures. 

3.  WHITE PAPER CONTENT:  Institutions having demonstrated research capability and the necessary facilities are invited to submit a white paper. It is not the intent of this BAA for institutions to establish new facilities.

The cover page should be labeled “WHITE PAPER” and should include the BAA number, proposal title, technology thrust areas addressed, and technical points of contact with telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address. This should only be one (1) page. The technical part of the white paper should not exceed four pages of text including appendices and should describe: the research and development objective; the technical approach; related work by the investigator or proposer; anticipated contributions/benefits to SOF maritime surface mobility; a resume of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the white paper; and an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort;. White papers exceeding any of these page restrictions may not be reviewed. IMPORTANT NOTE: Titles given to the white papers/proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not be merely a copy of the title of this BAA. 

4.  EVALUATION CRITERIA. White papers, and any follow-up full proposal submission, will be evaluated on the following criteria:  technical merits of the R&D; qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support the research and development; relevance of the proposed research to USSOCOM program priorities and requirements; and realism of proposed costs, and availability of funds.

5.  EVALUATION/NOTIFICATION:  The USSOCOM may use selected support personnel to assist in providing both technical expertise and administrative support regarding any ensuing proposals from this announcement. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  Initial evaluations of the white papers will be issued via e-mail notification.  Detailed technical and cost proposals will be subsequently encouraged especially from those offerors whose proposal technologies have been identified through the above-referenced e-mail as being of “particular value” to the USSOCOM. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  

5.  AWARD.  All responsible sources may submit a white paper, which may be considered by the Government. Small businesses are encouraged to submit white papers and joining others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. Based upon the evaluation criteria identified in paragraph 4 above, USSOCOM will award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  

6.  There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement. Formal full proposals for competitive review will be requested based on those white paper submissions judged most likely to meet program objectives. Proposal deadline date and format instruction will be provided at that time.  This announcement will remain open for six months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  White papers may be submitted  any time during this period, however to be considered for the initial round of review and possible funding, white papers must be received no later than 30 November 2008.  White papers will be reviewed on a quarterly basis thereafter.

<DESC>1. Title: Colposcopy Training Program for Women's Healthcare Providers2. Solicitation Reference Number: VA-101-09-RQ-0001 3. Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a written technical and price quotation. This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The NAICS code is 611710 (Educational Support Services) with a small business size standard $7.0M. All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency. Questions in response to this solicitation are due October 6, 2008 NLT 4:00 PM EST. The due date for quotations is October 17, 2008 at 4:00 PM EST. Quotations shall be submitted electronically via email to Shaundra J. Duggans at shaundra.duggans@va.gov. The solicitation title AND reference number shall be included in the subject line of ALL correspondence. 4. Statement of Work: (As a result of character limitations, only an excerpt of the Statement of Work (SOW) has been provided. Interested Offerors shall contact both Shaundra J. Duggans AND Priscilla Lee via email for copies of the SOW. Telephone requests will NOT be accepted.)  The purpose of this statement of work is to acquire a certified colposcopy training program for women health care practitioners. Colposcopy is currently available on a limited basis within the VHA, few women health care providers (NPs/PAs/MDs) are certified to perform these screening and surveillance examinations. Successful completion of this training program will result in an increase in the services provided as well as reduce the current wait times to have the colposcopy procedure performed.  This training will also ensure more rapid diagnoses and optimal health care treatment. The practitioners receiving this training will have a minimum of 2 years experience in women's health care. Additionally, a minimum of two practitioners (total of 80 practitioners shall be trained) from each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) will participate in this training program. Within the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), limited numbers of nurse practitioners (NPs), physician's assistants (PAs) and MDs are certified to perform screening and surveillance examinations to women veterans. Information from VHA front-line providers has documented gaps in staffing and insufficient equipment to meet the needs of the growing number of women veterans who are seeking VHA services.  Many VHA women veteran health clinics are without adequate equipment or services necessary to provide care to a rapidly increasing number of women veterans. These inadequacies will only increase in the near future.  In FY 2007, a total of 255,374 women veterans utilized VHA healthcare.  With increases in the number of women in active duty military service relative to men, the proportion of the veteran population that is female is also projected to increase steadily.  Services and equipment are urgently needed to address existing gaps in medical clinics, radiology gynecology services provision, nurse education, and care coordination for women veteran who seek care from VHA. Approximately 39.9% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operations Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) returning veterans are women who utilize VHA. The sexually transmitted Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the key risk factor for cervical carcinoma.  Sexually transmitted infections are more prevalent in persons under 30 years of age.  Since the 67% of returning female OIF/OEF veterans are under the age of 30 the vulnerability of this population indicates the need for colposcopy and certified practitioners to perform this procedure. These statistics coupled with the anticipated increase of women veterans in the years to come, creates an immediate need for colposcopy training. The successful Contractor shall provide a comprehensive colposcopy training program for approximately 80 nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants and physicians.  The Contractor's training program shall, at a minimum, meet the following requirements: 1. Training course shall be certified/accredited by either the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the American Medical Association (AMA); 2. The training shall address, at a minimum, the following: a. Describe the anatomy, cytology, histology, and colposcopic findings of the normal and abnormal cervix, vagina, and vulva; b. Discuss the challenges of colposcopy and management of cervical neoplasia for selected patient populations, women infected with HIV, underserved women, and pregnant women based upon best available practices; c. Perform appropriate cytologic sampling, colposcopic evaluation, and biopsies (including endocervical sampling), and become familiar with instrumentation and necessary supplies, d. Provide hands-on sessions for the colposcopy procedure and biopsy techniques; and e. The Contractor shall submit a program evaluation after the completion of each training class. All training shall be administered and completed no later than September 30, 2010. Type of Contract:  Firm Fixed Price.

For Attachment 1, entitled, ?DRAFT ? Statement of Work (SOW)?.  
 
This is a FY 2008 action. The primary objective of the Government?s requirement will encompass focusing on expanding the use of electronic payment methods to collect federal tax payments and encouraging taxpayers to use electronic media to interact with the IRS.  The IRS is seeking to expand the electronic payments initiative through additional partnerships with private industry. To this end, the Government is interested in awarding contract/s that will increase the number of electronically filed balance due returns and other taxpayer forms and related payments.  We are looking for ways to build upon and expand this initiative to improve service for balance due filers who e-file and to attract others to the program.  Expansion shall include payment methods that do not require IRS to receive, process and store paper checks and money orders.  This may include, but is not limited to, the acceptance of electronic fund transfers, intermediary conversion of paper checks and money orders to electronic transactions, or credit card transactions.   The IRS has a requirement for a contractor to provide an electronic payment product that allows taxpayers to make federal tax payments through convenient, safe and secure means and to collect the appropriate service fees from the taxpayer to cover all costs incurred to deliver the services requested by the U.S. Government.  IRS further anticipates the award of a contract/s for a one year base period and four one-year option periods.  

The required services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief of 1997 (IRC 6311(d) (2), the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts to obtain services related to receiving payment by other means where cost beneficial to the Government.    The Secretary may not provide any fee or provide any other consideration under such contracts.  No U.S. Government appropriated or non-appropriated funds will be made available or utilized in performance of the resultant contracts.  The taxpayer will be responsible for paying the Contractor directly for services rendered.  
Potential offeror/s possessing the capability of providing these services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates the ability to fulfill this requirement. Documentation submitted should include specific experience with and working knowledge of Electronic Payment Services.   Please Note:  page limitation is hereby limited to 3 pages exclusive of the completion of Attachment 2, Section 508 Standards and provisions.

All responses to this Request for Information (RFI) shall include Company Name and address, business size and type (1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUB Zone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business), business and technical points of contact including e-mail addresses and telephone numbers.  Acknowledgement of your company?s registration in the Central Contracting Registration database www.ccr.gov is required.  

Any questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via email to the both points of contact as denoted herein on or before October 24, 2007 in order to allow answers to questions to be publicly posted before the required response date of 29 October 2007.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)&nbsp;Chemical Biology Consortium&nbsp;(CBC) is being developed to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer. The NCI seeks to coordinate academic and private drug discovery efforts with its own, and thereby expedite the entry of new molecular entities (NME) into oncologic practice. The program is being developed by NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), in conjunction with NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the NCI Director's Office, with guidance from external advisory panels. This effort will be managed by the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) Program. SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) is responsible for providing support for the key operational and technical aspects. It is envisioned that this Consortium will provide cutting-edge chemical tools for probing complex biochemical signaling pathways and will serve as the starting point for the elaboration of first-in-class targeted therapies. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific findings and NCI-supported clinical research to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer.</p>
<p>The CBC will establish an integrated network of chemical biologists, molecular oncologists, and compound screening centers from government, academia, and eventually from industry. The drug discovery strategy of the CBC is to expand current NCI programs by providing a coordinated focus on therapeutic opportunities in high-risk, under-represented areas, significantly advancing the discovery of novel compounds active against specific molecular and genetic cancer targets. CBC efforts will include recruiting extramural investigators with specialized expertise in novel discovery platforms as well as medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, molecular oncology, and other areas of drug discovery and development. The CBC will be centrally managed to coordinate the selection of targets and screening for agents that interact with these targets, and will then use an iterative development process to design and optimize drug "hits" into "leads." The CBC will benefit from access to the NCI's late-stage drug development resources and expertise.</p>
<p>SAIC-F is seeking technical proposals for Comprehensive Chemical Biology Screening Centers, Chemical Diversity Centers and/or Specialized Applications Centers. Participants are expected to support the progression of candidate molecules through formal milestones/Stage Gate discovery and development criteria established by Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) leadership in accordance with industry standards.</p>
<p>Participants will have an unparalleled opportunity to participate in a highly collaborative drug discovery partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Using state-of-the-art communication, data-sharing and project management tools, the CBC will effect a paradigm shift in the use of public-private partnerships to translate knowledge from leading academic institutions into ground-breaking new drug candidates for patients with cancer.</p>

<SUBJECT>Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) Human versus Animal Classification
<SOLNBR>DHARFI091608

<CONTACT>Renee Bayton, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 254-5387, Fax 202-254-5393, Email renee.bayton@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0 Request for Information (RFI)

1.1	Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), is seeking information on the availability of software/hardware associated with Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) for classifying humans from animals.  UGS sensors used for border security currently employ seismic, non-imaging Passive Infra Red (PIR), acoustic, or magnetic sensors. Personnel illegally walking across the border can be detected by the seismic, PIR, or acoustic sensors. However, these same sensors can be triggered by medium to large size animals (deer, burro, moose, livestock, etc). The classification capability to distinguish between humans and animals may involve software that would work with existing UGS sensors, hardware additions that would make existing sensors more capable, or new sensors. Any modifications to the UGS package for reliable classification should not raise the cost of current generation of UGS nodes significantly. For example, the incorporation of an expensive infrared camera into an UGS system (with transmission of imagery of a detected object) that significantly increases the system cost, does not meet the intent for this RFI. 
Sources able to satisfy the capabilities below are invited to submit information describing their capability. The submittal will include as a minimum: 

1)	A description of the enhanced UGS system that clearly identifies, (i) where non developmental items would be utilized, (ii) where modification to existing items are required, and (iii) where new developmental items are required.
2)	Expected performance of hardware/software for detecting and classifying humans versus animals that walk by the UGS system.
3)	Theoretical analysis and/or test results that validate the classification concept
4)	Any environmental or terrain conditions that might affect or limit the detection and classification performance.
5)	Cost and schedule estimates for prototype UGS nodes with classification of humans from animals.

1.2	RFI Operations

Current UGS systems deployed for border security normally contain a sensor/sensors subsystem to detect the presence of an object in the immediate area, a communications subsystem for reporting the presence of an object in the area, a power subsystem, and a control subsystem. The UGS system is typically buried with only the antenna for communications and in some cases the sensors (PIR, acoustic) exposed above ground. Prerequisites for an UGS system to be successful are to be covert and to consume low average power for a long lifetime.  Changes to an UGS system to permit classification of humans from animals or other sources should impact the covertness and lifetime of the UGS system as little as possible. This RFI does not intend to limit the approaches used for classifying humans from other sources that trigger an UGS sensor. The classification approach may involve
  
-	Signal processing approaches used with existing sensors
-	Data fusion approaches that may use information from multiple UGS in a geographical area or multiple sensor types employed with a single UGS system
-	Modifications to existing sensor types (seismic, PIR, acoustic) that will provide additional information that permits classification of humans
-	New sensor types that allow for human classification

1.3	Performance Features
                      
It is desired that the enhanced UGS system be able to: 

1.	Detect:  humans walking at ranges consistent with or better than current, conventional, UGS sensor capability (25 meters or greater for seismic and PIR)

2.	Classification: human versus non-human at 90%  reliability for events that may trigger the UGS sensor/sensors as to the presence of a moving object in the immediate vicinity; higher signal to noise ratio requirements may decrease the classification range from the detection range but it is expected that the classification range will be at least 75% of the detection range

3.	Environment: Operate in the environmental conditions typically encountered along the southern, northwest, and northeast border regions of the United States

4.	System Lifetime: Will not degrade system lifetime substantially from current UGS configurations and that a minimum lifetime of 1 year on battery is feasible

5.	UGS Node Costs: As a goal, the classification capability should not increase the cost of current generation of UGS nodes (in production) by more than ~25%.

Justification for Sole Source:  The Microsoft Campus Agreement is a 3-year program through Microsoft and its resellers that allows accredited academic institutions to take advantage of academic pricing. This Agreement is an annual subscription with Software Assurance that provides DINFOS with product upgrades as they are released for the 3 year life of the Agreement.  This agreement includes all Microsoft products currently in use at DINFOS.  This includes MS Windows Server, Windows XP and Vista, MS Project, MS Visio, MS SQL, MS Exchange, MS Office, and applicable client access licenses.  MS Campus Agreement provides DINFOS with a vehicle for purchasing multi-volume licenses for all Microsoft applications currently used and taught in the school.  The products include server and workstation operating systems, desktop applications, and development and database applications.  All staff and student workstations currently utilize Microsoft products for daily activities.  DINFOS currently owns a number of software packages used by staff and students for training.  This service is vital to the mission of DINFOS.  This proprietary, vendor-specific hardware/software is currently in operational use at DINFOS.  This is a 3-year lease agreement renewable yearly with CDW-G that was awarded the contract FY2005 through competitive acquisition.  The process to initially establish the paperwork baseline required by Microsoft for this service was extensive.  The current documentation required by Microsoft to remain in the program resides with CDW-G.

This announcement constitutes the only notice; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all quotes received by the closing date specified in this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<AWARDEE>EMD Construction Inc, 26042 Plymouth Road, Redford, MI 48239-2106 US
<DESC>The USPS Leased Space Accessibility Program (LSAP) typically consists of small scale handicap improvements to leased facilities throughout states of the mid-west.  Projects are awarded in groups of approximately 30 to general contractors pre-approved by USPS .  The buildings are predominantly wood framed structures with masonry or wood constructed bearing wall, with steel framed buildings tending to be located near major metropolitan areas. The improvements typically consist of:

PLUMBING:
Replacement of faucets, drinking fountains, installation of sink waste line insulation, water coolers, and occasionally the construction of a new restroom tying into existing services. 

CARPENTRY:
Modification of custom wood framed customer counters, installation of manufactured customer counters and tables, replacement of doors, closers and hardware, installation of restroom grab bars and occasionally the construction of exterior ramps.  Finish work is limited to repairing adjacent wall and floor finishes.

ELECTRICAL
There are no major upgrades.  Work is limited to capping unused outlets, reconnecting countertop equipment and an occasional new wired outlet.

PAVEMENTS
Work consists of limited replacement of damaged asphalt and concrete pavements, parking striping, installation of non-illuminated pole signs, and the occasional construction of concrete ramps with handrails.

<DESC>Award of the Secure Flight Resolution Center support services contract has been made to Professional Solutions. Solicitation number HSTS02-08-R-TTC159, and awarded contract number HSTS02-08-C-TTC158 are applicable to this requirement. 

The contract (Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Award Term Incentive) will have a ceiling in the amount of $20,269,737.32. This contract has a base year, three 1-year option periods and a potential for three 2-year award term incentive periods. The base period was awarded at $1,852,900 with $106,653.41 dedicated to surge support and ODCs. This contract was awarded on 09/30/2008 by the Contracting Officer Guy Galloway, who can be reached at Guy.Galloway@dhs.gov. This requirement was set aside for small business with the primary work location at Annapolis Junction MD and Colorado Springs CO.

This contract fulfills the requirements of the secure flight resolution center. As a component of traveler name matching, SF will create a Secure Flight Resolution Center (SFRC) to perform advanced threat assessments of travelers scheduled to fly, and to resolve related, open traveler assessment issues at check-in.  Customer Support Agents (CSAs), operating within the SFRC, will respond to calls from Airline Agents regarding open assessment issues, when a traveler is unable to print a boarding pass during the check in process.  The CSA will coordinate the resolution of traveler issues at check-in and will direct the Airline Agent to proceed accordingly.  Resolution may entail that the traveler be authorized for printing of the boarding pass or it may mean that law enforcement will need to be contacted for further involvement.  CSAs will interact with Secure Flight Analysts (SFAs).  SFAs will have access to intelligence resources enabling the SFA to notify the CSA of the correct resolution on a case by case basis.
