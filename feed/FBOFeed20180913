<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01790 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13) exceptions: (i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. A request for quote solicitation will be made through Federal Business Opportunities website and offerors will be able to respond electronically.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written proposal will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC><p>DSCA is working to improve its existing audit readiness efforts by strengthening internal controls and financial management practices, instituting sustainable business processes, developing guidance, and driving effective change throughout the Security Cooperation community. DSCA is responsible for two separate financial statements: DSCA Title 10 funds (Treasury Index 97) and the Security Assistance Account (SAA) Title 22 funds (Treasury Index 11). This effort is for non-personal services to provide Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Audit Remediation, Financial Data Reconciliation, and Managers' Internal Control Program (MICP) to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and Security Assistance Account (SAA).</p>
<p>Objective I: Develop and re-engineer the financial reporting framework for Title 22 that supports auditable Full Financial Statements. Identify unknown unavoidable deficiencies and risks associated with the SAA which includes: the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Trust Fund, the International Military Education &amp; Training (IMET) Fund, the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Program, the Special Defense Acquisition Fund(SDAF), the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), the Foreign Military Loan Liquidating Account, the Military Debt Reduction Financing Account, the FMF Direct Loan Program, the FMF Direct Loan Financing Account and other accounts that contribute to the consolidated financial statements. By driving a larger mission-based approach to the entire portfolio of business processes that aligns with their strategic goals, DSCA can drive greater transparency with foreign and domestic customers, Military Departments (MILDEPs) stakeholders, and industry.</p>
<p>Objective II: Achieve an unmodified or "clean" audit opinion for each DSCA financial statement. DOD has designated certain reporting entities to adhere to the same audit readiness efforts as congressionally mandated OMB reporting entities. As a designated "significant" entity, SAA must perform all audit readiness and remediation efforts in accordance with the FIAR Methodology, and must undergo an annual stand-alone financial statement audit in accordance with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. DSCA intends to continue to monitor, validate, and implement Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) that were addressed during initial discovery efforts of the SAA in preparation for a full financial statement audit. This will allow DSCA to enhance audit remediation efforts and improve its ability to meet mandatory FIAR and MICP requirements.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is 01 Dec 2018 - 30 November 2019. The requirement is for a twelve (12) month basic period and four (4) annual options. The estimated ultimate completion date is 30 November 2023.</p>

<DESC>NSN: 4820-01-157-8745. Item Description: Valve, Linear, Directional Control. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (79318) P/N 240355-4.
<p><br />Quantity: 38. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: CLIN 0001: San Diego, CA, CLIN 0002: Jacksonville, FL. Delivery Schedule: 365 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 27 SEP 2018. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source: Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. (79318).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, and the other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 25-50, and 51-76.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Great Lakes Region, Central Service Area, is conducting a Market Survey/Request for information to improve the Government’s understanding of the current marketplace and to identify capable sources.  Responses to the Market Survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB 8(a)’S), Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB’s), etc.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will utilized for planning purposes only.   No contract of any kind will be a result of this announcement.

The purpose of this Market Survey is to seek competent and qualified contractors to provide hot food service, including vending machine service for the employees and visitors at the FAA’s Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center located at 619 West Indian Trail Road, Aurora, IL 60506.  The vendor will provide all labor, supplies, materials, equipment (except Government-furnished equipment), etc. to operate a full-service cafeteria.  The facility runs 24 hours per day, seven days per week, but cafeteria operation would be operated five (5) days a week, Monday through Friday, during the hours of 6:30 AM to 7:00 PM.  Approximately 6:30 AM – 10:30 AM for Breakfast, 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM for Lunch and 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM for Dinner.   There could be approximately anywhere from 400 to 500 people who would utilize the cafeteria services Monday thru Friday.  This would be a no cost contract (vendor would not pay the FAA nor would the FAA pay the vendor).  Vendor’s income would be from food sales only.

Abstract:

<DESC><p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.</p>
<p>The 424nd Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Pre-solicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements exist.

DISCLAIMER

This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this Notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice.

Background: Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (GCVHCS) Pathology & Laboratory
Medicine Service (P&LMS) is requesting the purchase of Maine Standards calibration/verification kits for the Beckman/Coulter Chemistry analyzers. The kits will serve to verify the functionally of the instruments that is required bi-annually by accreditation standards, i.e. College of American Pathologist. Supply kits will be ordered for the following lab sites: Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, Eglin, and Panama City. Results of the studies will be submitted to Maine Standards for processing of data and reports from the study will be provided and will be kept on site for each lab for accreditation inspection.

Accreditation requires chemistry analyzer equipment calibration and linearity to be verified bi-annually using purchased kits that have known analyte levels. Instrument verification is required for accreditation purposes and the determination of operation issues that may need addressing

2.  Scope.   Calibration/Verification kits are specifically design for for testing on chemistry analyzers and contain the specific analytes that require performance study.  Kits come liquid and ready to be used kits or requires reconstitution with a solvent.  Historically, liquid ready reagents have been a reliable product and produce reliable results. Other products used have been a problem in the past due to, kits need reconstitution; do not have the required analytes in a specific kit requiring additional kit purchasing, and produce unreliable results.

3. Specifications/Characteristics: Ready-to-use test kits designed to assist in the documentation of linearity, calibration verification and verification of linear range required by our current accreditation inspection agency, College of American Pathologist.  The ready-made solutions (reagents that do not require to be reconstituted with a solution) will also provide assistance when troubleshooting instrument systems, reagent problems and calibration anomalies.  Multiple product configurations (kits) are available to meet the different needs of the many instrument systems available. The configurations are specifically formulated to maximize reportable ranges with no dilutions.  Each individual test kit can be used for two testing cycles for one instrument: Each test kit provides enough volume to complete two studies of calibration verification and reporting range validation.  

All VALIDATE products are U.S. FDA cleared for use as calibration verification and linearity materials. Labs inspected by all accreditation organizations have successfully used VALIDATE to satisfy their calibration verification and linearity requirements.  Equal-spaced level: Level 1 to 5 are prepared to create  equal deltas  as recommended by CLSI s EP06-A guideline for linearity testing. Most products also include a true  zero , the base matrix for the product designed to provide a zero result.

The requested items provide linearity testing with the range parameters required for calibration and testing needs:

<p>3.5 (Task 5) Cost of Not Accommodating the Warfighter <br />Background: The types and numbers of people who will use, operate, maintain, and sustain a system define the "target populations" for the system. These target populations and the training and resources needed to initially enable, and then sustain them, determine a significant portion of the long-term costs and affordability of the system. In fact, about half of the life-cycle cost of a system is people and that cost may rise with the wrong people or as a consequence of poor design. People costs are also often cost multipliers for fielded systems since multiple people are often involved (e.g., operators, maintainers), they interact with the system over its lifetime, and people both cause and accommodate system degradations and failures. In essence, not accommodating the Warfighter tends to magnify the future costs of the system. <br />As a recent example of this, the Army G-1 MANPRINT (Manpower Personnel Integration; now HSI, Human-Systems Integration) Assessment for the WIN-T (Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 2) system (Drillings, 2009) warned of issues with reduced crew sizes, dependence on contractor support, increased training requirements, product complexity resulting in increased performance times, error rates, and crew workloads, and exceeding the capabilities of the target MOS's. Most of these predictions were accurate and WIN-T has since been re-engineered to address these human system integration (HSI) short-falls. The MANPRINT Assessment had cited these issues as "risks." Had cost estimates been included they could have influenced design decisions sooner and saved re-design costs and initial poor system performance.<br />Even though trade-offs between human and materiel solutions are now more explicitly considered during Analysis of Alternatives studies, the consideration of human performance capabilities and limits is not yet optimal or quantitative. As system development proceeds, design decisions may be made that negatively impact the target populations when good quantitative data or analysis about them has not been made available or well considered. Rather than ensuring a design solution that best accommodates the characteristics of the Warfighter, system developers may decide that additional training or acceptance of additional risk is a more expedient solution. <br />This kind of result may be more likely when considering a squad or team. It can appear that more people means that someone is likely to have the needed or extra capability. It is critical that these Warfighter trade-offs become more rigorous and quantitative in order to fully identify and mitigate the overall mission risk and long-term cost impacts.<br />Problem Statement: How to quantify tradeoffs between warfighter characteristics and capabilities in terms of mission performance, short and long term costs, and/or safety/survivability risk? <br />Benefit to the Army: This study shall identify algorithms, methods, tools and metrics to enable HSI professionals, system developers, and program managers to quantitatively analyze and represent the impacts of trading against Warfighter characteristics and capabilities (e.g., accommodating the 10th percentile female physical parameters instead of the 5th; requiring higher ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) scores or additional training; not accommodating color blindness). Better quantification of these considerations shall support their inclusion in Return on Investment/Cost Savings and system/mission risk analyses. <br />Proposed Tasks: <br />&bull; Survivability-Habitability charts<br />o Complete the charts for health hazards and have them vetted by Army Public Health Center (APHC)<br />o Develop approaches for presenting the other non-environmental hazards<br />o Develop requirements for conversion of demo to web-site or other format accessible to the practitioner community<br />&bull; Population Based Data<br />o Develop requirements for conversion of personnel attributes spread sheet into a web based tool accessible to the practitioner community<br />&bull; Overall<br />o Aggregate into a set of tools that can be accessed in one location</p>
<p><br />3.6 (Task 6) Provide support to deliver and Maintain Tools, Databases, and Processes to Support HSI Analyses Early in Acquisition</p>
<p>Background: Currently, HSI domain tradeoffs are limited (e.g., manpower vs. personnel, manpower vs. HFE) and the results are not typically linked to impact on TOC. A notable exception is the Medical Cost Avoidance Model (MCAM), developed by the US Army Public Health Center (APHC), to support Health Hazard domain assessments. MCAM uses historical data associated with the severity and likelihood of potential health hazards to predict the costs of medical treatment and disability over a lifespan. <br />The HSI tool development community should collaborate to create an architecture that would fully support an integrated HSI assessment capability which would support the reuse of existing data and knowledge, facilitate tradeoffs among domains, and quantitatively predict system performance and cost. When a comprehensive enterprise architecture solution is complete, the HSI community should undertake an unbiased survey to select existing GOTS models, tools, databases, design techniques, and risk mitigation strategies that contribute to the elements of the architecture.<br />&bull; Identify and help develop quantitative tools that address the integration of HSI domains (i.e., the tradeoffs across domains) and the estimation of relevant safety, cost. Develop performance metrics and capabilities (models, applications) to enable HSI practitioners to proactively articulate HSI risk in support of the SE risk management process. Such tools would enable decision makers to see the impact of HSI and assess recommendations to mitigate the HSI risks.<br />&bull; Develop a user case on one of the Army's priorities such as cyber electromagnetic activity. This shall demonstrate the capability to leverage validated HSI datasets to quantitatively predict the impact of operational, environmental and system-design variables on human performance (e.g., time, accuracy, response quality) very early in acquisition and translate human performance to an emerging system's HSI performance profile (i.e., usability, suitability, operability, maintainability, safety, survivability) as an integrated element of the Systems Engineering process.<br />3.7 (Task 7) - Model-Based Experimentation and the Human Viewpoint Methodology to Support the Development of the Next Generation Combat Vehicles simulation models.</p>
<p>Task 1 Develop a model-based experimentation paradigm to establish a context for data collection and simulation model design to ensure an accurate and thorough understanding of the problem space. Providing post simulation data analysis that examine the model outcomes from the perspective of the specific stakeholder questions and provides outcomes in formats customized to support decision-making. The combined processes links the modeling effort to the strategic problem domain and frames the simulation results for the stakeholder's needs. 35K</p>
<p>3.8 (Task 8) HPM for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV)-Phase 1 Experimentation (NEW)</p>
<p>Background: The Army's current requirements and capabilities development practices take too long. On average, the Army takes from 3 to 5 years to approve requirements and another 10 years to design, build, and test new weapon systems. The Army has stood up eight priority CFTs to pilot a flat organizational construct enhanced by centralized planning and decentralized execution to deliver the best possible return on investment for Soldiers. The Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) is one of the eight priority CFTs. The NGCV consists of two platforms: a Robotic Combat Vehicle that delivers decisive lethality and overmatch in a future operational environment as part of a unmanned/manned team executing combined arms maneuver and a Manned Fighting Vehicle that maneuvers Soldiers to a point of positional advantage to engage in close combat and deliver decisive lethality during the execution of combined arms maneuver, while simultaneously controlling maneuver robotics and semi-autonomous systems. A critical component of the NGCV is the reduced manning of these vehicles to a two man crew.</p>
<p>&bull; HPM for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Phase 1 Experimentation. <br />The Contractor shall perform the following tasks in support of an IMPRINT analysis looking at the performance of the reduced two man crew in NGCV operations. <br />o Develop a performance shaping factor (PSF) for Galvanic Skin Responses (GSRs) to workload demands.<br />o Conduct research for task sequencing and task times as necessary for two and three man crews prior to the MET-D experiment. <br />o Includes 1 week TDY to TARDEC, Warren, MI. <br />o Develop two and three man IMPRINT Crew Model.<br />o Exercise models to develop predictions of tasks flows and timing, workload, and GSRs.</p>
<p>&bull; Hum HPM for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV)-Phase 2 Two Crewman Model Development <br />o Prepare analysis instruments for the MET-D Experiment in August-September at Ft. Stewart, GA. <br />o Includes 4 weeks TDY to Ft. Stewart, GA., one training session and three scenario runs. <br />o Analyze data from the MET-D experiment.<br />o Compare experimentation results to IMPRINT model results including task flows and timing, workload, and stress responses.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Workload Analysis <br />o Collect task analysis data to better understand the system, operators, and scenarios. This includes describing the tasks and actions as discrete steps and sequences, obtaining estimated performance times (or ranges) for each step, and workload estimates for each step.<br />o Build baseline IMPRINT models for the basic operation of the lethal and non-lethal system packages using two operators (driver/asset-controller).<br />o Establish demanding yet realistic scenario based on a Table 8.<br />o Tailor the baseline tasks to fit the scenario.<br />o Execute the model capture workload, throughput, utilization and bottleneck results. <br />o Play "what if" with notional changes to any of the processes, resources, timing, etc. to reduce workload and/or improve the overall task and mission performance.</p>
<p>3.9 (Task 9) Human System Integration Capability Based Analysis <br />This PWS outlines deliverables to be produced in support of current Army modernization objectives and early, often use of HSI in the Defense Acquisition Process. Case studies prove that early engagement of Army HSI improves program and Warfighter outcomes. DoD Instruction 5000.02 mandates that HSI be "included as an integral part of a total system approach to weapon systems development and acquisition. The effort shall increase the effectiveness, efficiency and adoption of Army HSI practices and tools for acquisition on an Army and DOD-wide scale.</p>
<p>o Develop HSI educational material that include a flip book and a digital application that covers all the domains of HSI to assistance practitioners in conducting His analysis and reporting.<br />o Develop a video emphasizing the value of early and often implemented HSI across and according to the Defense Acquisition Process<br />o Develop at least one customer case study to assist HSI practitioners and PM in understanding and implementing the HSI analysis across the acquisition cycle. <br />o Develop a web site that serves as a foundational communication portal for HSI Practitioners ("home" for branding, marketing materials, messaging, events, Gap updates and linkable content ((e.g., Body of Knowledge, Standards) and PEO sites))<br />o Develop a mobile app for PMs to learn more about why and when to engage HSI early and often in the Acquisition Process and how funding works (HSI research sources vs. HSI reimbursable activities).<br />&bull; Define strategy and objectives <br />&bull; Conduct technical assessment <br />&bull; Define specifications (e.g., native app (manage and update through app store) or web app (dependent, easy to update)) <br />&bull; Explore future use (gamified learning experience/usage data for certification</p>
<p><br />3.10 (TASK 10) Cost and Readiness Benefits of Implementing HSI-Based Mitigation Strategies for Maintenance Processes<br />Deficiencies in Army maintenance procedures for ground combat vehicles are resulting in avoidable personnel, medical and operations costs, and ultimately affecting Total Army Force readiness. The following tasks shall be performed to examine various mitigation strategies to reduce costs and improve readiness for a select ground vehicle and specific maintenance process that has been identified by government researchers as injury prone to soldiers.<br />o Support data and literature review to modify IMPRINT model to conduct analysis using a government selected Army maintenance unit as a case study to determine the cost impact of the identified critical maintenance error and readiness using imprint maintenance modeling. <br />o Using IMPRINT maintenance model, model the impact of HSI-based mitigation strategies of identified maintenance process inefficiencies on readiness and cost. Model outputs shall identify mitigation strategies that provide maximize potential ROI in terms of readiness and cost reduction.<br />o Review and contribute to final analysis report.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong>Program Title</strong>: Consolidated Product-Line Management Plus (CPM Plus)<br /><strong><br />Introduction<br /></strong>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Orlando is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest and technologies available to support the CPM Plus acquisition. The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI's) Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) Live Training Transformation (LT2) CPM Plus approach focuses on the requirements, development, execution, management, and synchronization of the LT2 Product-Line (P/L). The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. Based on responses to this Sources Sought Notice, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Disclaimer</span>: This Sources Sought is for informational purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) to be submitted. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary.<br /><strong><br />Background<br /></strong>In 2001, PEO STRI put the LT2 P/L strategy in place. Today, through the use of the current CPM Next contract, PM TRADE builds and maintains the LT2 P/L systems in support of home station training, deployed training, urban operations training, maneuver combat training centers training, and instrumented live-fire range training. The LT2 P/L provides state-of-the-art training systems to the warfighter using over 186 common reusable software components, service-oriented architecture services, architectural infrastructure, interfaces, standards, processes, and information technology assets.<br /><br />With 21 LT2 products fielded to over 200 sites globally, the LT2 P/L successfully employs technical and acquisition strategies that significantly reduce fielding time, minimize acquisition costs, enable total ownership cost reductions, and enhance training benefits afforded to the warfighter.<br /><strong><br />Requirement Description<br /></strong>The CPM Plus contract will continue to manage the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L. The CPM Plus contract will continue to meet the requirements for a consolidated streamlined approach that:<br /><br />1) Protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment.<br /><br />2) Continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LT2 P/L Construct.<br /><br />3) Continues to provide PM TRADE with efficient, effective, and agile methods to deliver military training products.<br /><br />CPM Plus is the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a systems life cycle within a System-of-Systems (SoS) environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based. CPM Plus will continue to evolve the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of LT2 products. CPM Plus will enable using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.<br /><br />The anticipated nature and complexity of the LT2 P/L work tasks (ranging from P/L architectural development, system development, SoS management to P/L core asset variability, and configuration management) associated with CPM Plus requires mature and established processes, and therefore, at least a level 3 CMMI company rating.<br /><strong><br />Acquisition Strategy Planning Information<br /></strong>The following Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) are attached to this Sources Sought:<br /><br />1) CPM Plus Base Statement of Work<br />2) CPM Plus CTIA Statement of Work<br />3) CPM Plus LT2 Construct Statement of Work<br />4) CPM Plus CTC-IS PDSS Statement of Work<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Vehicle</span>: Based upon the current LT2 P/L strategy approach executed under the current CPM Next contract, and successes garnered from that approach, (cost avoidances of over $800 million as one example since LT2 P/L inception) the anticipated contract methodology is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with delivery orders under the ID/IQ contract to accomplish the expected work. The CPM Next contract has had to date 22 delivery orders.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Type</span>: Delivery order contract types under the CPM Plus overarching contract are anticipated to be consistent with the CPM Next contract - multiple types that provide flexibility and agility to the using program offices that want to garner the benefits of the LT2 processes in place for cost avoidance and conformance to Army live training standards.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Ceiling</span>: The CPM Next contract is a five-year, single-award ID/IQ contract with a total ceiling of $415M. It is anticipated that the CPM Plus will be an eight-year, single-award ID/IQ contract with a total ceiling of approximately $800M.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />NAICS Code</span>: The following NAICS codes are currently under consideration for CPM Plus:<br /><br />- 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing<br />- 541511, Custom Computer Programming Service<br />- 541512, Computer Systems Design Services<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Acquisition Time Estimates</span>:<br />1) Sources Sought information request due by 13 March 2018<br />2) Industry Day TBA at PEO STRI in Orlando, FL, with industry one-on-one discussions with those interested in being prime contractors in conjunction with the Industry Day<br />3) Draft RFP release Government Fiscal Year 2019, 1st quarter (October - December<br />2018)<br />4) RFP release Government Fiscal Year 2019, 1st quarter (October - December 2018)<br />5) Proposals due 30 days after RFP release<br />6) Contract award - February 2020<br /><strong><br />Response Submission<br /></strong>Information Paper Instructions: As a part of Market Research, the Government requests interested contractors provide up to a 10 page summary, inclusive of cover page, that addresses the following topics within the context of the LT2 P/L domain.<br /><br />1) Intelligent Data Analytics<br />a.

<p>The Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) has a requirement to receive a wide range of data from the NAVOCEANO survey platforms and satellite programs that provide data services to Navy METOC models and applications. This provides significant quantities of data that NAVOCEANO has to process, store, and deliver using the NAVOCEANO Storage Area Network (NAVOSAN). In order to accommodate this increase in data, significant upgrades to computer hardware, communications infrastructure, and software are required, as well as professional support to integrate the different components to ensure full compatibility with existing NAVOCEANO capabilities. In addition, NAVOCEANO must be able to receive, process and manage the scientific data as it comes on line. The complex level of the individual components and integration required has led to a need to have contractor support to perform performance monitoring and tuning on the integrated systems.</p>

<ARCHDATE>10132018
<CONTACT>Stumpf, Lora L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Shimadzu for an extended warranty plus service agreement for an NETL owned liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LCMS-2020).  This is considered a sole source to Shimadzu because, to the best of the NETL’s knowledge, based on market research conducted Shimadzu is the sole source provider for this service and therefore, the only known source that can provide this exact extended warranty plus coverage plan service agreement.  Shimadzu is the verified sole manufacturer, sales, tech support, and authorized service organization of their Shimadzu instruments.  Shimadzu uses their specifically trained service and tech support personnel to maintain their instruments.  This requirement is for a base year (10/01/2018 – 09/30/2019) plus up to four, one-year option periods.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 12:000 PM ET on September 28, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Lora Stumpf, via email at stumpf@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
