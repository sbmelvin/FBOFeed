<CONTACT>Elaine Felchle Purchasing Agent 70125042423306 EFelchle@gp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is preparing a report on comprehensive water quality and quantity needs of the Red River Valley in North Dakota.  Previous Reclamation studies have used the 1930's as the "design drought" for estimating potential future water shortages.  Some individuals and entities have commented that the 1930's drought was an anomaly that is unlikely to occur again in the foreseeable future.  Others have commented that a drought more severe than the 1930's should be considered. The objective of this contract will be to evaluate the effects of climatic cycles on streamflow within the Red River of the North basin.  Using existing data, the contractor will develop drought severity indices and estimates of recurrence for droughts of varying intensities, including the 1930's and late 1980's.  The contractor must submit a draft report to Reclamation by September 30, 2003. These data will be used by Reclamation as an aid in determining drought scenarios for hydrologic modeling. Competition is restricted to small business (NAICS 541690; size standard = $6.0 million average annual receipts).  Request copy of RFQ from administrative contact point identified above or fax your request to (701) 250-4326.

<DESC>DARPA's Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals for innovative concepts relating to advances in assured Command, Control, and Communications (C3); Intelligence Preparation of the Battlesphere (IPB); and Asymmetric Lethality.  The objective is to enable revolutionary advances in warfighting capability.  To achieve this objective, offerors should emphasize radical concepts that may contain high technical risk but if enabled would have commensurate high military payoff.  The first phase of the effort proposed (base) should support the technical feasibility of the concept.  Offerors should propose follow-on phases leading toward technology development.  Based upon the success of the base efforts, a subset of the selected proposals may have options exercised to initiate the technology development.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:  (1) Assured Command, Control, and Communications, (2) Intelligence Preparation of the Battlesphere, (3) Asymmetric Lethality.  PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING:  As much as $5,000,000 may be available in FY 2002 to fund research and development under this BAA.  Multiple awards during FY 2002 are anticipated.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA02-07 Advanced Technologies" (PIP) which provides further information on the above areas of interest, the submission, evaluation and funding processes, proposal formats, submission dates for briefings, proposal abstracts, proposals, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/, by fax, or electronic mail.  Requests should be sent to the administrative contact given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and five copies of the proposal to mailing address provided below.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA02-07 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No other formal solicitation regarding this announcement will be issued and requests for such items will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible non-foreign NONFORN sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  All administrative correspondences and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail, WWW, and/or fax for correspondence regarding BAA02-07.  Proposal may not be submitted by fax or electronically; any so sent will be disregarded.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) Overall scientific and technical merit in relationship to the revolutionary aspects of approach, (2) Potential contribution to the DARPA Mission, (3) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience, (4) Approach to Technology Transition, and (5) Cost Realism.  The PIP and other related information related to this announcement may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.

<DESC>NA This requirement is sole source to DriverTech Inc., 2212 S. West Temple #48, Salt Lake City, UT 84115.  The PM has been directed by Department of the Army (DA) to develop an Army-wide solution for emplacing embedded diagnostics on all surface Army Systems.  The PM's solution consists of a unit to be mounted on the host platform that performs similar functions and will use similar software.  The use of DriverTech's DT-3000 reduces the cost and risk to the government as it was developed and interfaced to the F amily of Medium-Sized Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), the subject vehicle of the proof of principle for testing our software.  In addition, market research performed in May 2002 revealed that the DT-3000 is diagnostics orientated and the general hardware of the system is most similar to the hardware requirements for the PM's solution specification.  As a result of the market research, we feel that DriverTech is the only company that can satisfy agency requirements at this time.  Contact Jacqueline Cole, Contract Specialist, (256) 876-6117, Debra Long, Contracting Officer, (256) 876-4153.  The closing date is 15 May 2003, 02:00 PM CST. See Note 22

The contractor's personnel shall be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The approximate duration of the contract is 6 months, and is expected to begin approximately October, 2003.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 - Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing the technical evaluation criteria; Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms; Phase 3 – GSA advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether it is likely or not to be a viable competitor in the next phase, based on the technical evaluation in Phase 1.  GSA shall inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents, which shall be issued to offerors approximately June 2003.  A competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations, receive and evaluate final offers.  A formal selection of a firm that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.

<DESC>The Naval Air System Command intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC) 6125 East 21st street Indianapolis, IN 46219-2058.   In 1996 NAWCAD Indianapolis was closed and privatized in-place in accordance with recommendations from the 1995 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission.  Title to the preponderance of all personal property located at NAWCAD Indianapolis has been transferred to Raytheon.  Raytheon possesses land and facilities formerly comprising NAWCAD Indianapolis under the terms of a long-term lease agreement with the City of Indianapolis acting by and through the Department of Metropolitan Development.  The requirement will provide for the refurbishment of five (5) GFE AN/ALQ-99 Interim Band 2/3 Transmitter Assembly Units, which include the Microwave Amplifier (3274AS109) and interim support for the Interim Band 2/3 program.  The tasks required to provide this interim support are composed of test, troubleshooting, repair, engineering, inventory control, testing aids, test equipment maintenance, procurement of shipping containers, engineering investigations, fleet liaison, technical consulting, logistic support, and spares procurement and/or repair as they relate to the AN/ALQ-99 Interim Band 2/3 Pod Kit program. The contractor shall provide overall project and financial management for all aspects of the Interim Band 2/3 program.  Some of the tasks that will be performed are project execution, monitoring, and tracking, technical consulting, status report preparation, and financial management tasks.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-(1)(2)(iii) services may beem deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.  The term of the resulting contract is planned to be a one-year period with up to 3 one-year options.  RTSC is the only known source that can provide the required integrated functional capabilities and services.  Interested parties may submit questions relating to this requirement to the NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Create an intelligence community focal point for riverine intelligence information.
<SOLNBR>N00600-03-R-1396
<RESPDATE>053003
<ARCHDATE>06142003
<CONTACT>Paul Martin, Contract Specialist, Phone 2024338494, Fax 2026850002, Email Paul_ED_Martin@fmso.navy.mil - Roscoe Crawford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-433-5387, Fax 202-685-0022, Email Roscoe_W-Crawford@fmso.navy.mil
<DESC>1.  Purpose:  Develop and populate a knowledge base of information on the riverine environment.  Create tailored geospatial and imagery products in support of riverine requirements.  Establish and maintain an analysis center for riverine intelligence production, both scheduled and ad hoc.  The goal of this effort is to create an Intelligence Community focal point for riverine intelligence information.

2.  Background:  Riverine operating environments pose unique challenges to military forces.  In Latin America, Southeast Asia, and many other parts of the world, the river is the primary line of communication between developed and remote areas.  In the remote reaches of many countries, a lack of government presence fosters an environment where illicit activities flourish.  These activities include the smuggling of weapons, illegal drugs and associated pre-cursor chemicals, and narcoterrorists/insurgents seeking to destabilize democratic governments to sustain their illegal activities.  In these environments, the rivers become the nexus for the illicit activities, as they serve as the avenue for undetected and unimpeded transit.  In order to develop and maintain the capacity to interdict the flow of illegal drugs, weapons, and terrorists, it is imperative to understand physical characteristics, demography, infrastructure, points of entry and exit, as well as threats associated with rivers.

3.  Tasks:   The contractor shall complete a series of tasks.  All tasks are to be undertaken in year one, with follow-on options to be determined on an annual basis for a period of five years.  

3.1 Task 1   Data Collection and Evaluation.  
Task 1A:  Canvass Existing Riverine Information:  The contractor shall canvas the Intelligence Community, Theater Intelligence Centers, Service Intelligence Centers,  academic and governmental centers, open sources, and other entities as required to determine existing type, availability, and accessibility of riverine intelligence information, databases, and products.  The contractor will compile and report on standards for scope and detail of existing riverine intelligence products.  This task will require some travel in order to create an inventory and determine the utility and compatibility of existing products.

Task 1B:  Canvass Riverine Operational Forces:  The contractor shall canvass the riverine operational forces in order to evaluate the utility of existing intelligence products in meeting operational needs.  The MCIA program manager and contractor team will develop a sample list of operational users to survey.

3.2 Task 2   Create a Knowledge Base.  The contractor shall create, populate, and make accessible a dynamic riverine knowledge base that contains riverine information germane to operational planners and intelligence analysts.  Using the Riverine Generic Intelligence Requirements Handbook (GIRH) as a guideline, the contractor shall create a web-based tool that catalogs available riverine information.  Access to the knowledge base shall be via web pages on both the MCIA SIPRNET and JWICs Intelink sites.  When data is not resident on MCIA controlled sites, hotlinks will be created as possible.  The knowledge base will contain both finished intelligence as well as raw information, and be searchable.  The contractor shall ensure that the knowledge base can be fully integrated into the MCIA Virtual Knowledge Base (VKB) and populated with information packets (geospatial, imagery and GMI) that are metadata tagged according to standards specified by the MCIA Program Manager and production staff.

3.3 Task 3.  Produce Riverine Support Packages.  The contractor shall produce Riverine Support Packages that meet standing, training, and deployed riverine requirements of the U.S. Marine Corps, and other DoD forces.  For the initial year of the contract, the contractor shall produce at least five Riverine Support Packages.  The target areas for the five products are to be determined by MCIA based upon the results of Task 1, and may include products for training purposes as well as target areas in Colombia, South America.  The contractor and MCIA will agree upon a production schedule for these five (5) products, with all work being completed within 365 days of contract award.  The contractor shall produce these support packages as geospatial and imagery packets, with metadata tagging consistent with digital production standards as directed by the MCIA Program Manager and production staff.  These packets shall be stored within the VKB for use within the MCIA Digital Production Process.

The contractor shall develop and maintain the capability to respond to ad hoc tasking for the production of Riverine Support Packages in support of expeditionary deployments.  The contractor shall, in close coordination with MCIA, maintain liaison with the Operating Forces in order to have accurate understanding of potential deployments and mission requirements.  In the event of an ad hoc operational requirement, the contractor shall, at the direction of MCIA, produce the support package in support of the expeditionary requirement in lieu of one of the products on the production schedule.  All ad hoc tasking shall also follow MCIA Digital Production Process standards for metadata tagging.

The contractor shall utilize commercial and USGS LANDSAT imagery in the production process, the product will remain UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/LIMITED DISTRIBUTION whenever possible.  This will facilitate processing of requests for foreign disclosure.  Where national imagery is available and useful, classification of the product may be at the SECRET level, but with an UNCLASSIFIED version available.  Other sources of imagery, including from airborne imagery platforms and handheld photography including the Defense Mapping & Reconnaissance Tool (DMRT) and iPix 360&#730; photography will be incorporated to enhance the product when available.  The following product description is intended as a guideline.  It is understood that a standardized data set – which is seldom available in a jungle environment such as in Colombia - is necessary to produce a standardized riverine product.  It is expected that the products will vary with the variable data sets available.

Target area for study will be no larger than 25 kilometers either side of a defined center point, and 2.5 km either side of the river.  Product will include a linked overview of the target area, with hotlinks to annotated image chips, with scale of approximately 1:15,000 to 1:20,000.  Product will include a printable Riverine Analysis Graphic (RAG) which displays the overview, key analytical information, and amplification information as available.  Products will be tailored to meet specific customer needs, but will at a minimum include the following:
  
·	Hydrographic data including river width, depth, and current, including seasonal extremes and typical monthly values.
·	Terrain vulnerability points, identifying points significantly higher that the surrounding area, and vegetation cover for those areas.
·	Land use characteristics, with change detection analysis where supporting imagery coverage is available.
·	Associated infrastructure including but not limited to airfields; roads, including well-trafficked foot trails; bridges; hydroelectric plants; other man-made structures, both permanent and temporary, in the coverage area including piers, launches and boat houses. 
·	Points of entry, and HLZs in the target area.
·	Population characteristics.

Task 3.4 Task 4.  Dissemination and Product Awareness.   The contractor shall, in close coordination with MCIA, inform potential consumers and providers of riverine intelligence of the availability and use of the Riverine Knowledge Base and the production schedule.  The contractor shall, in close coordination with MCIA, solicit feedback from the operating forces.  The contact list of riverine community members will be posted on-line and available as a part of the Knowledge Base.   Liaison will be established with US SOUTHCOM (Miami, FL), US PACOM (HONOLULU, HI), Riverine Center of Excellence, II MEF (Camp Lejeune, NC), Naval Special Warfare Units (Norfolk, VA), Joint Riverine Training Center (Iquitos, Peru), Special Operations Command (Tampa, FL), and Naval Oceanographic Office (Stennis, MS).  Liaison will also be conducted with other members of the Intelligence Community.

 4.  Deliverables:   The contractor shall deliver to MCIA:
	
·	A report of the results of Task 1, with recommendations for product content and target areas.  The report will present an assessment of available riverine products, weighing their usefulness to the operating forces.  Draft report due 3 months after award of contract, with final report due at 4 months.
·	POC list of Riverine Community from Intelligence Community and Operating Forces, reviewed and updated quarterly.  Due with report of Task 1, above.  
·	A Knowledge Base of Riverine Intelligence and Information, fully integrated into the MCIA Virtual Knowledge Base, and metadata tagged according to MCIA Digital Production standards, which inventories existing riverine information and intelligence products from the Intelligence Community and Operating Forces.  Draft due 5 months after contract award.
·	A web application to manipulate and search the Riverine Knowledge Base, compatible with existing MCIA systems and software, to include the MCIA Digital Production system. Website design suitable for posting on MCIA SIPRNET and JWICS homepage.  Draft/demonstration due 5 months after contract award.  Final implementation due at 9 months.
·	Five (5) Riverine Support Products as detailed in paragraph 3.3, and IAW the production schedule.  The first product will be due 6 months after contract award.  Products 2 – 5 will each be due at one-month intervals thereafter.  Products will be metadata tagged according to MCIA Digital Production Process standards.
·	A report and briefing of the results of Task 4, presenting customer feedback and recommendations for future production.  Report will be due 11 months after contract award.
 
5.  Special Provisions: The following caveats and restrictions apply:

5.1 Special Meetings: Following the award of this contract and prior to the commencement of work, the contractor and representatives of MCIA will meet to discuss provisions of the contract in detail.  The contractor will provide monthly updates of project status and a minimum of five in progress reviews at MCIA during the performance period.  These reviews will be conducted between the contractor, MCIA GIS and Regional Analysts, other experts as deemed by MCIA, and the COTR to review and assess process methodology, tasking progress, results, and work plans.

5.2 Security Requirement:  Security clearances consistent with access to riverine websites on Intelink as well as access to Intelligence Community facilities and SCIFs are required in order to maximize performance.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking an innovative approach to measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) that will be responsive to the needs of researchers in a variety of neurological disorders and settings, with a particular emphasis on measuring outcomes in clinical trials.  Many of the traditional clinical or functional measures of disease status, such as tests of muscle strength or counts of seizure frequency, do not adequately represent the full scope of the impact of disease on an individual of chronic neurological disorders and their treatments.  More subjective aspects of patients’ functioning, such as social, psychological, and mental well-being, may be more important components of a disease intervention.  Measurement of patient-oriented outcomes is a particular concern in clinical trials, where differences in clinical measurements or imaging results may not translate into important benefit to the patients.  Some aspects of health-related quality of life have been incorporated into many recent or current clinical trials in neurology, usually as secondary outcome measures.  Many measurement scales have been developed for use in various disease settings; however, some of the existing scales have questionable validity and there is no consensus on what HRQL assessment methods should be used within or across studies or disease areas.  Because of the lack of consensus about the best tools or measurement approaches, it is not possible to compare the relative burden of various neurological conditions to each other or to non-neurological diseases; nor is it possible to compare the relative benefits of one treatment over another based on the same patient-centered outcome.  Investigators are reluctant to design trials with the primary objective of comparing quality of life, presumably because these outcomes appear to be too subjective, too hard to define concisely, too complex to administer, and too difficult to interpret.  There is a paucity of condition-targeted quality of life surveys for persons with neurological diseases that are reliable, valid, responsive, and are brief enough to be feasibly administered in a clinical trials setting.  The availability of such a tool for persons with neurological diseases would greatly increase the probability that the research community would incorporate patient-centered measures as primary and secondary outcomes in clinical trials.  The overall objective of the planned contract is to develop a psychometrically robust HRQL measurement tool that is accepted by the neurology clinical trials and clinical research communities.   Specific goals of the contract are as follows:  1) To develop a core set of questions that will address dimensions of HRQL that are universal to patients with chronic neurological disease; and 2) To develop supplemental questions or modules that address additional concerns that are specific to particular groups of patients defined by disease, age, or other factor.  The contract will be structured in two phases.  The first phase will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of instrument(s).  The second phase addresses the formal testing and refining of the final instrument(s).   It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five years and could be made on or about December 2003.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-03-04 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS EPA is soliciting proposals under full and open competition for "Health and Environmental Assesment Support for Regulated and Potentially Regulated Chemicals Released into the Environment," in support of the Office of Environmental Information (OEI), Analytical Support Branch (ASB). OEI's mission is to supply scientific support to meet EPA's regulatory mission, including ASB's work with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). EPCRA requires the collection of data on releases and transfers of certain toxic chemicals from industrial facilities, and to make this data available to the public on the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). Under the Pollution Prevention Act additional data are now required, including information on waste management and source reduction activities. ASB provides the scientific support for the development of TRI regulations and technical guidance documents, and responses to chemical petitions. ASB requires access to a broad range of expertise in order to support the regulatory activities of TRI.

<DESC>The Aerospace Propulsion Division (AFRL/PRA) of the Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PR) is paving the way for the next generation of high speed air-breathing vehicles and combined cycle - access to space vehicles. To achieve this end, we are looking for industry partner(s) to research, develop and test innovative design(s) for scramjet inlet, isolators, combustor, fuel injectors, and nozzle, i.e., engine flowpath. The overall arching Robust Scramjet program will develop, integrate and demonstrate various technologies necessary to establish the technology base for second generation liquid hydrocarbon and H2 fueled scramjet propulsion system concepts suitable for a potential follow-on flight-weight engine demonstration program. The Statement of Objectives for this contract is divided into three distinct areas .The first area requires industrial partners to address the fundamental issues associated with scramjet engine operability and expanding the Mach number capability to Mach 3-8+ for hydrocarbon fuel. Offerors are encouraged to use their expertise to increase the understanding in this area and to develop methods and schemes (computational and experimental) that would give as wide an operability range as possible and still meet the goals and objectives set by AFRL engineers and scientists. The contractor shall define the tasks and propose the approach to completing them. The contractor shall address how his approach fits in the overall picture and how it can be modified with minimum changes to adapt to the inlet, isolator, combustor, and nozzle. These components could have various geometries to include, square-rectangular and round-elliptical cross-sections. Scaling capability is an essential element of the modeling approach. The work should focus on designs for expendable missile applications. However, it is expected that the contractor offers and demonstrates the methodology capable of carrying the design to HC and finally H2 (or other fuel) reusable vehicle applications. The modeling/design effort should consider variable geometry inlets, which may be required to increase performance, improve operability and provide the capability to lower the Mach number for scramjet take-over to 3.0-. The long-term objectives being 1) improved performance and operability of hydrocarbon and H2-fueled scramjets 2) the ability to repeatedly cold start a scramjet engine in flight. The second area requires industrial partners to address the fundamental issues associated with enhancing engine durability for the HC expendable hypersonic cruise missile application and reusable engine structures for the affordable on-demand space access and long range intel/strike/recce aerospace vehicle. Offerors are encouraged to consider the use of existing flight-weight structures and materials for required performance and operability. New materials are to be developed and fabrication methods are to be identified where and when necessary. When feasible, subscale hardware are to be designed and fabricated to assess component operability and durability to reduce program risks. Structural durability will be increased from minutes, for single use applications, to hours for reusable systems. This technology is to be demonstrated in future tests of subscale inlet/isolators, sub- or full-scale direct connect isolator/combustors, and in semi-free or free-jet facilities. Post test analysis will be conducted to verify and validate design methodologies and design improvements and lessons learned will be incorporated. High-fidelity analytical tools will be employed to leverage experimental efforts and provide guidance for defining requirements for subsequent flight testing. The third area requires industrial partners to address the fundamental issues associated with scalability issues for the three classes of proposed vehicles such as the HC expendable hypersonic cruise missile, the space access, and the long range intel/strike/recce aerospace vehicles. Offerors are encouraged to use their innovative ideas and expertise to increase the understanding in this area. In order to develop scramjet scaling tools and methodologies, one will need to investigate and evaluate all aspects of scramjet flowpath, including novel injection schemes for enhanced mixing and high combustion efficiencies. Alternative engine cross sections are to be addressed to improve engine scaling while maintaining a wide range of operability, high performance, and structural integrity. High-fidelity analytical tools will be employed to leverage experimental efforts and provide guidance for defining requirements for subsequent flight testing. System and vehicle design studies performed by AFRL/PRA shall be used to guide the propulsion system design and engine/airframe integration wherever applicable.Proposal shall contain a description of the overall program as envisioned by the bidders and detailed information on one or more of the following three Delivery Orders: (1)  Scramjet Flowpath Integration, (2)  Component Technology Development,  and(3)  Advanced Concepts.  It is anticipated that the results of this effort directly feed to future technology programs such as Combined Cycle Engines.

This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BBWI or the DOE.  This solicitation for expressions of interest will close to response 30 days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company to: Gary W. Smith, Sr. Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BBWI, P. O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805.  E-mail is smitgw@inel.gov.  A description of the technology follows. 


Environmental contamination has occurred throughout the world as a result various operations.  For example, waste disposal at the INEEL and other DOE sites requires environmental remediation.  One option is to contain this contamination.  However, containment techniques for subsurface contamination have not been adequately demonstrated to satisfy regulatory concerns.  INEEL has developed an advanced subsurface containment system.  This system requires micro-tunneling capabilities not found within DOE.  Geological, hydrological and operation constraints need to be refined for system implementation.  INEEL is seeking partners with micro-tunneling experience in hard rock geology including granite, basalt, cobbles, rubble and sand filled fissures.  INEEL desires to enter into a CRADA with an industrial partner in order to further refine operations constraints and the installation tooling. Contact:  Mr Gary Smith smitgw@inel.gov

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>CORRECTION: This action originally publicized in the FEDBIZOPPS dated 4/18/2003 is to change the scope of work that should read as follow: This is not a Software Development. The VA Boston Healthcare System, 150 South Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02310, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with DATALABS for the acquisition of a Clinical Trial Management Software application which includes 50 software licenses, tele-forms integration tool, implementation, service, support and training. The requirements include a database capable of handling data from large multi-site studies, a management application capable of performing all core clinical trial activities, a data acquisition module that will allow for both remote data capture (internet or client-server) and paper form data capture and a system with sufficient flexibility to fulfill the needs of both MAVERIC functions. This application needs to have a proven track record. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation or a request for offers. No solicitation package is available. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. (Change response date to 5/12/2003).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. NCI-RFQ-30042-NV will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-13.  It is anticipated that two awards will be made from this solicitation.  

The North American Industrial Code is 541380 and the business size standard is 6M.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses. 

Background:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) proposes to enter into a agreement  with two laboratories to use serological methods to study the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), in a study entitled, “SV40 and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: a case control study.” 

SV40 was an inadvertent contaminant of poliovirus vaccines widely administered in 1955-62 in the U.S. Of concern, SV40 causes a variety of tumors when injected into newborn laboratory animals, including brain tumors, mesotheliomas, osteosarcomas, and notably, NHL. The possibility that SV40 infections, arising through vaccinations or other routes, cause a substantial fraction of NHLs was recently raised by two U.S. reports, describing the detection of SV40 DNA in 33-50% of NHLs (1,2).

Recent work has demonstrated the value of virus-like particle (VLP) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of SV40 infection in humans. Specifically, a recent publication documented the sensitivity and specificity of an SV40 VLP assay for detection of SV40 infection (3). The EIA format is particularly appropriate for epidemiological studies, since it can be performed inexpensively on a large scale, using small volumes of sera. Similar VLP EIAs for the human polyomaviruses BK and JC allow for the evaluation of cross-reactive antibodies in the same serum samples. An SV40 VLP EIA was used in a study of NHL in Spain (4).

NCI will study the association between SV40 and NHL, by measuring SV40 antibodies in subjects from the NCI-SEER Case-Control Study of NHL. This case-control study includes serum on approximately 800 HIV-uninfected NHL cases and 700 age-matched HIV-uninfected population controls. This study will be the first U.S. population-based case-control study of SV40 and NHL. NCI proposes to perform this testing using VLP EIAs for SV40, BK, and JC viruses. NCI seeks two independent laboratories to perform this testing, in order to compare the consistency of results between laboratories.

Base Requirement:

The purpose of this study is to compare SV40 antibody prevalence in NHL cases and controls. 

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, materials, and facilities as needed to perform this requirement.  Serum samples will be supplied by the NCI.

Contract Requirements:

1. The contractor shall perform VLP enzyme immunoassay measurements on 1500 serum samples from NHL cases and control. The contractor will perform VLP measurements separately for the three polyomaviruses SV40, BK, and JC. All samples will be tested in duplicate, and samples demonstrating coefficients of variation greater than 20% will be repeated. 
2. The contractor shall send to NCI the results of these tests in electronic format (Excel file or text file), along with the results of negative and positive controls from the corresponding assay runs. Results will consist of the individual optical density readings from the enzyme immunoassay runs and a score of each result as positive or negative.
3. The contractor shall send an invoice to NCI, specifying the samples tested and tests performed.

Reporting Requirements and Deliveries:

Study 1 of 2: due 6 weeks from start of order - Pilot study results. NCI will randomly select 300 sera from NHL cases and controls and include an additional four sera from SV40-positive monkeys as positive controls. The contractor shall perform SV40 VLP enzyme immunoassay testing in duplicate on these samples.
Deliverable: SV40 VLP enzyme immunoassay results for these samples, in electronic format (Excel file or text file), to be sent by email to NCI.

Study 2 of 2: due 5 months from start of order - Main study results. The contractor shall perform SV40 enzyme immunoassay testing on the remaining 1200 cases and controls, in duplicate. The contractor shall perform BK and JC enzyme immunoassay testing on all 1500 cases and controls, in duplicate.
Deliverable: Enzyme immunoassay results as specified, in electronic format (Excel file or text file), to be sent by email to NCI.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #0001 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: Question: RFQ specifies Distance Learning (DL) to supplement instruction  within a course:  Are DL only courses requested, or even permitted? Answer:DL may be used to supplement within a course, or as a course, if the course is part of the program.  For example, if they are offering a course in designing DL courses, and want to use DL as the instructional platform, that would be permissible.  Several of the courses already completed had a DL component.  We are NOT looking for an entire sequence of courses offered only on-line; our instructors teach primarily in a traditional, face-to-face format by nature of our residential Academy and having an entire on-line program would not meet the needs of the Academy. So OK for supplement, OK for a course or two, but not OK for an entire program on line. Question: RFQ refers to multi-layered program - what are the layers? Answer: a. Credit courses/program for the cohort. b. Specialized training and conferences (More guidance available?) c. Active research. Those are the layers.  A specialized training or conference might be a three-day conference here at the Academy with a very specialized, intense agenda that fulfilled an entire course requirement in three days perhaps supplemented by other out of class activities.  Active research would be courses such as practicum requirements, where learners study a program or problem here at the Academy under the director of their advisor, and conduct and report research results (sorta independent study/research). Question: Have students used above courses toward previous degree? Answer: All four courses were used toward the master's degree. Question: If student has taken two Foundations courses through FBI post-graduate development program, is it expected those courses will count toward nine minimum Foundations hours or would student take a full nine hours? Answer: Completed courses will count toward the 9 minimum Foundation hours. Question: With respect to the Electives, are the 12 total hours in addition to 72 hours in the Foundations, Practice, Research, Research project, and Cognate areas? Answer: There is a total of 72 hours in electives, foundations, practice, research and cognate. The FBI interprets electives as part of the cognate area, and this allows for learners to develop individual areas of concentration and/or interest depending on the area in which they teach.  For example, we have instructors who teach cyber crime investigations.  They have a greater need for computer instruction classes than let's say an instructor who designs large curriculum programs.  The idea is to take the already completed 36 hours, spread those hours across concentrations in foundations, practice, research and cognate, and then for the students to complete additional courses in each area for a well-rounded post masters course of study, rather than concentrating post masters study in just one area. The research project (dissertation like work) is another chunk and that would vary depending on what the requirements are for the institution to award a degree.  Some require up to another 30 hours, and some have lesser number of hours.  (I hope this isn't confusing, but it depends on the requirements of the individual academic institution). Question: Is total program minimum 84 hours? Answer: It is 72 hours plus the institution's requirement amount of hours for research project (dissertation like work).  Some of the institutions in Virginia require as many as 30 additional hours.  This is a little opened ended because some students and their projects take longer than other students and their respective projects. Question: Regarding cost proposal, do travel and materials pertain only to university faculty and staff? Answer: Travel and materials are for university faculty and staff, again emphasizing we have a fully functional facility here at the Academy which can be used at a substantial savings (i.e, dormitories, classrooms and the like). Question: The RFQ states that a measurable percentage of relevant coursework should be taught either at the beginning or the end (evenings) of the workday. Will the students also be able to attend classes on the weekends? Are weeknights preferable to weekends? Answer: Students are able to attend classes on the weekends and in the evenings. Because of the teaching and program administrative requirements, students cannot attend classes during normal work hours (8-5), hence the preference for evening classes. Question: The RFQ states that the program should include active participation by university faculty and post-graduate students in collaborative basic and applied research with the FBI and that this collaboration could include regular on-site visits (both university and FBI Academy) to work on research projects. How long at one time can students be away from their jobs to spend time on campus? Answer: Some students, because of their regular teaching responsibilities, could only travel away from the Academy during breaks between class sessions.  If they teach in the National Academy program, there are two or three week breaks between each 12-week session, which would allow for time to be spent on campus.  Other students, especially those who teach in the New Agent training program, don't get a regular break where there are no classes, and trips to campus would have to be arranged around each of those students' schedule.  Asking the entire cohort, to attend a two-week summer session for example, would be extremely difficult given work assignments. Question: If campus visits are part of the program, should all of the travel-related costs for the students be built into the budget (air fare, lodging, per diem, etc.)? Answer: Student travel costs would be paid for out of the travel budget allocated to the FBI Academy. Question: Will the government look favorably upon appendices that provide supporting data to give the evaluators additional information on which to make decisions regarding technical merit and past performance should they need it (e.g., summaries of past performance, faculty biosketches)? Answer: Information regarding technical merit and past performance, to include course descriptions, summations, faculty bios, catalogs, or even on-line descriptions are encouraged and would be appreciated by the evaluation team. Question:  If the tuition rate is built on eight students, the tuition will be much higher than if it is built on a larger cohort.  Can offerors submit more than one budget to indicate what the tuition rate would be if the cohort is comprised of more students (e.g., of 10, 12, 15, etc.)? Answer: More than one budget also is encouraged. Once an agreed-upon program is designed, the FBI will publicize the program which may enhance the size of the cohort. The DEA, for example, has several interested students, but until the program is agreed-upon, DEA will not approve participation. The same is true for other entities such as CIA and Department of Homeland Security. Question: What is the time frame for the first class to be conducted? Answer: Classes will start at a mutually agreed upon time. The FBI Academy projects classes starting in either September or January, 2004. Question: Is there already a pool of prospective applicants who are likely to meet admission requirements?  Answer: There is a pool of prospective applicants who are likely to meet admission requirements. Some of the pool completed master's level work in 1999, some in 2002 and some will complete their work in December, 2003 (hence the January, 2004 possible start date). Question: Will the FBI advertise the program throughout its agencies and other agencies or will the contractor be responsible for soliciting applicants? Answer:  The FBI will advertise the program and solicit applicants. Participants should be involved in the essential training mission of the FBI rather than just be interested in purusing additional education at Government expense. 17.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) number 042898.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 611430.  The Business Size Standard for this solicitation is $5 million.   The term of this contract shall be for one year from date of award.  The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement for a firm fixed-price contract for one year with four (4), one-year options for the acquisition of the following services:  Accredited university post-masters program in education, adult learning or human resource development, interdisciplinary studies and other academic disciplines which provide and support an array of relevant course offerings which relate to the mission, responsibilities, requirements and needs of the FBI;  Academic programs which are flexible enough to provide a strong formal education structure, but can accommodate an orientation toward the adult learner;  Course offerings and consultative services within or between university departments than can lead to a terminal degree, should the individual student participant so desire;  A measurable percentage of relevant course work which is taught either at the beginning or end (evenings) of the workday.  Additionally, it would be desirable for respondents to offer a maximum degree of flexibility in course scheduling.  Distance learning methods can be used to supplement instruction within a course.  University submitting a proposal must have a permanent teaching facilities located within fifty miles of Washington, D.C., or be willing to conduct classes at the FBI Academy, and possibly establish a presence at the FBI Academy. The FBI will provide all necessary classroom facilities and Audio Visual (AV) equipment for classes conducted at the FBI Academy.  Partnerships or consortium arrangements among universities are strongly encouraged. Appointment of appropriately credentialed FBI personnel as Adjunct faculty, for the purpose of course planning and execution, research and development or participation in other university programs.  Where appropriate, courses could be developed and conducted jointly to take advantage of both university and FBI expertise and facilities.  All students should be charged the same rate of tuition regardless of the state or district where they reside.  Collaboration by university and FBI personnel to develop "short" (compressed time) courses, specialized training and conferences which address emerging or as yet un-addressed requirements and needs of the national and international law enforcement training and education community. Active participation by university faculty and post-graduate students in collaborative basic and applied research with the FBI. When research is assigned or agreed to by a faculty member and/or post-graduate student, FBI staff will participate actively in that program for its duration, to include membership on the student research committee. The collaboration could include regular on-site visits (both university and FBI Academy) to work on research projects.  It should be the intention of both parties to encourage joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  Willingness of the universities to meet all of the above to engineer and maintain strategic partnerships to achieve a multi-layered program. In your response to this Request for Proposals, the offeror shall also submit to the FBI the following information:  Course descriptions, titles and numbers contained in the university/college catalog;  Requirements for the relevant degree program, including prerequisite and graduation requirements; and, Policy regarding acceptance of course credits from other universities. The guaranteed minimum under this contract will be one class of eight students.  Description and program specifics:  The FBI seeks a sequence of courses and milestones that can be identified as a block of courses, to include preliminary exams and timetable for coordinating published research.  Standard admissions process - proposal must include admission process requirements.  The FBI anticipates the course work will center on these four areas:  Foundations - A minimum of three courses in foundations, including topics such as Informal Learning in the Workplace, The Programming Process in Adult Learning, History of Adult Education, Individual and Organizational Development, Philosophical Foundations of Human Resource Development, and Adult Learning.  FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Informal Learning in the Workplace and The Adult Learner (syllabi for these two courses are available upon request).  These additional courses build on the instruction already provided in the area of adult learning.  Having a professional competence in the area of adult learning is critical both to the mission of the FBI and to the design and delivery of curriculum consistent with the latest advances in the educational community.  Generally, the area of foundations addresses the broader historical, philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of adult education and human resource development.  Practice - A minimum of three courses in practice, including topics such as Consulting With Human Systems, Small Groups in Adult Learning, Facilitating Adult Learning, and Instructional Systems Design.    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Instructional Systems Design (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These two additional courses reinforce the provided instruction and further develop the professional instructor competence in small group learning in adults and in human systems.  Generally, the area of practice addresses applications of models and theoretical perspectives of engagement of individuals and other human systems.  Research - A minimum of fifteen (15) hours of statistics and research methods courses are required.  These courses address topics including but not limited to:  qualitative methods and quantitative methods (advanced statistics/regression and program evaluation research methods).    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have one course in Educational Research (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These research and statistics courses are extremely important to develop a professional research component at the Academy in the short-term, and the University in the long-term.  The research capacity must be developed in a manner that conforms with academic standards, so that results are published, defended and accepted within the academic community.   Generally, the area of research addresses research methods, qualitative and quantitative, including statistical concepts and other tools of inquiry.  In addition to the formal course work in the area of research, the FBI requires its post-graduate students to collaborate on projects demonstrating basic and applied research in addressing critical issues within the FBI.   The research will focus on problems identified and research supported, at least in part, by the FBI.  It is the FBI's intention to encourage an inter-locking research agenda, so that post-graduate students participate joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  The FBI estimates this coordinated research effort, which meets the academic equivalent of a published dissertation, to take approximately 30 hours of credit course work, supervised by a faculty committee.  Topics for this coordinated research agenda would be approved by the Assistant Director, Training Division, and by the supervising faculty committee.  Cognate - A minimum of three courses in a "cognate." The FBI desires to assemble some of the course work for this cognate from other courses participating students completed during graduate level course work.  Generally, the area of a cognate represents an area of specialization representing course work relating to a specific academic discipline or specific practice area.  Cognate areas which directly relate to the mission of the FBI include:  distance learning, human development, management science, organizational behavior, curriculum and instruction, knowledge management, and educational administration.  Other cognate areas may be added to this long-term development plan by the FBI, based on the needs of the FBI.  In the event a responding institution has a cognate area that is believed to relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning, respondents are requested to identify the area and the courses which comprise the cognate.  Some of these courses are referred to as "electives," for a total of 12 hours, six of which must be completed in the post-graduate work.  Six of the hours can be carried over from course work completed by the students during graduate level study.  Again, the courses in the electives phase will relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning or organizational development issues.  Professional competence in these areas is essential to fulfill the mission of the FBI and to realize the full potential of the new University.  When matters of research or study contain sensitive information the FBI Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will be required to approve release of this information.  It is proposed that students will start, and finish, at the same time.  Students will carry either 9 or 6 credits each semester.  The course of study may extend from the base year through options years.  The COTR will work with the selected vendor to identify the courses and their sequence. Participation in this program will be allowed to other Federal Government Agencies authorized by the FBI.  All quotes shall be submitted to the address listed below no later than 3:00 PM, EST, May 8, 2003.  Quotes shall be clearly marked RFQ 042898.  No hand-carried or faxed packages will be considered.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis for the F-16 Head Up Display (HUD) Electronics Unit (EU) Request for Information

This announcement constitutes a request for information.  The Air Force plans to use performance based procedures to replace the existing Head-Up Display (HUD) Electronics Unit (EU) with a more reliable, longer life HUD EU that carries a warranty and has a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5,000 hours.  This procurement will use performance based acquisition specifications vice build-to-print requirements.  This procurement will be based on “best value” contracting, not necessarily lowest initial procurement cost.  The HUD EU will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function, and interface equivalence.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in producing a high reliability HUD EU using modern technology rather than traditional build-to-print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for approximately 680 units.  The new HUD EU will replace the legacy HUD EU.  There are currently three operational versions of the HUD EU (NSN 1270-01-503-3099, P/N 51-036-10-94A; NSN 1270-01-480-8609, P/N 51-036-10-93A; and NSN 1270-01-473-8883, P/N 51-036-10-92C).

Interested parties are requested to submit a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the new HUD EU.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first production article delivery are also solicited to assist in the budgeting process.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  Please limit your response to twenty (20) pages.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished.  The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be submitted by 29 May 2003 to dale.kirtley@hill.af.mil.  No telephone or fax responses will be accepted.  A top-level drawing set describing the legacy HUD EU is available at the FedTeDS.gov web site; follow the “Technical Data Package” link associated with this synopsis.  The Theory of Operations, Statement of Objectives, Performance Based Acquisition Specification, and the Test Plan are available at the Hill AFB business opportunities web site; follow the “Important Link to current information” link associated with this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>10--UNDERSEA WEAPONS SYSTEMS PRODUCTION (MARKET RESEARCH
<SOLNBR>MarketRsrch
<CONTACT>William Randolph 202-781-3918
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) provides the following information for the purpose of obtaining market research on the current undersea weapons production industry.  This action is not a formal, or precursor to a formal, Request For Proposal (RFP). The information contained herein as well as the anticipated industry responses are for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Anticipated responses to this announcement are sought to identify industry sources that believe they have the comprehensive knowledge, facilities, skills, and capacity to meet the Navy’s overall requirement for implementing a proposed consolidated production program. This program will acquire a full spectrum of torpedo weapons, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) targets, and major subsystems to support acquisition objectives and Warfighter needs throughout the United States Navy, Department of Defense and possible Joint Programs and/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS). This action is also an opportunity for industry to provide comment on the feasibility of the contemplated consolidated production program. The USN is modernizing its inventory of undersea weapons and ASW targets.  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (E&MD) programs are maturing significant performance capabilities for the MK54 Lightweight Mod 0 torpedo, the MK48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Mod 6 and 7 torpedo, and the MK30 Mod 2 ASW target.  All of these systems will continue to be enhanced via spiral development programs, which will ultimately feed into planned procurements.  The U.S. Navy has not procured ‘all-up-rounds’ or entire torpedo assemblies since the mid 1990’s.  Today, torpedo production takes the form of systems integration of upgrades that replace obsolescing hardware and introduces advanced technologies enabled  capabilities to the torpedo inventory.  This is currently accomplished through a process involving both an industry prime contractor and an organic Navy torpedo depot.  Due to the uniqueness of torpedoes and the low volume of production, the Navy envisions a single prime production supplier who can work synergistically with the Navy torpedo depot to efficiently and cost effectively produce these end items.  The existing schedule demand to deliver torpedoes and ASW target capabilities precludes strong Navy interest in any significant production start-up effort. However, the opportunity for start-up effort does exist in feeder technology and systems development projects for such aspects as the Torpedo Advanced Processing Build  (APB) process.  Furthermore, the Navy consistently promotes lowering barriers to entry for industry partners and encourages competition of subvendors to t he prime production vendor for parts and sub-assemblies. By examining the anticipated effects of product line consolidation on the undersea weapons production industry, we desire to gather data that can be useful in creating an appropriate acquisition strategy. The Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404) is seeking to identify likely prime and subsystem sources for the production and delivery of MK48 ADCAP, MK54, and MK30 Mod 2 end items as it examines the feasibility of consolidating several hardware production contracts.  The results of this market research will assist NAVSEA in creating an appropriate acquisition strategy that is reflective of the current undersea weapons systems production environment. It is NAVSEA’s intent to use this data in the process of solidifying an acquisition strategy and to initiate an associated procurement process for future (as early as FY04)  consolidated torpedo hardware requirements. Regardless of the information received, the goals of the resulting strategy and procurement vehicle(s), when materialized, will be: 1) responsiveness to Fleet inventory needs for the identified end items, 2) the sustainability of a skilled torpedo and ASW target workforce, 3) the achievement of significant production process improvements, 4) the achievement of substantial component commonality across product lines and 5) considerable procurement and life cycle costs savings. In accordance with all information residing in the public domain for the identified production end items, respondents are asked to adequately demonstrate their current capability and capacity to produce either the entire end item(s) or major subsystems. The demonstration of capability and capacity should be described in the following areas: (1) weapons systems int egration and production testing; (2) personnel – experienced personnel with satisfactory qualifications to execute production of end items to meet technical, performance, and test specifications; (3) facilities – existing facilities to support the integration and delivery of prime and major subsystems, leveraging dedicated Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) available facilities as necessary, to minimize time required to deliver Fleet capability and time during which Fleet assets are inducted for upgrade; (4) capital equipment – demonstrate commitment to design and/or purchase of production and test capabilities to maintain Fleet delivery schedules; (5) processes -  effective production systems, materials management, access to parts suppliers as required, and viable subcontracting relationships or teaming concepts as required; (6) technology – ability to address electronic and  mechanical technology obsolescence and advance state-of-the-art hardware and software components at the prime and/or major subsystem levels; and 7) perceived effects of consolidation – a survey of the effects of product line consolidation on the undersea weapons production industry, competition, commonality, efficiencies, etc.  Again, the information gathered as a result of this market research may be used to prepare an acquisition strategy for a consolidated undersea weapons production contract vehicle. As such, supportable and verifiable responses are expected that are unclassified in content and non-proprietary in nature. Prime contractors and major subsystem contractors having the required specialized capabilities to address the above criteria (1 through 7) should submit a capability statement of eight (8) pages (11 point minimum) or less indicating the ability to perform  all aspects of the effort described herein to: Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command ATTN: William C. Randolph, SEA 02611, 1333 Isaac Hull Ave, SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-0001. Any title pages, forwarding memorandums, pictures, tables, exhibits and reference material will be counted as part of the total page count. All responses shall be received on or before 21 May 2003. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the market research. The Government may request a further detailing of capabilities provided in individual responses to fully understand the market in general and specific individual capabilities identified. Respondents, however, are under no obligation to participate. Other than the information provided herein, no other information or supporting documentation in regards to this industry assessment exists. All responders should be holders of active Secr et Facility Clearances as it will be a requirement of any follow-up procurement action, should one arise. All clarification requests and digital (e-mail) versions of submissions may be forwarded to: Mr. William C. Randolph via e-mail at randolphwc@navsea.navy.mil. This market research announcement is for information only.

For example, Dornier, a German company, produces a Virtual Reality SHORAD Trainer.  VR Trainers have been developed as direct replacements for systems such as those in use today by the Marine Corps LAAD.  VR Trainers employ the latest in technology allowing for the facilitation of realistic mission specific training scenarios that can be tailored for specific needs.  The selection of VR Trainers could provide t he LAAD community with critical operational and logistics advantages over the current use of dome training environments.  A system that has equivalent or better performance would be acceptable to the USMC LAAD.  The potential benefits of using the VR Trainer technology in the LAAD community would include both improved operational capability as well as a potential reduction of total ownership costs.  This capability would offer the USMC increased operational capabilities: tailored training scenarios supporting simultaneous missions, significantly improved capabilities through realistic training, and significantly reduced logistics costs.  Additionally, this capability could directly benefit the operating forces by reducing unit level costs associated with traveling to and from the training sites.  This self-contained portable system could potentially reduce the total ownership c ost of the training system.  Respondents should include in submittal the following: proposed approach, advantages, disadvantages, training requirements for users, ability by the Government to maintain item, timeline for development and delivery, and Rough Order of Magnitude of cost. Interested vendors should provide information along with technical questions regarding this announcement to Ryan Roberts via email at Roberts_ryan@crane.navy.mil or by fax to 812.854.1178 Attn. Ryan Roberts.  This notice does not constitute and Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. The Government is only seeking information for future needs.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  The Government will not reimburse any costs incurred by interested companies responding to this announcement. All informatio n marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.

<SUBJECT>A -- NINDS PILOT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK
<SOLNBR>NOT-03-008

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking information that may be used to help develop specifications for a network for pilot clinical trials and those organizations that might be capabilities to conduct such an effort.  NINDS is seeking input about the technical expertise required and available to create and operate an efficient network, as well as input into its specific structure.          

Background:       

Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in potential pharmacological interventions for neurological diseases that require testing in clinical trials.  NINDS is supporting initiatives for drug screening and pre-clinical testing (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-139.html).  However, many interventions may never reach early phase clinical trials.  There are several barriers to entry for pilot clinical trials, including issues of competing interventions, infrastructure and funding, access to patient populations, lack of experienced clinical investigators, and inadequate communication between pre-clinical and clinical researchers.  The goal of this project is to ensure that potential treatments are tested in pilot clinical trials in a timely and efficient way by developing a network of sites and a coordinating center that could implement trials for different neurological diseases.  The trials conducted by this network would be studies that are needed to determine if further clinical testing of the intervention is warranted.  The proposed network will be a resource for investigators to test promising new agents that result from pre-clinical translational research efforts. 
          
The overall objective of the network is to facilitate the timely transition from pre-clinical to clinical studies.  Within the network, hundreds of academic-based and practice-based centers would be pre-qualified, based on simple criteria, to participate in pilot trials for one or more diseases.  The goal is to have broad participation and representation of different populations and diseases to limit the barriers for sites to enter the network.  New sites would be invited to apply to be added to the network at regular intervals.  Sites would be maintained in the network at minimal cost, then compete to participate in specific fully funded studies as the need arises.  Each year, the network will potentially start two or more pilot studies.  There will be a single coordinating center that will work with investigators to develop protocols, consent documents and case report forms, facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements, train and monitor study sites, and perform data management and analysis, and coordinate all aspects of the network.  It is anticipated that the network will perform studies in disease areas in which few if any previous clinical trials have been performed.  Thus, substantial flexibility and intellectual leadership – clinical and statistical – will be required on the part of the coordinating center.  The selection of particular interventions for study will be performed by a steering committee comprised of NIH staff and scientists independent of the centers in the network.  Participation in the network will not replace existing grants or contracts to perform clinical studies, nor should it discourage independent investigators or existing networks or cooperative groups from applying for funding.  The network will expedite clinical testing for select, high priority agents and provide clinical trials infrastructure where needed.
          
The major aims of the network are:          

1.	to facilitate the transfer of pre-clinical research results to clinical trials.     
2.	to minimize the cost of the infrastructure by building a network for several disease areas.     
3.	to make study of rare neurological diseases economically feasible.     
4.	to expedite recruitment of subjects.     
5.	to involve a wide spectrum of investigators.     
6.	to recruit a broad range of participants, particularly minorities.     
7.	to make participation in NINDS clinical research more accessible to patients.     
       
These aims must be achieved while maintaining the highest ethical standards in human subject research, setting a benchmark for the entire neurology research community.          

Information Requested:     

Information in the areas listed below will aid in the design of a solicitation to establish and operate the network.  We request that interested organizations identify their technical expertise and resources, and capabilities and describe their availability to conduct such an endeavor.      

1.	Design and structure of the network:  

a.	What are the major essential components of the network?  What expertise, capabilities, and levels of effort are required for each of the network centers and for the coordinating center?     
b.	Should the network included centers capable of performing phase I studies in healthy subjects?     
c.	What are the barriers to participation of neurological disease treatment centers in this endeavor?     
d.	What steps (or phases) are necessary for initiation of the network?  What is the proposed timeline?     
e.	What should the criteria be for selecting treatments to be studied in this network and how should this selection process be organized?     
f.	How can outreach and recruitment of children, women, and minority participants be implemented?     
g.	How can outreach and recruitment of uncommon disease populations be implemented?     
h.	What low-cost effort would sustain the capability of centers in the network to compete for the opportunity to participate in studies when the opportunity arises?     
i.	Only a small fraction of centers would ever participate in any trials.  What benefits would there be for the network centers that do not successfully compete to participate in trials sponsored by NINDS?             

2.	Subcontract Award and Management:     

The pilot trial network may involve hundreds of investigators funded through small awards issued by the contractor as subcontracts.  Describe the personnel and database requirements associated with awarding and managing multiple subcontracts, including quality control procedures, and research support services.     

3.	Program Management and Evaluation:     

Initiating the network will be a complex and multifaceted process.  The contractor will additionally be required to evaluate the progress of the subcontracted research and of the efficiency of the network.      

a.	Describe your experience with strategic planning and initiation of comparably complex projects.     

b.	Describe the technical, medical, and clinical methodological expertise that you possess that is necessary for the design, operation, and maintenance for the network.     

c.	Describe how you would evaluate the overall performance of the network at each stage of its development.     

d.	Describe your resources for organizing training and planning sessions for the investigators.     

4.	Personnel:     

For the following, assume that at any time several hundred network centers would be qualified in one or more disease areas and that one or two 30-100 patient early to middle development studies would be started per year, each study to last 2 years or less.  The number of centers to participate would vary widely depending on the scarcity of patients.  The costs at each center would have to vary based on the number of patients they could be expected to provide.  

Provide an assessment of the number and mix of personnel required to create and operate the network and the approximate level of effort required, broken down by its major components.  

This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information.

<SUBJECT>Burial Ground Remedial Design Technical Workshop Vendor Survey
<DESC>REMEDIATION OF HANFORD WASTE BURIAL GROUNDS, POC: Christina Richmond, 206-269-5041, Fax 206-269-5046, email: crichmond@enviroissues.com Workshop poster session on potential technologies for remediation of 618-10/-11 burial grounds containing unsegregated transuranic-contaminated radiological and hazardous materials. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT:  .  The purpose of this  special notice is to gain knowledge of potential technologies for remediation of the 618-10/-11 burial grounds at the U.S. Department of Energy?s Hanford site at Richland, WA.  A limited number of firms that respond will be invited to present posters on their technologies at a remedial design technical workshop on June 9-12 in Richland, WA.  Interested firms should submit a response to the attached survey for technologies that might address unsegregated transuranic (TRU)-contaminated radiological and hazardous materials at Hanford?s 618-10 and 618-11 burial grounds and other similar DOE sites.  Technologies may address waste characterization, stabilization (for removal and handling), excavation, retrieval and segregation, treatment, packaging, transportation, and health and safety protection.  The 618-10 and 618-11 burial grounds were operated for disposal of pre-1970 generated TRU and low- to high-activity waste to support defense production of plutonium at the Hanford Site.  Documentation of materials placed in the burial grounds is incomplete, but high-activity fission products, low-level, and mixed low-level radioactive waste, plutonium, uranium, and other TRU wastes in various forms are known to have been placed into trenches, pipes and caissons at the waste sites.  Along with technical experts from a number of DOE sites, the workshop is designed to gather potential vendors with technologies that might address remediation of the 618-10/618-11 burial ground and similar issues at other DOE sites.  Much of the workshop will focus on sharing lessons learned and identifying issues and potential solutions for waste characterization, stabilization (for removal and handling), retrievability and segregation, excavation, treatment requirements, packaging and transportation, final disposal, health and safety issues, and compliance with regulatory requirements.  The poster session will take place on Monday, June 9th in the afternoon.  Space for vendors is limited, so interested firms must complete the table described below by May 9th and return it to [Christina Richmond with EnviroIssues at crichmond@enviroissues.com].  Up to 25 vendors that represent a wide range of characterization and excavation technologies will be selected for the poster session.  The U.S. Department of Energy ? Richland Operations Office and Fluor Hanford are not responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents for preparation and/or participation in this workshop and poster session.  Respondents understand that participation is voluntary and all costs incurred as a result are the responsibility of the respondents.  Also note that this vendor selection process will not prevent anyone from bidding on or participating in any subsequent procurement processes.  Participation in this workshop does not constitute award of any work for which proposals may be solicited in the future. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms submitting vendor surveys shall present their information in a table format for each technology.  The length of the submission shall be no more than one (1) page for each technology.

<SUBJECT>B -- Pipeline Safety Damage Prevention Grant Program
<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) solicits applications for the second round of damage prevention grants.  These grants are available to State agencies to fund projects that assist them in preventing damage to underground facilities.  Program and Project Funding in the amount of approximately $1,300,000 is available under this program for distribution among approved applications.  RSPA will consider a per-project, maximum Federal funding of $300,000 ($375,000 total project cost.  See section below on cost sharing.)  RSPA also will consider projects that exceed the $300,000 cap, if they have a broad benefit.  Applications must be received by June 13, 2003.  See section on Application Procedures for more information.  In general, projects should seek to implement a specific set of the best practices identified in the report, "Common Ground: Study of One-Call Systems and Damage Prevention Best Practices."  The "Common Ground" study, a list of its best practices, and other related information is available at the Office of Pipeline Safety Internet web page, http://ops.dot.gov/damage.htm.  Click on the "One-Call Systems Study - Damage Prevention Best Practices" choice. States may directly fund their servicing one-call notification systems, trade or industry associations, or other legally eligible entities in furtherance of the best practices found in "Common Ground". 
COST SHARING.  The recipient State agency must provide a minimum of 20 percent of the direct and indirect costs of all activities covered under the grant award project with non-Federal (cost share contribution) funds.  Recipients may either use cash, in-kind contributions, or a combination of both to meet this requirement.  In-kind contributions are in addition to the maintenance effort required of recipients of grant awards.  The types of cost sharing contributions allowed include:  (1) Any funds from a State, local, or other non-Federal source used for an eligible activity (see section below on Third-party support); (2) The dollar equivalent value of an eligible activity provided by a State, local, or other non-Federal source; (3) The value of participants' salary while attending an activity contained in the approved grant application, provided by a State, local, or other non-Federal source; and (4) Additional types of in-kind contributions, in accordance with 49 CFR Part 18, Section 18.24.  Third-party Support:  Other agencies or organizations can make contributions to help satisfy the State's Share.  Matching requirements may be met in the form of cash or properly valued, in-kind resources.  State appropriations, as well as funds or other resources made available for the conduct of the project by other organizations, trade associations, or other project participants, may be used to satisfy the matching requirement.  Funds from other Federal grants or programs cannot be used as the match for the damage prevention grant program.  REIMBURSEMENT AND ADVANCES.  In general, RSPA will reimburse the grantee for the Federal cost share.  That is, the grantee will make authorized expenditures supporting the approved grant project, then present bills and supporting records to RSPA for necessary review and approval, not more often than quarterly.  Funds used for matching purposes under any other Federal grant or cooperative agreement may not be used for matching purposes.  The funds expended by a recipient agency to qualify for the grant may not be used for cost-sharing purposes.  ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS. The requirements contained in 49 CFR part 18, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments," apply to grants and cost-sharing requirements contained by this program.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-87 "Cost Principles for State and Local Governments", A-102 "Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments", and A-133 "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations" also apply to these grants to States.  APPLICATION PROCEDURES.  Interested State agencies can apply for these grants using the Standard Form (SF)424 and SF-424A, Application for Federal Assistance for non-construction programs and budget sheets.  These forms are available for downloading at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) website http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/grants_forms.html.  Additional Information: Application packages must also contain the following:  (1) A description of the State's one-call notification program.

<SUBJECT>B -- Deployable/Mobile Hard Walled Shelter Technology
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on mobile hard-walled shelters that are easily deployable, preferably can be palletized for airlift, and can be used in a variety of missions.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of deployable/mobile hard walled shelter technology for an austere base type scenario.  This shelter would preferably be palletized and expandable into a variety of sizes.  This shelter would serve as a replacement or alternative to the current TEMPER tent system representing a cost and weight savings.  The shelter will have no less than a minimum of 640 square feet and weigh no more than 10,000 pounds.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.
The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce and certify an operational item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating a composite type shelter that is expandable and easily deployable.  This shelter would have an infinite number of uses to include a repair shop, billeting, medical facility, offices, fitness facility, etc.  It shall fit in the confines of a 463L pallet or similar type mobility system.  The shelter would contain necessary beddown items to include cots, brooms, set-up tools, fire extinguishers, support electrical systems, etc.  It would require environmental control unit ports for heating and air conditioning systems.  The shelter would be easy and quick to set-up with standard tools.  While the structure would be superior compared to a soft-walled tent, it would need to be easily repairable with standard and locally procured items. Weight and the size of the shelter are primary factors.  Obviously a shelter that has the most amount of space for the least amount of weight providing a combined improved efficiency is preferred.  To clarify, this shelter is meant to be easily set-up and torn down in austere base scenarios, as an improvement or alternative in quality and flexibility to a soft walled tent.    

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN 2 June 2003 to Capt Jason Mitchell, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Capt Mitchell can be reached at (208) 828-3546.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate as a sample for an independent assessment.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The U.S. Air Force will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend
