<DESC>This is a research and development sources sought notice requesting information from Industry for assistance with the Missile Defense Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) efforts supporting the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or to otherwise pay for the submission of any information in response to this notice. Any response will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal. The release of this synopsis is to gain information on sources and capabilities.
<p>MDA is seeking industry partners to provide SE&amp;I services to work in concert with the Government's MDA Engineering team to plan, define, design, test, and assess the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The BMDS is an integrated, "layered" architecture that provides multiple opportunities to destroy missiles and their warheads before they can reach their targets. The system's architecture includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Integrated and networked sensors including space, ground, and sea-based platforms for target detection and tracking <br />&bull; Integrated Command and control, battle management, and communications including the weapon system fire control and networks providing the warfighter with the needed links between the sensors and interceptor missiles<br />&bull; Ground- and sea-based interceptor missiles for destroying a ballistic missile using<br />either the force of a direct collision, called "hit to kill" or kinetic technology, or an explosive blast fragmentation warhead</p>
<p>For additional information on the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) mission see: www.mda.mil.</p>
<p>MDA is requesting information on capabilities from interested companies on their expertise and innovative and efficient methods for conducting Systems Engineering and Integration for the BMDS. The response should include plans for how the companies would leverage industry's prime contractor expertise in the development and fielding of the BMDS components. In particular, MDA is soliciting capabilities of companies to support MDA for the capability development, system design, integration, verification, and assessment for the BMDS. This includes expertise in the following areas:</p>
<p>Area 1: BMDS Concept Development: Determine capability needs, architecture options, concept definition analysis of alternatives, concept requirements, and interface definition for evolution of the BMDS to address critical gaps to objective BMDS capabilities.</p>
<p>Area 2: System Design and Requirements: Develop detailed architecture, functional performance and integration requirements and design, driving development and integration of the BMDS.<br /><br />Area 3: Integration and Verification: Develop BMDS integration planning documentation driving SW/HW deliveries to support capability deliveries. Development of requirement verification plans to support the technical assessment providing the rationale supporting capability delivery decisions. Develop direction to the test community to ensure sufficient data is collected to enable Models &amp;Simulation Verification Validation &amp; Accreditation to support high confidence BMDS capability verification and assessment.</p>
<p>Area 4: Modeling and Simulation: Develop BMDS models and simulation requirements to enable accurate representation of the BMDS to support Ground Test (GT)/System Post Flight Reconstruction (SPFR) and Performance Assessments (PA) resulting in increased confidence in the assessment of the BMDS. <br /><br />Area 5: Innovative Team Approaches: Recommend logical and legal teaming approaches that may be innovative or non-traditional that you may select to efficiently develop, acquire, and sustain the BMDS effort. Discuss how you plan to participate in corporate relationships that may require access to proprietary data from other corporate or independent organizations approved to team with the government.</p>
<p>Area 6: System Engineering Processes: Discuss your understanding and approach to the capabilities-based systems engineering process. Capabilities-based system engineering processes must be highly collaborative between the system and subsystem levels. Discuss how your process relates to and efficiently integrates the corresponding phases of the systems engineering process. Discuss your organization's prior and current experience supporting Special Access Programs.</p>
<p>Area 7: Programmatic Reviews: Discuss your organization's history and capabilities participating in technical and programmatic meetings and working groups, Peer Reviews and Boards, as well as interactions with other DoD organizations.</p>
<p>Area 8: Points of Contact: List current or past Federal Government Points of Contact and contact information for Government organizations you have or had contracts requiring extensive experience in the development and implementation of capabilities-based system engineering processes and management.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor may propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams). The Government does not intend to impose restrictions on team membership after award, except as necessary to prevent Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues in accordance with FAR 9.5 between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts supporting MDA Engineering. In order to be considered for award, contractor personnel must be cleared at the SECRET level. A select number of contractor personnel must be eligible for TOP SECRET clearance.</p>
<p>Please submit your company's response encompassing capabilities for each of the eight (8) areas listed. You may include a statement of interest, qualifications, experience, expertise, products and any relevant corporate literature and product data. Please submit the information requested in the same order and using the same Area numbering scheme in this notice to facilitate review by the Government.</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any future formal Request for Proposal. Information received in response to this request may be used by the Missile Defense Agency for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. MDA will not critique the responses to this notice.

<DESC>NOTE:&nbsp; Responses due 2 May 2011, 4:00 pm CST.<br /><br />NOTE:&nbsp; There are no formatting requirements or page limits for responses to this RFI.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />AIR FORCE MEDICAL MODELING AND SIMULATION PROGRAM - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>This document shall serve as the overall parent document for the attached RFIs. It consists of five separate RFIs that will be used within the Air Force Medical Modeling and Simulation (AFMM&amp;S) Program's enterprise delivery of cutting-edge medical education and training. The competing missions of war, beneficiary care, homeland security, natural disaster and pandemic response training have put huge demands on the military medical service. Due to the dissimilar nature of civilian versus battlefield trauma and the low volume of cases, training opportunities fall short in offering adequate preparation for the management of battlefield trauma.<br /><br />The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) must bridge this gap with new technology that offers distributed training in virtual environments using medical gaming scenarios, and with synthetic tissue that mimics characteristics of live tissue and tissue tool surgery. These five RFIs are portions of an overarching knowledge management strategy. The AFMS will access web based technology leveraging a cloud computing strategy that will link medical gaming simulations and virtual environments hosted on Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certified server(s). Performance metrics will be created, tracked and archived within an enterprise-wide Learning Management System. Broadband will be adequate to support single as well as multiplayer gaming as well as multiple user access. Content will be available in the deployed setting and by portable device. Validation research will be conducted to determine adequacy of training, skill acquisition, and clinical performance when deployed and in garrison to include impact on team training and resultant patient safety data.</p>
<p>As you prepare your response, review all RFI areas and projects. The Air Force desires that the web based system components be compatible and interoperable.<br /><br />Five RFI Areas</p>
<p>1. Medical Training Virtual Environments <br />2. Medical Gaming <br />3. Learning Management System<br />4. Synthetic Tissue Model <br />5. Virtual Reality with Haptic Feedback</p>
<p>Responders can provide a response for a single RFI, all five RFIs, or any combination thereof. Each RFI will contain a clear response to each of the desired capabilities (referred to as Key Performance Parameters and Key System Attributes). Desired capabilities are explained in greater depth in paragraph 4 below. Responses to this RFI are due by 4 PM (1600) CDT, four weeks from the date of posting.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are applicable in their entirety to each of the five RFI without exception!</p>
<p>1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Information Test Bed (AFMISTB) is conducting market research for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program capability that will provide AFMS personnel validated, standardized and effective strategic, tactical, and operational training world-wide via virtual learning environments and using realistic synthetic tissue models.</p>
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation for a proposal or quote from the DoD or the United States Air Force (USAF). Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the government as such nor will they be considered by the Government as a binding contract.</p>
<p>Responders may submit RFIs on as many of the five areas as they choose; however, they must submit a single response for each RFI area they are responding to. Respondents are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled in accordance with existing business practices. It will be assumed by the government that a responder has legal right to use the technology or other elements of their response without restriction. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned to the originator, but will be protected as proprietary information. Other than questions associated with this RFI, AFMISTB will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future RFIs, RFQs, or RFPs associated with information outside the scope of the AFMM&amp;S Program.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The Air Force Medical Support Agency Requirements Division (AFMSA/SG5R) has identified a need for the development of synthetic tissue and virtual learning environments at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of Air Force medical operations. This strategy is conducive to recruiting and delivering training to a generation of Americans who grew up in the digital age. To provide this required capability within the context of the above operational environment and the Surgeon General's intent, it is imperative the AFMS develop and implement a course of action for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of providing medical readiness, currency, sustainment, team, and graduate medical education training in central locations are insufficient for the scope, complexity, and flexibility of required medical knowledge, expertise and technical proficiency. Specifically there is a shortage of standardized training curriculum, trainers, funds, time allocated for training, and lack of effective means to expose trainees to appropriate learning situations. Increased use of modeling and simulation by the military services and the field of medicine and surgery has become an integral means to overcome these barriers. Research has also shown that virtual environments provide an immersive learning experience and, when coupled with haptic (tactile) feedback, can simulate real life situations and teach learners how to plan and manage potential complications. Medical gaming has been shown to improve cognitive function and critical thinking skills. Also, synthetic tissue development that mimics biological functions can augment live tissue training. A learning management system will capture all performance metrics from each system to track outcome measures over time.</p>
<p>AFMISTB is seeking information about academic, prototypical, developmental, foreign, and domestic commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed above (and identified in each separate RFI). Anyone who can offer DIACAP approved commercial off-the-shelf (COTS),Government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or research and development (R&amp;D) options that fulfill the capabilities outlined above (and/or each of the attached RFI's) should respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: The AFMMST Program concept establishes the requirement and foundation for research, development, and operational testing of novel modeling and simulation training environments and standardized educational curricula. The concept includes, but is not limited to technologies related to standards of care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance of clinical health problems of concern to beneficiaries of military healthcare, trauma management and aerospace expeditionary operations.</p>
<p>AFMSA/SG5R assembled a high performance team (HPT) composed of subject matter experts (SME) who identified the requirements needed to fill the capability gap. They categorized the requirements into two main groups: Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA). The KPPs are mandatory requirements while the KSAs are other key system attributes.<br />Each of the following RFIs contains a list of specific KPPs and KSAs. There is some overlap in these as Service and Joint requirements require standardization to ensure intra and interoperability among systems and standardization in both system and networking security infrastructure and procedures. Responses to an RFI should address all of the requirements identified in that particular unique set of requirements.</p>
<p>Submission should comply with "open architecture" standards to the extent practical. ANY sole or proprietary solutions must be clearly identified in the RFI response.</p>
<p>5. CONTACT INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Mr. James (Levie) Herndon Office Manager, AFMISTB via e-mail at levie.herndon.ctr@us.af.mil.&nbsp; <br /><br />Amended:&nbsp; Responses must be received on or before 4 PM (1600) CST, 2 May 2011. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information.<br /><br />Please include the number and name of the RFI or RFI areas you are responding to, a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, and indicate whether the company is a foreign or US-domestic entity in the contents of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Responses should describe the company's capability to offer, field, and sustain an AFMMST Technology research and development program as characterized by the requirements addressed in the RFI.s If unable to provide an AFMMST Technology research and development program capable of meeting all identified requirements, the respondent should offer tradeoff considerations.</p>
<p>6. LATE SUBMISSIONS: Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future requests for proposals. Communications with AFMISTB with regard to this RFI will only be permitted in writing during the RFI response period.<br />Responses to the RFI received by AFMISTB after the submittal deadline and time indicated may be considered. The respondent assumes the risk of the method of dispatch chosen. Postmarking by the submittal date and time shall not substitute for actual response receipt.</p>
<p>7. OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSE TO RFI: All informational material submitted in response to this request will become property of USAF. Physical samples will be returned to the vendor at the owner's written requests and their own expense.</p>
<p>8. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPARATION EXPENSES: Under no circumstances shall AFMISTB be responsible for any response preparation expenses, submission costs, or any other expenses, costs, or damages, of whatever nature incurred as a result of the respondent's participation in this RFI process. The respondent understands and agrees that it submits its response at its own risk and expense, and releases AFMISTB from any claim for damages or other liability arising out of the RFI process.</p>
<p>9. ERRORS IN RESPONSE: AFMISTB shall not be liable for any errors in respondent's response. The respondent is responsible for careful review of its entire response to ensure that all information is correct and complete. The respondent is liable for all errors or omissions contained in its responses.</p>
