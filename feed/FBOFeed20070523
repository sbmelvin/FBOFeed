<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on the basis of sole source, a purchase order to Biosearch Technologies Inc., 81 Digital Drive, Novato, California, 94949 in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The  order will cover custom prepared primers, probes and biotin labeled primers for conjugation to microspheres. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR part 6.302-1 in that Biosearch Technologies is original producer for the custom primers and probes used with the conjugated microspheres used to validate BioWatch Reagents. Custom synthesis and conjugations, especially with regard to changes in scale, can result in a high degree of variability from lot to lot.  The BioWatch primers and probes produced by Biosearch, have been validated via testing conducted at other state and federal laboratories to ensure optimum reproducibility of test results.  Biosearch Technologies is the only company that has an established, validated, and proprietary production process for the synthesis of primers and probes used with BioWatch microspheres.  The purchase of this product from Biosearch Technologies will maintain consistency between the validated product and the produced product.  The anticipated period of performance is one months from date the order is placed.  To the best of our knowledge only Biosearch Technologies can provide the custom synthesized primers and probes needed to produce conjugated microspheres produced under the same conditions that the product was validated under. Screening alternate vendors would require additional validation processes which would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the BioWatch reagent requirements.  However, CDC will consider any other responsible source responding to the Request for Quotes (RFQ). The RFQ will be available for downloading when issued, approximately on  May 24, 2007.  All questions/concerns about the RFQ shall be submitted via e-mail to BBiltz@cdc.gov. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.

The purpose of the acquisition is to purchase one complete Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation monitoring and data acquisition and analysis hardware and software, QCM D300 system plus a box of 5 silicon dioxide coated crystals and 5 polystyrene coated crystals.  QCM technology has played an important role in measuring thin film deposition on surfaces in manufacturing and interfacial chemistry research and is now beginning to be applied to environmental processes studies.  This instrument will be used to explore the basic phenomena governing colloidal (natural colloidal materials and man-made nanomaterials) interactions with model soil and sediment surfaces (ex. QCM silicon dioxide and polystyrene coated crystals).  A better understanding of these interactions will improve the ability to model the fate and transport of colloids and nanomaterials in the environment. The system shall:  (1) have nanogram per cm2 sensitivity for liquid applications; (2) be fully integrated with on board temp control (+ 0.02oC) and liquid flow-through chamber; (3) come complete with a data station consisting of a current computer and a minimum flat screen of 19?; (4) include all accessories for crystal handling, changing, and cleaning; (5) include hardware and software capabilities for dissipation analysis of elastic films (at least 10-7 delta D in liquid); and (6) accept a wide range of coated crystals to be used as models for a range of environmental surfaces.  Software shall include a complete set of tools for acquiring and analyzing output data and for plotting layer mass, thickness, and elasticity over time.  Software and hardware must be Section 508 compliant.  Equipment is required by 07.31.07.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 339111.  It has been determined that Q-Sense is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  No solicitation or request for quote (RFQ) is available.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA?s requirements as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing by email to Rick Pittman.

<DESC>The 727 ACSG proposes to contract with L-3 Communications of Greenville TX to provide Mission Communications System (MCS) Support for the VC-25A, C-20 and C-9C Special Air Mission (SAM) aircraft.  The MCS is a suite of airborne electronic equipment and systems composed of voice, data, facsimile, Internet Protocol (IP) and encryption/decryption equipment interconnected with radio communications systems by the Communications Switching System (CSS).  The switch is software and hardware driven.  The proprietary data for the switch is owned by L-3 Communications (previously E-Systems Inc.).  The Government has only limited rights in the data for the switching systems and therefore will not be able to provide the data to contractors.  While the MCS for each of the aircraft within the SAM fleet complies with the same general MCS description, each platform has a different specific combination of equipment to suit the mission and aircraft size.  The proposed effort will include program management, review of service reports, daily requests for technical information, performing preliminary engineering investigations, Field Technical Representatives, maintenance of the Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and the requirement to maintain drawings and technical data files.  The proposed effort will also include 24-hour standby service to respond to in-flight emergencies and emergency inquiries, on-site support and operation of test benches located at Andrews AFB, MD, on-site return-to-service capability for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and SIL used for sustainment of current software and testing prior to integration of new systems to the MCS.  Non-recurring effort consists of requests for software/hardware corrections; engineering feasibility studies, analyses and investigations of Deficiency Reports (DRs) and mishaps; requirements for technical orders, preliminary engineering change proposals, hardware/software development and test.  Non-recurring effort also will include modifications, upgrades and enhancements requiring design, testing, integration, kit/spare purchases and kit installs at depot maintenance facilities and in the field.  This effort also provides for troubleshooting, modification or repair at the Contractor's facility.

<DESC>The mission of the 95th Mission Support Group, Logistics Readiness Division, is to provide top quality, customer-oriented, Base Supply, Fuels and Logistics Materiel Control Activity (LMCA) services, hereinafter referred to as supply services, to the civilian (government and contractor) and military workforce of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) and associate units supported via the Interservice/Intergovernmental Support Agreement (ISA) process. The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to provide AFFTC with efficient and effective performance-based supply services by a highly-qualified, fully trained, professional, and dedicated workforce.  To this end, the contractor shall execute established procedures outlined in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, Volume 1 through 9,(USAF Supply Manual) dated 1 April 2007, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 23-201 (Fuels Management) dated 7 Jul 2004, and Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI) 23-201 (LMCA Operation Instruction) dated 4 February 2004, in a manner that ensures best use of resources in support of assigned missions.  The contractor must continuously keep abreast of, and implement, all technical changes and upgrades to standard systems in order to ensure mission readiness.  Unless otherwise specified, all chapter references contained in this PWS apply to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, dated 1 April 2007.  With the exception of the items/services specified as being government-furnished in Section III hereof, the contractor shall provide all resources (labor and materials) to perform the supply services described within this PWS in a manner that meets the objectives stated herein. Under directions from HQ USAF, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is presently exploring the feasibility of centralizing the supply functions of Stock Control, MICAP, Records Maintenance, Equipment Management, and Computer Support from base level to one command-regional center.  Should a final decision be rendered to centralize, any changes to the PWS as a result of centralized functions will be accomplished IAW with contract terms and conditions.

<DESC>NAICS - 236220.   General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting competitive proposals for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Construction & Repair / Alterations with Design/Build capabilities.  This contract will have eight geographical zones.  The following small business set asides have been established for this procurement:
Zone I - New Mexico - 8a,  
Zone II - El Paso - 8a,  
Zone III - Oklahoma - HUBZone,  
Zone IV - Dallas / Fort Worth - 8a,  
Zone VI - San Antonio - 8a,   
Zone VIII - Louisiana - HUBZone.     

The remaining zones will be open to all business concerns. Woman Owned, Veteran Owned, HUBZone and Small / Small Disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit an offer.
Zone V - Houston / Austin - Full and Open,   
Zone VII - Arkansas - Full and Open.    

See ATTACHMENT A - IDIQ Contract Zones, with geographical zones outlined.  

Awards will be made by zones within the primary areas.  The secondary contract area is the contiguous United States.  Contractors interested in this solicitation SHALL HAVE A BONA FIDE PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE ZONE OF INTEREST AS OF THE DATE PROPOSALS ARE DUE, ON OR AROUND JULY 23, 2007.  The IDIQ contracts shall be for one basic year with a government option to extend the term of the contract one year at a time, not to exceed five years total.  THE SUCCESSFUL FIRMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ALL LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ZONE AWARDED, see ATTACHMENT B -Zone-City Listing; includes but is not limited to the cities listed.  Awardees will also be required to submit schedules for orders in Microsoft Project.  Pre-proposal teleconferences for Phase I will be held in Fort Worth, El Paso, and San Antonio, TX, New Orleans, LA and Albuquerque, NM, tentatively scheduled to begin on or about June 25, 2007.  Please monitor FedBizOpps for more information regarding the scheduling of the pre-proposal conferences.    

Multiple awards will be made with each awardee being guaranteed a minimum of $200.  The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $500.  The maximum ordering limitation of each contract is up to $10 million per year.  This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using source selection procedures with a two phase process.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded to the contractors offering the best value to the Government.  Technical ability is significantly more important than price.  The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)) therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror.  The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.    

Phase I selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance:  Factor 1 - Experience and past performance of the prime contractor and key subcontractors on similar projects, Factor 2 - Qualifications and past experience of key personnel.  Key personnel will need to demonstrate a working knowledge and understanding of IDIQ contracts.  On occasion small businesses have been unable to field the necessary trades and craftsmen to handle multiple projects in a number of different buildings simultaneously.  For this reason it is a requirement of this solicitation that prospective contractors submit with their proposals a separate and detailed plan as to how they would staff their organization in order to meet these commonplace surges in work requiring multiple projects to be executed simultaneously in different buildings and locations.  Phase II selection criteria will be Management Approach, including Capacity, Scheduling, and Planning.  Offerors will not be reimbursed for Phase I or Phase II proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded contractor refuses to accept work for any line item included in a delivery order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government.    

Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only.  No hard copies will be available.  Contractors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents.  These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 7, 2007.  It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Contractors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  I encourage contractors to periodically check the site; it is the contractor's responsibility to make sure you have all of the documents related to the procurement.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Demonstration Program.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure Integrated Bridge Navigation Systems (IBNS) on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis as part of the DDG-51 Ship Class “DDG Modernization” program.  Each IBNS shall include all specified hardware necessary to integrate the existing bridge and navigation equipment onboard in-service DDGs and provide a single integrated system capable of providing propulsion and steering controls for the ship.  The IBNS shall be designed to leverage Government computer programs and DDG-51 Class Standard Equipment (CSE) computer programs that are either already developed or are currently being upgraded for the DDG-51 new construction program.  The IBNS shall be capable of meeting American Bureau of Shipbuilding (ABS) Naval Vessel Rules (NVR) requirements for Navigation systems, and shall designed to limit the impact to the existing in service ship cable plant, power and cooling systems and limit the duration of ship down time for the installation.   This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitiations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  The technical specification to the solicitation includes a “Distribution Statement D” marking, meaning access is restricted to DoD and DoD contractors only.  In order to control access to these documents, they can only be accessed through Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  Access to this system will require a username and password and should be obtained by any interested parties by completing the registration process on the FedTeDS website.  A FedTeDS Vendor User Guide is available on th!  e FedTeDS homepage.   This procurement will include a basic requirement for a first article test unit, two shipsets, data, and engineering services with four IBNS options for up to 16 additional units that may be exercised during the five year period of the contract.   No industry day is planned for this procurement.  A draft solicitation is being released with this announcement in FBO for industry review and comment.  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a trade off analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final RFP.  Comment is requested on the warranty provisions as well.  Comments should be provided within 30 days of the posting of this announcement.  A competitive solicitation will be issued after comments have been evaluated.  All inquiries should be emailed to timothy.starker@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source contract to BAE Systems of Greenlawn, NY 11740 for the procurement of three (3) AN/VRC-99B(C) radios, PN:  1051054G-4, that will be used in the deployment of the AN/WLD-1(V)1 Remote Minehunting System.  The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio is used as part of the communications subsystem used to control the Remote Minehunting Vehicle (RMV).  It is part of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) link hardware that is used to control the RMV.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio, manufactured by BAE Systems, was competitively chosen at the beginning of the RMS development program by the prime development contractor and the Data Link Subsystem (DLS) was subsequently designed and tested around it for LOS operations.  This radio is an integrated part of the RMS DLS subsystem and is uniquely capable of operating with the existing hardware and software already designed into!   the system.  Specific commands for remote, automatic operation of the radio are incorporated into the existing system, requiring the identical radio for plug-and-play operation.  Other radio features that are required for RMS operations include: Embedded encryption approved for SECRET level data transmission, operation in the 1.7 - 2.0 GHz radio frequency band used by the military, data rates up to 3.15 Mbps, and automatic network establishment of at least three radios.  There are no other radio(s) currently built that have such features and can operate with RMS off-the-shelf.  This is a follow-on contract for the production of a highly specialized equipment within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of items being acquired, would not be recovered through competition.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Offic!  er, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAIC S Code 334220 applies.  SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.  FSC is 5820.  Point of contact for this procurement is the Contract Specialist Stacy Figlinski at stacy.figlinski@navy.mil.

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to DRS Sonar Systems, 400 Professional Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland to provide non-personal technical support services for recommended performance upgrades to the AN/SQQ-32 Sonar System, which includes Classification Sonar Hardware Components & Sub-systems, Ship Sonar Processing Equipment, and the common High Frequency Wide Band / Classification Sonar Operator Consoles.  Contractor support is also required to review the AN/SQQ-32 Sonar System and make recommendations for upgrading performance of the classification sonar sub-system.  The contractor will also evaluate the High Frequency Wide Band (HFWB) and Classification sonar common operator console designs to accommodate upgrades to the system and to incorporate new technology requirements.  The current identical AN/SQQ-32 Legacy operator consoles will be upgraded to incorporate system redesign to accommodate new fiber optic t!  echnology within the AN/SQQ-32 system.   This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Thales Company was the 1980’s designer, developer, manufacturer, and current vendor for the AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 Classify Sonar Sub-system and its associated parts and components.  Sonar Systems (a DRS / Thales Company joint US venture), is the only company that can support the US Navy’s AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 mine hunting sonar system pre-planned re-design to provide system analysis and upgraded design information based on obsolescence and reliability issues currently plaguing this now outdated design.  Through Sonar Systems affiliation with Thales, they are the only US company to have developed and put into production, the current US Navy’s AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 Classification mine-hunting sonar.  Given the complexity of the AN/SQQ032(V)3 system and the level of system knowledge required to evaluate the High Frequency Wide Band (HFWB) and Classification sonar common operator console designs to accommodate upgrades to the system and to!   incorporate new technology requirements, Sonar Systems is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  Sonar System’s corporate experience would significantly mitigate schedule and technical risk associated with the sonar’s functional capabilities, parts obsolescence, system reliability issues, and common architecture with the mine countermeasures combat suite.

<DESC>AERO 51B MUNITIONS TRAILERS.  Contract N68335-06-C-0383 was awarded to DeVal Incorporated of Philadelphia, PA for the Conversion in Lieu of Procurement (CILOP) of the AERO-51 Munitions Trailer. The effort covers the disassembly of the trailers, upgrading of the running gear, and returning the trailers to Ready For Issue (RFI) condition. The contract also contains a line item for any miscellaneous parts and repairs needed to return the trailers to RFI condition. During disassembly, some parts common to all trailers were found to need repair. The government has determined that it is more cost effective to incorporate zero maintenance bushings into the drawbar, steering knuckles, steering arm and leaf springs and replace all of the brake hoses with a stronger hose. The total quantity of trailers covered by this action is 526. As a result of this change trailers will not require any scheduled maintenance for at least 20 years. Negotiations will be conducted on a sole source basis with DeVal Inc. because they are already under contract to disassemble the trailers and these new parts will be installed when the trailers are reassembled. . No solicitation package is available for this procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent NOI7109.  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC05-16.  This acquisition shall be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This is not a small business set-aside.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure from GE Healthcare on a sole source basis a AKTAFPLC chromatography system w/control to include:  Holder for system extension, mono Q 10/100gl, Column screening kit, 150ml superloop, Air sensor A-912N kit, Pump P-960,franc-920 fraction collector, (S)AKTAFPLC without frac with desktop control unit, Sample valve kit P960, ADTA user kit.  The system must provide the following:  1) the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems and other sources; 2) the system must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity; 3) the system must have the capability to automate the running of large, open columns on the system, a variety of gel filtration media, and must have  a flow rate range of .05-20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi; 4) the system must be a two-pump gradient system with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation; 5) the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides; 6) the system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography; 7) the controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based, and must allow user intervention of a running method (e.g., change of flow rate) without stopping or pausing the run; 8) the system must include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software; 9) the system must have the ability to control nine motorized valves which must provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves and documentation of valve positions at all times, and shall be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate; the system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the nest purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs; 11) control of up to nine motorized valves, chart recorder, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, air sensors, and three pumps, must all be possible from the system controller; 12) The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C; 13) The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g.  UV wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations; 14) The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions); 15) The system must allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  Other considerations will be price, warranty, and delivery date.  The North American Industry Classification System Code Number is 541710 and the Small business size standard is 500 employees.  The FOB point shall be Destination, Bethesda, Md. (inside delivery).  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.

<DESC>D--The following are the answers to the questions submitted for RFP RBK00070004: 1.	Q:  The solicitation identifies resources with associated hours for  this opportunity.  Could you please explain how these resources were identified, how hours were  determined, and whether this information was determined by an independent  contractor? 	A:  This information was determined based on historical data from  previous years. 2.	Q:  Is there an existing project plan with the resources and hours? Can  this be provided as an attachment to the solicitation? A:  No 3.	Q:  Can bidders propose resources and hour different than what is  provided in the solicitation? 	A:  No.  4.	Q:  Will there be an opportunity for follow-up questions based on the  answers that come back? 	A:  No.  There is just not enough time to go back and forth on follow up  questions regarding answers given.   5.	Q:  Section B, CLIN 0001 – since this is an IDIQ contract with task  orders to be awarded using labor rates provided, and sine the cost of C&A  tasks varies for different systems, what is the purpose of CLIN 0001,  Basic Year Certification and Accreditation? 	A:  It is just information.  The quantity, unit price and total cost will  be removed to exclude any confusion.  The contracting writing system  automatically inserts the lines.  They will be deleted manually. 6.	Q:  Section B, CLIN 0003 – the purpose of this CLIN is not clear – O/T  rates would be tied to specific labor categories for which overtime was  approved by the Government.  For salaried personnel this would be at the  normal hourly rate quoted; for wage determination personnel this would  normally be at 1 ½ times the hourly rate.   For this proposal, what is the  derivation of what should be entered for 320 hours of O/T rates for  unspecified labor categories? A:  This CLIN will be removed.  Overtime will be determined on a need for  basis.   7.	Q:  SOW, Para 2, Page 1:  What specific tools are currently owned and  in use by BIA for accomplishing the various C&A related tasks (Tasks 1-12)  in the SOW? A:  No automated tools are in place to accomplish the C&A tasks.   Microsoft suite of tools are available (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc). 8.	Q:   SOW, Para 2, Pages 1-4.  Specified due dates may be unrealistic  depending on the type of system, scope of the system,  operating/applications software, etc.  Will due dates for specific  documents under specific tasks be more accurately defined in task orders  that are issued? 	A:  Yes 9.	Q:   Does the Government anticipate the issuance of task orders which  would require the use of contractor owned facilities (offices, IA labs,  document storage, etc)? 	A:  No. 10.	Q:   The RFP states that Past Performance that started after 1 May  2005 will not be considered for the evaluation; can this requirement be  modified or waived? 	A:  That date should read 1 Oct 2006.  It will be amended to read 1 Oct.  2006. 11.	Q:  What clearances, if any, are required for contract personnel?” A:  See 5.3 Security Screening in SOW 12.	Q:  Volume 1, section 4.2.1.3.1:  Indicates that the government will  not consider any new contracts awarded or where performance began on or  after 1 November 2004 due to limited performance history.  Is it the  government’s intention to only accept work prior to the November 2004 date  or work that occurred after the November 2004 date? 	A:  That date should read 1 November 2005.  The government will accept  work on or after 1 November 2005. 13.	Q:  Can you please provide the incumbent contractor name/s and  contract number/s for this initiative? 	A:  The incumbent is SeNet International Corp.  The contract number is  SMK00050066.  14.	Q:   Is there a ceiling value for this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite  Quantity contract? 	A:   15.	Q:   Table 3.1 (pg 17) and Para 5.6 (pg 22) – Confirm that resumes are  not included on the Vol. II page limitation of 20 pages? 	A:  Resumes do not count toward the 20 page limitation.   16.	Q:   Para 5.2 (pg 21) – Was the cross-reference matrix sample referred  to the Mission Capability Executive Summary supposed to be included? 	A:  There was not one included.  It was placed in the RFP mistakenly.   17.	Q:   Para 4.2.1.3.1 (pg 20), para 3.3.2 (pg 26) – The Government wants  Past Performance to be current and relevant. However, there are  conflicting statements in the referenced paragraphs that the Government  will not consider any new contracts started after 1 Nov 2004 / 1 May 2005.   Since you evaluate past performance on the merits of each contract, will  you re-phrase to require past performance form relevant and current  contracts of at least one year duration where that year ended between the  dates 1 May 05 and 11 June 07 (proposal submission dated)? 	A:  Reference Question # 12 18.	Q:   Section C (SOW pg 12) Para 7 – Will quality control guidelines be  provided the contractor to ensure deliverables meet the expectations of  the BIA and DOI for acceptable criteria and sub sequent payment? 	A:  Guidance and expectations will be provided.   Examples of acceptable  products will be provided.  19.	Q:   Since the answers to questions my not be available until the 18  May and due to the additional hours required to recreate and design form  your PDF copy the required letters and forms included in the RFP, will you  please extend the proposal due date to 18 June? 	A:  There may be a possibility of an extension.  This will be determined  by the Contracting Officer and the Project Personnel if an extension is  merited.  20.	Q:   Is it expected that the C&A tasks will be performed on  systems/applications that are in at least the maintenance stage of the  SDLC or will C&A tasks include the creation of C&A package in support of  systems still being designed or developed? 	A:  Both, majority of systems are in maintenance stage 21.	Q:   What are the acceptable date ranges for Past Performances? 	A:  See Question # 12 22.	Q:   Do resumes count within the page limitations? 	A:  See Question number 15. 23.	Q:  What is the anticipated workload for the first year? 	A:  One third of all systems are recertified every three years, so at  least one third of total number of systems will be recertified 24.	Q:   When did the current contract start? 	A:  January 2005. 25.	Q:   How many positions are considered Key? 	A:  All – however, Security Analysts are “key” to accomplishing C&A  tasks. 26.	Q:   Which specific positions are key? 	A:  See Question 25 above  27.	Q:   In order to provide pricing details, as required in section  6.3.2, please provide the pre-established NTE prices for the “Travel”  CLIN. 	A:  $50,000.  This will be amended to include the $50,000.00 on the  Travel CLINs. 28.	Q:   Referring to page 26, section 3.3.2, “the Government will only  consider work performed within a 3 year period ending on or after Nov 1,  2002.”  In addition, “the Government will not consider any new contracts  awarded or where performance began on or after May 1, 2005.”  This appears  to conflict with the timeframes provided on page 20 (4.2.1.3.1,”…within  the last 3 years.  However the Government will not consider any new  contracts awarded or where performance began on or after Nov 1, 2004”).   Please clarify. 	A:  See Question # 12 29.	Q:   Section 2(c), Page 14 – This section states that offerors must  agree to hold prices in the offer from for 30 calendar days from the date  specified for receipt of offers.  However, on page 17, item 2.2 under  “instructions to offerors” states that the offeror shall make a clear  statement that the offer is valid for at least 180 days beyond the due  dated, and this is reiterated in section 6.2.  Please clarify which is  correct. 	A:  Section 2 (c) states that “The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in  its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of  Offers, UNLESS another time period is specified in an addendum to the  solicitation.  So the 180 days is the correct amount of days.   30.	Q:   For the electronic copies, is Adobe PDF an acceptable format, or  BIA want the information presented in Microsoft Office programs as  appropriate (Word, Excel, etc.).  If Microsoft Office is the desired  format, which version should be used? 	A:  	Word 2003 31.	Q:   In Volume II, Mission Capability, do the resumes count against  the 20 page limit?  Also, it’s stated that glossaries do not count against  page limitations; is this true for tables of contents, lists of figures,  and tabs if used? 	A:  See Question number 15 regarding resumes.   32.	Q:   With regard to BIA site visits, is there a listing of sites that  the contractor can be provided to assist with determining the level of  effort for travel? 	A:  See Question number 27 regarding the Not To Exceed amount for travel.  33.	Q:   Can BIA provide the current total number of systems/applications  that will be covered by the scope of work? 	A:  BIA currently has 42 systems 34.	Q:   How many systems are included, MA/GSS? 	A:   42 systems, 6  GSS’s;  35.	Q:   How many IP addresses are there in the internal network? 	A:  Information not available- considered confidential.  36.	Q:   Will the system assignments take place sequentially? 	A:  There will be concurrent projects 37.	Q:   Is there an incumbent for the current project? 	A:  See Question number 13. 38.	Q:  In Volume I past performance sections3.3.2, 4.2.1.3.1, 4.2.2; what  are the correct date boundaries for acceptable past performance, there is  a conflict of dates that is stated? A:  See Question # 12 39.	Q:  Do the required matrices and cross-references count against the  page limit? 	A:  No. 40.	Q:  Please clarify and amplify 4.2.17 Organization Structure Change  History, in particular, the structure/format of the required “roadmap”?   Are strategic partners or sister organizations included? 	A:  Covers Bureau of Indian Affairs Information Technology (IT) – no  partners or sister organizations are included. 41.	Q:  Please clarify the phrase “appropriately cleared for performance  prior to contract start” in 3.2.2 Mission Capability Subfactors, 3.2.2.1  Subfactor 1, Phase In/Transition.  Are the personnel expected to have  DOI/BIA clearances/badges prior to beginning work?  If so, at what level? 	A:  See 5.3 Security Screening in Statement of Work (SOW) 42.	Q:   Will BIA provide a Past Performance questionnaire in Microsoft  Word format, for example, that we could provide to our customers  electronically?  Of should offerors create their own form or should  offerors use the form in the government-provided PDF document? 	A:  Offerors should use the form in the government provided PDF  document. 43.	Q:   If an offeror is a subcontractor on a past performance reference,  would that offeror send its past performance questionnaire to its prime  contractor (e.g., ABC, Inc) or to its customer (e.g., the U.S. Department  of Defense). 	A:  To the U.S. Department of Defense.  You may need to provide DoD the  contract number, the title of the project, and the name of the project  officer. 44.	Q:   Is there an incumbent already fulfilling these requirements or is  this RFP for new work? 	A:  See Question number 13. 45.	Q:   What other companies received copies of the RFP? 	A:  This information cannot be divulged at this time. 46.	Q:   What automated application is currently being used (if any) for  the C & A process by BIA? 	A: None at this time 47.	Q:   Are there any subcontract provisions or limitations? 	A:  Yes.  FAR 52.219-14, entitled “Limitations on Subcontracting.” 48.

Q:   May we have an updated listing of all BIA locations in the U.S.? 	A: Not available – not needed for the purposes of this SOW 50.	Q:   Is there an incumbent contractor on this BIA C&A project, if yes,  which one? 	A:  See Question number 13. 51.	Q:   What would be any work interaction (reporting, co-operation, etc)  between Contractor and other BIA managers, i.e.: Patrick Ragsdale, Ross  Swimmer, Brian Burns, Joan Tyler, Thao le, John Messano, or Pat Moloney? 	A:  Work is accomplished through interaction with the management and  staff affiliated with the Office of IT Security and Privacy.  Any other  interactions are accomplished via interface with an “Office” not  necessarily a person, i.e., Operations, Systems, Development,  Telecommunications, etc.  52.	Q:  How many BIA systems Contractor needs to Certify and to Accredit  during the contract (current number systems)? 	A: One third of systems are re-accredited on an annual basis. 53.	Q:   Please provide more details about potential traveling trips, how  often (how many times a year) would be such as trips, for how long at the  time, how many contractors need to travel together in a team, to which US  BIA locations, etc? 	A:  Majority of systems are managed at the Herndon, VA location.  When  site visits are necessary, the team makeup is two contractors with a  government oversight person.  Six trips on an annual basis is about the  norm.  54.	Q:   When Contractor employees have already active Secret or Top  Secret clearances, is it still necessary to obtain NACI? 	A: Yes, but it becomes easier for employees who already have active  clearances, see 5.3 Security Screening in SOW. 55.	Q:   How many Major Applications and General Support Systems does BIA  own and of these, how many require C&A in the base year award? 	A: 42 systems in total, 6 general support systems, one third of systems  are recertified on an annual basis. 56.	Q:   Proposal guidance says that resumes count toward the 20 page  limit for Volume II Mission Capability – each resume is limited to 2  pages.  In addition, the proposal guidance from Volume II indicates “The  Offeror shall provide a resume for each respective individual who plans to  work on this contract.  The resumes should be explicit and detailed as to  the employment experience each resume has regarding Certification and  Accreditation work.”  Assuming we submit 4-5 resumes to demonstrate  experience and capability of our Key Personnel, this would take up 50% of  the page limit for Volume II.  Did BIA intend for resumes to count towards  the 20 page limit assigned to Executive Summary, Transition plan,  Management, and Technical capability discussion? 	A:  See Question number 15. 57.	Q:  Are we required to use our own laptops and desktops? A: No  - equipment is provided. 58.	Q:   Did the government intend for the project start date before 1  November 2004 with a project end date within the last 3 years/pending or  can offeror’s submit past performance for projects that began in 2005? 	A:  See Question # 12 59.	Q:  Task 7 – indicates deliverables are Contingency Plans, Test Plans,  and Contingency Test Results.  The Task does not specify that contractor  will lead contingency test exercises and document results.  Please advise  whether the Contractor is required to lead or participate in Contingency  Test exercises and document the results. 	A:  For a new system, the C&A team initiates the Contingency Plan,  devises the Test Plan, implements the test plan and documents the results.   For existing systems, annual contingency plan testing is NOT the  responsibility of the Office of IT Security and Privacy, it is handled  outside the scope of this contract. 60.	Q:   Task 12 – User approvals – Will the contractor implement and/or  record approvals that have been authorized by the BIA? 	A:  No – approvals are sought and recorded by BIA management - as deemed  necessary. Any recorded approvals needed by a C&A team to complete its  work, are made available to the team by the Office of IT Security and  Privacy management and staff. 61.	Q:   Who is the incumbent, and are they a Native American Firm? 	A:  See Question number 13. 62.	Q:   Page 22 of the RFP, paragraph 5.3, states “The Offeror shall also  exhibit that its personnel and facilities are properly cleared for  contract performance upon contract award.”  What facility clearance is  sufficient to meet this requirement? 	A:  None 63.	Q:   Page 22 and 23 of the Attachment 2, paragraph 19.  Key Personnel;  this paragraph lists five labor categories for key personnel.  How many  resumes are required for each one of these categories? 	A:  We request that you provide a resume for each individual that plans  on working on this contract, be it one or ten.  We request that you  provide 2 pages max for each resume. 64.	Q:   Are the information systems covered by POA&Ms, and if so are they  available to the contractor? 	A:  Yes, each system has an associated POA&M and it is available to the  C&A team. 65.	Q:   For the information systems that are to be covered by the  contract, please provide the following information:	(a) Number of systems;   (b) Security categorization of the systems; (c) Development and  definition status;  (d) Size;  (e) Major technologies used;  (f) Status of  IT security-related documentation, including the latest SAR or ST&E  reports;  (g) Current C&A status and related time-line;  (h) Degree of  compliance with SP 800-53, Revision 1;  and (i) Common security controls  identified, assessed, and documented. A:   &#61607;	BIA has 42 systems (6 are GSS) &#61607;	Categorizations are based on FIPS 199 and NIST 800-60 guidance &#61607;	No “high” classifications (most are moderate) &#61607;	All systems have an Authority to Operate (ATO) &#61607;	All system are NIST SP 800-53 compliant &#61607;	 All systems have Risk Assessments, System Security Plans, ST&E  Test Plans and ST&E Reports, POA&Ms, Contingency Plans, and Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA).   &#61607;	C&A documentation is readily available to C&A team in both  hardcopy and softcopy format &#61607;	 Common tools are used in testing (Nessus, Microsoft Baseline  Analyzer, Internet Security Scanner, Oracle Auditing Scanner, SQL Plus,  Enum) &#61607;	No automated tools are in place at this time to assist in the C&A  tasks.

<SUBJECT>B -- Investigate effects of wear and use of protective clothing materials
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCCLG-2007-43533
<RESPDATE>060707
<ARCHDATE>06222007
<CONTACT>Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (412)386-6431, Fax (412)386-6843, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Helath, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement for Development and Validation of PPE Lab Preconditioning Methods.  

A.  Purpose of Contract

The purpose of this contract is to investigate the effects of wear and use on protective clothing materials in order to recommend specific methods that can be used to evaluate the barrier qualities of clothing materials over their expected service life. The specific objective of this contract is to recommend approaches and methods that can become ASTM standards or be incorporated into NFPA standards that address CBRN protection of first responders in reusable clothing and equipment.

B.  Statement of Work

The work effort covers a 2-year research program.  The first year involves the identification and development of specific preconditioning techniques for selected PPE ensembles and mission areas. This process will entail observing the conditions of wear for clothing based on repeated, documented use, the evaluation of potential techniques for simulating the types of observed wear, the consequent creation of a detailed test plan, conduct of an external peer review and formation of a project team with establishment of supporting capabilities at different laboratories.  The second year effort will address validation and implementation of recommended preconditioning techniques into NFPA and ASTM protective clothing standards through the development of new procedures, practices, and tests methods, as needed, with the final deliverable being a final peer reviewed technical report discussing all activities and findings of the project. 

C.  Detailed Technical Requirements:

During the first year of the project, the contractor shall use the following specific steps as part of their investigations:

1.	Propose the key ensemble material and use parameters to be investigated for determining the durability of barrier protection in protective clothing materials against CBRN agents and other hazardous substances. Proposals should address all elements that incorporate CBRN barrier materials. Determine the types of ensembles and respective standards to be targeted as part of the work effort.

2.	Research specific conditions of clothing that result from its use and care by examining a large number of clothing sets exhibiting different levels of wear where the service life of the clothing is well understood. Devise potential approaches for linking the condition of clothing to its documented use and care. Interview key end user stakeholders and manufacturers for determining how field observations relate to clothing barrier performance. Document the findings of this research to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

3.	Conduct a review of current procedures that are applied in different specifications, including NFPA and other standards, for protective ensembles and elements, which document how clothing items and materials are preconditioned prior to barrier or other forms of testing. The review shall include a literature search and investigation of prior studies performed on first responder and related clothing and equipment. Document the findings of this review to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

4.	Perform limited testing to determine the appropriateness of test methods and to allow for the narrowing of selected preconditioning techniques to be considered as part of a detailed, comprehensive test plan. Document the findings of this testing to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

5.	Prepare a detailed, comprehensive plan to investigate the application of selected preconditioning methods to specific materials for simulated use and care. The test plan shall include the results of the research and reviews conducted in Tasks 1 through 4. The test plan should identify specific materials to be tested, the types of testing to be conducted, how the materials are to be tested, how results will be reported, and how criteria will be established to determine if proposed preconditioning methods are appropriate for modeling ensemble wear. The detailed, comprehensive plan should be submitted for external peer review.

6.	Respond to comments from the external peer review with specific changes in the detailed, comprehensive test plan. Conduct additional reviews, research, and testing as needed to address and identified deficiencies in the detailed, comprehensive test plan. The contractor shall prepare a revised detailed, comprehensive test plan that incorporates all changes.

7.	Make arrangements for carrying out the execution of the comprehensive, detailed test plan. These arrangements shall include establishment of a project team to carrying out the plan and identifying specific facilities where evaluations will be carried out.

During the second year of the project, the contractor shall:
	
8.	Provide an interim report on initial testing to determine the appropriateness of preconditioning techniques for specific protective ensembles.

9.	Prepare a report on validation of preconditioning techniques and how each investigated technique simulated wear and care of different protective ensembles.

10.	Investigate potential techniques that may be used in the field to monitor or assess the condition of barrier materials and their efficacy in providing continued CBRN protection. Findings of this investigation shall be provided in the project final report.

11.	Create recommendations for specific preconditioning techniques in revision of specific protective ensemble standards. The proposed techniques shall be prepared in the appropriate style and form for the respective ASTM and NFPA standards as consistent with the standards to be affected. The project team shall prepare all recommendations for direct submission to the appropriate standards organization and make the submission.

12.	Prepare a manuscript as a co-author with the Government Technical Project Officer for submission to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

13.	Complete a final report with all project data and findings.  

Note:  Stakeholders for this project include certification organizations, standards development organizations, manufacturers, first responders and the DHS Office for Grants and Training federal equipment grant programs for local/state agencies. The end result of this project is a series of conditioning techniques that can be applied to protective ensemble materials to mimic wear and use for demonstrating how barrier protection is sustained with multiple-uses.  By determining realistic preconditioning procedures that simulate real world use on these ensembles, the industry will be able to provide a wider range of NFPA certified products to the estimated 1.5 million first responders for use during CBRN incidents.  This means that first responders have the opportunity to be outfitted in durable, less stressful ensembles with the latest technology when they find themselves in a CBRN incident.

D.   Period of Performance

The Contractor shall complete the technical effort specified under Section C, within twenty one (21) months after the effective date of the contract. The anticipated term of the contract, including time allowed for draft approval and submission of the approved final report, is twenty four (24) months after the effective date of the contract.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract
 
1.6	Place of Performance/Hours of Operation.  The building where the work will be performed is a government-owned structure and is identified as Building #1.  the location of the building is within the Center?s confines at the following address:

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This acquisition is for Installation Protection Program (IPP) Prime Contractor for the Joint Project Office Guardian, Falls Church, VA, and Other Government Agencies related to Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO), Chemical and Biological Defense.  The selected contractor shall provide anti-terrorism (AT) capabilities against potential weapons of mass destruction (WMD) events at approximately 39 CONUS installations and 31 OCONUS installations.  The IPP is envisioned to encompass an integrated and tiered family of chemical, biological and radiological systems that includes detection, identification, warning, information management, decision support, incident management, medical surveillance, individual and collective protection, and emergency response capabilities. 

The Baseline Tier consists of non-material solutions to include training materials, military and civilian Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA) templates, and exercise plans and scenarios. Tier 1 consists of the Baseline Tier and adds material solutions to include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) portable and handheld detection, mass casualty response capability, individual protective equipment, incident management systems, and first responder pharmaceuticals. Tier 2 consists of the Baseline Tier and Tier 1 capabilities, and adds collective protection, decision support systems, and fixed chemical and biological sensors. This approach is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of specific installations, while standardizing major system elements to provide cost effective solutions.  The selected contractor shall be postured to execute simultaneous CONUS and OCONUS program requirements.  The program will provide a common suite of equipment that will be tailored for each installation utilizing both commercial sources and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).

The effort encompasses conduct of all analysis, system engineering and design, fielding, assembly, testing, installation qualification, new equipment training, documentation, planning, and management required to support this effort. It also includes all materials, software, and services necessary to ensure the successful performance of the responsibilities entailed in executing this program.  During program execution the selected contractor shall be responsible for the following major efforts:  installation survey and design system fielding; installment and qualification testing development of all required training materials, to include operator and maintenance training, web-based training table top exercises (TTX), and field exercises; full installation exercises support of developmental testing technical documentation, logistics support planning, long term storage, accountability of COTS/GOTS equipment for execution, and sustainment to include inventory management. 

The Government anticipates the award of one (1) award under full and open competition.  The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract.

The salient characteristics of a Reconfigurable Cockpit Base Frame System (BFS) that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Group?s (EWG) Manned Flight Simulators (MFS) are: 
a) BFS must allow for the accurate relative placement, within ? inch, of all controls;
b) BFS must provide rudder pedals that simulate the real aircraft pedal configurations, including yaw control, nose-wheel steering, and ground braking of the simulated aircraft; 
c) the pedal placement within the BFS must be adjustable to accommodate the aircraft variations and normal pilot adjustments for rapid reconfiguration; 
d) BFS must include a programmable control loading system that provides force feedback through the controls to the pilot [This control feedback must provide both fixed (user programmable) and dynamic (scenario dependent) control loading thus allowing configuration of breakout force, dead band, force gradient, detents (multiple gradients), hysteresis (force and position), friction, damping, displacement limits, and stick shaker (associated with stall and buffet) capabilities]; 
e) BFS structure must support the weight and size of actual panel mounted components;
f) BFS must allow for space for component cooling and routing of power and signal cables;
g) BFS must accommodate multiple system power components, including power conditioning (to prevent damage by voltage and frequency transients), power distribution and isolation equipment for individual system components as necessary to prevent one component?s operation from impacting another component, and multiple AC and DC power supplies?with all these components located in the cockpit base frame EIA bays to support the power needs of the cockpit consoles.  
h) BFS must accommodate at least three (3) separate data acquisition chassis, to be installed in the cockpit base frame EIA bays, and be able to be connected directly with cockpit devices mounted in the side and front consoles;  
i) BFS position must be adjustable relative to the out-the-window scene display, such that the nominal pilot?s eyepoint can be aligned to the eyepoint of the out-the-window scene;
j) BFS must be separable from the out-the-window scene generation system (visual system), to allow configuring any specific cockpit with any specific visual system;
k) Docking, alignment and locking mechanisms must be provided to ensure the correct alignment of the cockpit structure with the visual system;  
l) BFS design enables the pilot to safely egress the cockpit unassisted;  
m) BFS must provide a safety power-down capability to remove all electrical power, and this emergency power shutdown for the cockpit is to be located in and near the cockpit via at least two remote control devices (one for the pilot and one for the operator); and
n) The cockpit base frame maneuverability is to be such that the cockpit is readily moveable, requiring no more than four (4) persons;  
o) BFS must meet current F-35/Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program flight simulator
       requirements in support of the current A.4 Program Introduction Document;
p) BFS must incorporate the Virtual Input/Output System to provide rapid  
     reconfiguration of the flight simulator cockpit, both with and without the primary  
     host simulation system;
q) Virtual I/O System must provide digital and analog input/output capabilities and 
       electronically connect to all the appropriate cockpit instruments and controls;
r) Virtual I/O System Software must be easily reprogrammed to interface with any aircraft cockpit configuration and any simulation software to support MFS requirements;

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing Security Protection at 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Florida Annexes. The Security  Protection Force service would most likely include the following: A full Security Force service for the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida and Florida Annexes. The term "full Security Force services" refers to duties performed on USAF installations typically performed by military USAF Security Forces. The contractor shall provide a comprehensive security services program for Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida and its associated Florida Annexes. It shall include security management, operations, administration, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except those designated as Government-furnished) to perform all tasks related to a Security Force.  This is not a contract for night watchmen or minimal guard services. It is a contract for a uniformed Security Force that is trained and armed to meet the requirements, capabilities, and quality of USAF standards in accordance with AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-201. All Security Force members will maintain a DoD Secret security clearance.

The work provides for the planning, management, and operation of the security function for the protection of USAF priority and critical resources, government property, force protection, and classified information.  It includes, command and control, security surveillance, security forces response (land and marine), law enforcement patrol, maintaining law and order, anti-terrorism and force protection as defined in AFI 10-245, the administration of entry to the installation and priority resources, crime prevention, security administration (reports and analysis, plans and programs), resource protection (physical and installation security and System Security Integration (SSI)), limited criminal investigation support, security forces training (to include weapons qualification), supply, and other security support services to maintain customers security needs for contingency or launch operations.  

The contractor shall develop and implement an Installation Security Plan in accordance with AFI 31-101 that detects hostile activity, controls entry and access to priority resources, and, if necessary, defeats a hostile force, while adhering to requirements relevant to "arming and use of force" in accordance with AFI 31-207.  The nature of the Security Force mission requires that the contractor have the provisions to ensure continuous security services in the event of work stoppage or labor strikes that degrade the security services function.

The contractor shall respond to all identified security problems on CCAFS.  The contractor shall provide security of the perimeter of CCAFS.  The contractor shall staff certain designated internal secondary perimeter posts for the protection of priority resources.  

Due to the mission of the 45th Space Wing at CCAFS the contractor will need the ability to surge manning for space launch operations, launch vehicle processing, and contingencies (physical security malfunctions/failures, or immediate threat conditions).

The contractor will maintain an alternate CSC.  The CSC will be operated by an armed security force member.  Maintainers of such equipment are required to maintain a DoD Secret security clearance.

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a Security Management Plan (SMP).  This SMP will be submitted to the Security Functional, 45 SFS/S6, for concurrence.  The SMP will specify the Contractor's implementation of security for priority resources.  The SMP shall support the daily operational missions and threats of CCAFS plus the various contingencies to ensure security of priority resources.  The plan shall include the integration of security requirements for resources protection; methodology for expanding the workforce when required to support variable security needs; command, control, and communication procedures for Security Forces; and maintenance of Security Forces personnel qualifications.          

The contractor would maintain public safety and the safety of the workforce.  The contractor would maintain safe and secure operating locations and be flexible and innovative in protecting and preserving physical and environmental assets.  The contractor would professionally manage resources and the infrastructure to ensure sustainability, reliability, energy conservation and cost efficiency of the facilities, systems and equipment at CCAFS.  The contractor would provide facilities support and assure superior customer satisfaction by accomplishing the work described herein within the time limits specified, the constraints present, the schedules and budgets identified by the customer.

Secret facility and safeguarding clearances will be required in the performance of this work. Companies proposing on this acquisition must be U.S. owned and personnel supporting this contract must have a minimum of a Secret Clearance.

After developing a mutually agreed upon contract type vehicle for work performance, the successful offerors will be required to enter into third party agreements with General Dynamics Electric Boat Corporation, PSU/ARL, EG&G. The third party agreements are required as the ESS is only one of the sub-assemblies required for the REML system. The other REML sub-assemblies, namely motor and power converter, are being developed by EB, with PSU/ARL and EG&G acting as subject matter experts for the Government. Thus a free flow of information between all parties is required for successful development and integration of the REML system.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted by industry.  1.  QUESTION:  Which Help Desk is currently being used at Bolling AFB and if one is not being used, is a requirement perhaps to install a Help Desk?

ANSWER:  Bolling Clinic has its own Help Desk.

2.  QUESTION:  Is this market research in preparation for a potential recompete of existing work?  If so, is this the NETCENTS task order that was awarded to Northrup Grumman on 1 Sep 06?

ANSWER:  Yes this is a recompete of existing work.   The incumbent is not Northrop Grumman.

3.  QUESTION:  We understand that AHLTA has experienced performance issues and has not always been well received by the user community.  If a new contract/task order results from your current market research do you contemplate the contractor having an opportunity to make significant improvements to AHLTA to positively impact the user experience or will the resulting contract/task order sustain the current capability and provide user training/support for the current capability?

ANSWER:  No improvements to AHLTA are expected on any Task Order/Contract which may ulitmately be issued.  Any Task Order/Contract will continue current capabilities.  The sources sought synopsis was issued for market research purposes only, and is not a request for proposals (RFP).  An RFP may be issued as a result of this sources sought synopsis.

4.  QUESTION:  What will the relationship with Clinical Information Technology Office (CITPO) be, if any, as they were the guiding agency for the initial deployment and AHLTA is a DOD wide application.

ANSWER:  The contractor will not be expected to have any relationship with CITPO?that is a Service responsibility.
 
5.  QUESTION:  Given that there is Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) work listed, is there going to be the need to interface regularly with the development teams and the other branches or are we speaking about clinic and MTF level flow of operation?

ANSWER:  BPR in this SSS and any contract which may ultimately be issued is directly in reference to AF MTF/clinic workflow and operations.
 
6.  QUESTION:  Are help desk tickets still being run through the local help desks? During the initial implementation tickets were directed to the local help desk and then escalated.

ANSWER:  Yes, Help Desk tickets still originate at the local Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Help Desk level.
 
7.  QUESTION:  What is the scope and level of effort? Are we talking about training entire MTF staffs on application updates, just new hires at each MTF, both or some other combination? The implications of this are huge in terms of the types and volume of staffing.

ANSWER:  Scope of work includes:  training for MTF staff new to the AF, as needed remedial training to all MTF staff, new functionality training to all MTF staff.  Level of effort is all CONUS and OCONUS AF MTFs.
 
8.  QUESTION:  I am assuming that the Air Force is still using the training outline for classroom and on-the-job training and has access to all of the training materials generated by UNISYS and SAIC and intends to use them. Is this correct or is the Air Force looking to develop and new strategy and curriculum?

ANSWER:  AF intends to use CITPO/MHS provided materials.  If additional materials are needed for new functionality and are not provided by CITPO/MHS, AF will develop the materials.
 
9.  QUESTION:  How is sustainment currently being managed? Are there sustainment trainers at the MTFs that will become part of the team, remain seperate or go away?

ANSWER:  Current program provides trainers at AF MTFs with some resource sharing of trainers between facilities.  The team approach for both technical and functional ?care and feeding? of AHLTA is encouraged and supported by the AF.
 
10.  QUESTION:  Has the Air Force set proficiency standards for end users and if so how does the Air Force intend to measure them? Is the Air Force going to use the proficiency standards of the initial deployment or something else?

ANSWER:  No.  No proficiency standards were set as contract performance metric for initial deployment.  AF policy outlines expected 100% utilization of AHLTA.
 
11.  QUESTION:  How does the Air Force intend to manage Information Assurance (IA) and security issues?

ANSWER:  AF requires IA and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) certification and this can only be done once the trainer is at the MTF.  It will be up to the contractor to decide how to staff the sites and for what duration to meet AF requirements for AHLTA training.
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amendmended to provide all potential respondents a curtesy copy of questions recently submitted in response to this solicitation.  They are as follows:  1.)  The solicitation contains no mention  of how the contractor will be paid.  Will FAR 52.232-16 be added to Clauses by  Reference?   A small business may require monthly progress payments.  Payments shall be made in accordance with 52.232-1, 52. 232-25, 52.232-33,and 252.232-7002. 2.)    On pages 12 thru 17 is section 3.3 (Specific Requirements).  It's  obvious that 3.3.1 is in Task 1, and 3.3.3, 3.3.9, and 3.3.10 are in task 2,  but what tasks and CLIN's should 3.3.2, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6, 3.3.7, and 3.3.8  be included in, in the proposal?  Or are 3.3.1 thru 3.3.10 listed only as  topics for individual TEP's, to be delivered later under Task 1?  Tasks  against the basic Statement of Work will be awarded as required on individual  delivery orders.  (See Section I.3 52.216-18). 3.) There is no PRA questionaire attached, per L9.4 (9).  See Amendment 0004. 4.) L.8.(b) and L.9 don't mention the proposal for CLIN 0001, the five year consortium operation.  Should we include this in with the other things  mentioned? A proposal shall be submitted for the basic contract (i.e. est.  hours, labor rates, G&A, material costs (including supporting documentation  for material costs, etc.) as well as separate proposals for tasks 1 and 2.   5.) L.8. and L.9 don't mention the PMP.  Should this be part of the Management  Plan mentioned in L.8.(b), the Management Factor described in L.9.5, or  separate?  If separate, how many copies of it should we be submitting with the  written proposal? This should be submitted as part of the Management Plan  mentioned in L.8.b Additional questions should be addressed to mfranz@pica.army.mil.  Answers will be posted accordingly.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.  The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  Moreover, it is requested the respondees provide information specifically addressing those items/specifications that can not be achieved during this effort.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 2 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements of the current customer?s basis of issue plan (BOIP) of approximately 10 systems.

It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Because this information is sought for future planning purposes, potential offerors are requested to provide price estimates if possible.  These estimates may be general in nature and will be used solely for budget planning purposes. Technical questions should be directed to:  Don Roth at Donald.J.Roth@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Dawn Pottinger at Dawn.R.Pottinger@nasa.gov. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Dawn Pottinger no later than June 22, 2007.  Please reference RFI-2007-Roth in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.  Desired specifications for the system are as follows: The contractor shall build, deliver, and install a turn key “time-domain Pulsed and Chirped (spectroscopic) terahertz computed tomography system” according to the specifications started below. Terahertz nondestructive evaluation is an emerging technology and becoming of increasing importance in the inspection world.  Generation and detection of Pulsed and Chirped T-rays involves femtosecond laser pulses, which power paired photoconductive transducers. Terahertz radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum lying between microwaves and the far-IR. This region has frequencies ranging from 0.1 – 10 THz and wavelengths from 3 mm to 0.03 mm. NASA desires to have a Pulsed and Chirped broadband Terahertz computed tomography system to virtually slice materials and build up 3D volumetric visualizations similar to what is done with Xray computed tomography. NASA’s interest in this technology will relate to characterizing dielectric materials for thermal protection systems (foams and tiles) for exploration and hypersonic systems, seals for Crew Exploration Vehicle, and structural applications such as Kevlar-based COPV (composite overwrap pressure vessel).  Similar to x-ray images, THz wavelengths penetrate through most materials and can easily reveal imperfections such as voids, cracks, and density variations. THz offers some advantages over x-ray including that the radiation is non-ionizing and thus is completely safe.  Example imaging applications include flaw detection in the sprayed-on-foam-insulation (SOFI) for the space shuttle program, detection of threat objects in checked airline baggage and stand-off detection of threat objects in packages or on people.  NASA is open to creative ways to provide 3-D terahertz imaging including but is focused for now on the pulsed and chirped tomographic method (ref. 1) as follows. Mandatory Items: 1. The source should be terahertz broadband capability between 0.1 and 3 THz. Depth and lateral resolution within a cross-sectional slice plane should be 1 mm or better. 2. The source-detector assembly shall be collinear. 3. Pulsed and Chirped probe modes should be available. The chirped probe mode greatly accelerates the speed of the scan according to ref. 1. 4. The system should work in both through-transmission and single-sided back-scatter (pulse-echo) mode, and allow image slices to be formed at the various frequencies in the band.  Additionally, the system should allow operation in a 2-d mode similar so that an image can be obtained similar to a 2-d digital radiograph.  5. Signal-to-noise ratio shall be nominally 100:1 or better at peak frequency and 50:1 at Full-width half max frequency points. 6. In pulsed mode, data acquisition rate can be variable but would need to be as high as 6.4 THz. The waveform time length acquired can be variable but shall be as large 2048 points (320 psec). 7.The sample positioning system shall have stepper motors and controllers capable of 10 micrometer steps in the vertical and horizontal directions and less than or equal to 1 degree of rotation in the plane of the cross-sectional slice. 360 degrees of rotation is desired. 8. The largest practical sample size that can be inspected based on the experience of the vendor / manufacturer can be communicated to NASA. 9. Slice reconstructions should be possible using peak amplitude, peak time, peak phase, peak magnitude, or magnitude and phase as a function of frequency.  The reconstruction time should be optimized. 10. Both terahertz waveform and image slice data should be viewable on the display and control software native to the system, and also exportable as raw data and to various data formats for use with popular 3d visualization programs such as 3D doctor and custom formats to be specified by NASA.  Raw data format specification must be provided so that NASA can write translation programs for use with NASA custom-developed software. 11. The system should be operable with a Windows XP or Windows Vista-based PC of 3 GHz Dual Pentium (or equivalent) or greater. The system software shall be in English. 12. The system shall have 1 terabyte of hard-drive storage capability. 13. Calibration test standards must be provided that demonstrate the spatial resolution in both tomography modes and 2-d mode. 14. Laser safety issues must be specified and recommendations provided. 15. The system shall be demonstrated to meet above specifications on-site at vendor location with NASA representative present.  16. A maintenance and repair contract shall be provided for the first year after acceptance of this system. 17. The offeror shall provide two (2) days of training for two NASA researchers during or immediately following the installation period. 18. The installation shall be completed with four weeks from the time of delivery. 19. Complete documentation (two sets of each of the operation manuals, blueprints, separate components specifications, and troubleshooting manuals), i.e., sufficient information for the Government researcher to fix and troubleshoot problems that are not classified as proprietary issues in order to keep the system functioning. Note: Reference - Wang, S. and Zhang, X-C., Chirped terahertz tomography. J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 (2004).	Specifically see pgs. R18 – R25 dealing with the pulsed and chirped probe modes for the tomography system.

<DESC>The United States Army is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of commercial off-the-shelf IP compatible on the move (OTM) Line of Sight (LOS) radio equipment for use in future forward vehicle, airborne, and manpack.  The radio sh ould support a brigade area of operations (20km x 30km) with approximately 180-280 Radio Sets and ensure connectivity for continuous operations.  Larger areas can be supported by an integrated network of two or more single communities.  The equipment shoul d be jam-resistant, secure, and provide a minimum network capacity of 2 Mbps of near real-time data communication.   It is desirable that the system support larger channel sizes which support higher bandwidths and provide other features appropriate to a ta ctical environment.  It is required that the system use RF frequency bands available to US Department of Defense (DoD) entities for worldwide deployment.  It is desired that the system be capable of using multiple spectrum ranges to ensure maximum flexibil ity in deployment.   All responses must support Type 1 NSA approved encryption either embedded within the radio or by combination with a commercial Inline Network Encryptor (INE) or serial encryptor.  It is desired that this encryptor will support over-the -air-re-keying (OTAR) and is compatible with the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  All over-the-air transmission must support some levels of Transmission Security (TRANSEC) as required by Tactical operations.   Automatic key rollover and remote zeroizati on capability are also required.  Dynamic protocols such as MANET are desirable. The weight of a Radio Set (RS) in manpack or vehicular dismounted configurations, including the receiver/transmitter, antenna, battery box, batteries, Type 1 encryption device, and accessories will not exceed 28 pounds with an objective weight of 14 lbs or  less.  The RS battery power source must support 12 (threshold) to 24 (objective) hours operation.  The weight of an RS in surface vehicle configuration, including the receiver/transmitter, antenna and base, selectable power adapter, resilient mount, , Typ e 1 encryption device, and other accessories will not exceed 52 pounds. The weight of an RS in aircraft configuration, including the receiver/transmitter, antenna, pilot control display panel, airborne power adapter, Type 1 encryption device, and resilient  mount, will not exceed 45 pounds (35 pounds desired).  Power Adapters should operate from primary power source of 24-28 VDC and provide for capability to operate from primary power source of 115 VAC (115/208 VAC desired) 50/60 Hz in selected configuration s.   A summary should be provided of the radio capabilities in the areas of: frequency bands, channel bandwidths, tuning steps, duplexing, frame lengths, smart antenna, Multiple Input Multiple Output (Space Time Coding and Collaborative), adaptive antenna syste m, transmit power, receiver sensitivity, frequency stability, handover, range, data rates, Bit Error Rate (BER), Forward Error Correction (FEC), security/encryption, Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS), Quality of  Service (QoS), throughput and latency for d ifferent applications, multicast, the Physical Layer (PHY) features (e.g. modulations/coding schemes, guard interval, and power control), and the Medium Access Control (MAC) features (e.g. multipoint, mesh-network, etc.).   For the security/encryption capa bility, the response must address conformance to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), conformance to FIPS-197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with key length of 256 bits, key-loading, key ing devices required, Transmission Security (TRANSEC), the embedding of or coupling with a Type 1 encryption device (COMSEC), and any additional features which may address security concerns for a tactical environment.  The response must address form factor  and ability to be used within Army Tactical Vehicles on the m ove, Airborne Platforms, and manpack configurations.   The response must also address the ability to perform automatic relay within the confines of brigade area of operations.   The system software should be field upgradeable. For above features not currently available, please detail upgrade path indicating software or hardware changes required.  Partial responses such as a manpack configuration only are also desirable if the alte rnative configurations are not available. A date for initial delivery of production systems is still to be determined. The response must address the estimated production capacity (per month) which will be available in late 2007.  Interested firms are reque sted to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement no later than 22 June 2007, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Williams, 816-983-3809
<DESC>A Job Ordering Contract (JOC) is an alternative contracting method to fulfill requirements for sustainment, restoration, and modernization (SRM) projects at the installation level (Ft Leavenworth, Kansas military reservation). Work under this contrac t will be accomplished by individual task orders, which will be negotiated and issued on an as-needed basis for a wide range of repair and maintenance requirements within this installation. Each project or job ordered under a JOC is normally comprised of a  number of pre-described and pre-priced tasks listed in the Unit Price Book established for the contract.  This work may include but is not limited to the following: repair or replacement of mechanical, electrical or fire protection and detection systems; concrete; asphalt; repairs related to building renovation or demolition; interior remodeling work including  carpentry, painting, floor and wall covering; renovation of historic structures; repair or replacement of infrastructure systems; correction of drainage problems; repair or upgrade of structural problems, including seismic upgrades; repair or replacement of roofing, siding, windows, doors or other miscellaneous architectural elements, etc.  Work may be accomplished in different types of facilities including: administrative; training; recreational; a maximum security military prison, vehicle maintenance; industrial; warehouses, high security areas, confinement facilities, etc.  JOC contracts are bonded at the contract level rather than by bonding individual task orders. This will require the contractor to provide performance and payment bonds for construction at a dollar amount to be established in the solicitation. This amount i s based on an estimated dollar total of all task orders that may be under construction at any one time. Based on historical usage data, the anticipated bonding level will be approximately $6.0 Million per ordering period.  Because bid bonds are based on the maximum potential amount of the contract, including all option periods, the contractor will need to submit a bid bond with their offer of $3.0 Million.  This project will require a contractor on-call for requirements at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and to have an on site office for the duration of the contract 6 years. There may be dry times of construction and 75% of the work is usually during 4th quarter. Th is acquisition will require a general contract or with experience and expertise capable of managing numerous task orders at the same time, requiring construction scheduling, cost estimating, quality control, and coordination of subcontractors in a wide var iety of construction trades, that have knowledge of working with coefficient 1. OFFERS. Each offeror must submit ten coefficient factors in order to be considered acceptable  (See Section 00800, provision entitled, WORK HOURS.)  It is also estimated that approximately 5% of the work will be accomplished during other than normal work hours. This is only an estimate; the actual. Balance of locations and hours will vary by the in dividual requirements. The government shall in no way be bound by these estimates.  COEF	AMOUNT	LOCATION/HOURS A.	______	USDB DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS B.	______	USDB OUTSIDE NORMAL HOURS C.	______	FAMILY HOUSING DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS D.	______	FAMILY HOUSING OUTSIDE NORMAL WORK HOURS E.	______	ALL OTHER AREAS DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS F.	______	ALL OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE NORMAL WORK HOURS G.	______	EXCAVATION DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS H.	______	EXCAVATION OUTSIDE NORMAL WORK HOURS I.	______	NON-PREPRICED WORK DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS J.	______	NON-PREPRICED WORK OUTSIDE NORMAL WORK HOURS Coefficient factors A. through J. are to be applied to that prepriced work anticipated to be accomplished during the entire contract period. The Offeror shall perform, any or all tasks described in the specifications in accordance with the scope of work fo r individual task orders issued against this con tract for the unit price sum stated in  Unit Price Book multiplied by the City Cost Index and then multiplied by the coefficient stated in the Bidding Schedule. Pricing for all option years will be obtained by applying an economic price adjustment to the b ase year coefficient factors.  Coefficient factors I. and J. are to be applied to any required non-prepriced items. The Offeror shall perform, any or all tasks described in the specifications; at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, during both normal and other than normal hours; in accordance with  the scope of work for individual task orders issued against this contract for the bare costs of non-prepriced items multiplied by the coefficient stated in the Bidding Schedule. There will be no economic price adjustment applied for non-prepriced items. T he same coefficient factors for non-prepriced items will apply for the base year and all option years. Previously non prepriced work items may subsequently be added to the basic tasks defined in Part I, Section 01000. Non prepriced work shall be so noted o n each delivery order. The maximum amount of non-prepriced work in any task order shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total dollar value of the task order, unless waived by appropriate authority.   example below:     Example JOC computation utilizing Contractor supplied Coefficients: L  =  (UPB)x (Cb) x (CCI)x(C2)x(C3)  where&& L    =   Total adjusted line item cost  Cb  =  Coefficient  for the Base Year Cyr1  =  Coefficient for the first Option Year Cyr2  =  Coefficient for the 2nd Option Year Cyr3  =  Coefficient for the 3rd Option year Cyr4  =  Coefficient for the 4th Option year CCI  =  City Cost Index (Kansas City, Kansas) (will always be the same) UPB  =  R.S. Mean Unit Price Book (Bare Costs) (New update with each option year) C2  =  Location and Hours - Coefficient C3  =  Non-prepriced work  Coefficient (C3 is used only when the item cannot be found in the UPB) EXAMPLE 1 :   Base year, price book ($100), inside the USDB,  Normal hours,  Prepriced work. (UPB)x (Cb)x(CCI)x(C2)x(C3)  =   L ($100)x(1.1)x(.942)x(1.15)x(1.0)  =   $119.16 EXAMPLE  2:   	Option year 1,  price book ($100),  inside the USDB, outside Normal Hours, Non prepriced work. (UPB)x (Cb)x(CCI)x(C2)x(C3)  =   L ($100)x(1.12)x(.942)x(1.155)x(1.1)  =   $134.04 Past performance will be an evaluation factor.  We would like a letter or email by 7 June 2007 addressing knowledge of JOC experience, bonding limits, and qualifications. Also the incumbent JOC contract will still be active until the end of FY 08 and all task orders during that period will be competed b etween both contractors.

<SUBJECT>B -- Clinical Site Monitoring of the CDC Safety and Efficacy Trails for Truvada in Botswana and Tenofovir in Thailand
<DESC>In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302(1), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source, cost-plus-fixed fee modification under contract 200-2005-13112  to the incumbenant contractor, Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) in Wilmington, NC.  The original requirement was competed in July 2005 and awarded to PPD.  For continuity and consistency of the research projects, monitoring and training, it is imperative that PPD continue to provide the required services.  PPD has the unique capability and specialized experience to perform and complete the existing monitoring services in a timely and scientifically sound manner. Utilizing another contractor at this juncture, would render the work performed to date scientifically questionable and it would impede the successful completion of the research being conducted. The government will experience tremendous cost savings if PPD continues to perform under this contract. The trials will not have to end pre-maturely and start up costs will not be incurred.  
 
The original contract consisted of:

Phases I.  
           Task 1.  Study and Protocol Planning
           Task 2.  Regulatory Activities
           Task 3.  Site Monitoring and Management
           Task 4.  Site Staff Training
           Task 5.  Project Management and Team Training

Phase II. 
           Task 1.  Study and Protocol Planning
           Task 2.  Regulatory Activities
           Task 3.  Site Monitoring and Management
           Task 4.  Site Staff Training
           Task 5.  Project Management and Team Training

Phase III.
           Task 1.  Regulatory Activities
           Task 2.  Site Monitoring and Mangement
           Task 3.  Site Staff Training
           Task 4.  Project Management and Team Training  

At the conclusion of the Phase I, Phases II and III were revised and incorporated into the existing contract as modification one.  

Since 2005 CDC has funded BOTUSA, collaboration between the Government of Botswana, TUC, Thailand and CDC, to conduct safety and efficiency trials to determine whether ART taken as PrEP is safe on a long-term basis and whether it reduces the rate of acquisition of HIV infection.  In Botswana, the trial is being conducted among heterosexually active young adult men and women in Gaborone and Francistown. In Thailand, the trial is enrolling injection drug users at 17 drug treatment clinics in Bangkok. The agent chosen for the study in Thailand is Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF). The Thailand study will increase the cohort size by 400 participants and extend the timeframe for participation in the study. TDF was the agent initially chosen for the study in Botswana.  However, six months into the study the decision was made to change the study drug to Truvada? which is a combination of TDF and emtricitabine (FTC).  Participants in both studies are randomized to receive either study drug or its placebo and are followed for any adverse effects of the agent, any changes in their sexual or injection drug risk behavior, and HIV incidence. Results of this study will determine whether TDF or Truvada? is safe and effective as long-term prophylaxis against HIV infection among those exposed sexually or by injection drug use, in addition to standard risk reduction methods. The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, facilities, supplies, materials, equipment, transportation, and travel necessary to carry out the follow up of the AIDSVAX? B/E vaccine trial cohort. 

The existing contract will be modified to incorporate the research activity revisions for Phase III and to add an additional Phase IV.  These revisions will extend the monitoring and training components of the existing contract by sixteen months (16) months.

		C.  The contractor will maintain monthly telephone contacts with study 			sites throughout the trials and generate brief telephone reports of verbal c			correspondence with sites to monitor for compliance with study 				procedures.  
		D.  The contractor will conduct closeout visits at each of the two sites.  			Each closeout visit is assumed to take 3-4 days for preparation, travel, on-			site activities and report writing. 
		
		Task 3.  Site Staff Training
 
		A. The contractor shall provide GCP-related training to site staff as 			indicated by results of monitoring visits.

		B.  The contractor shall generate quarterly written project status reports for 		each CDC-funded site in a mutually agreed-upon format.  
		C.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing program-specific 			training to contractor personnel assigned to the study.

<SUBJECT>U -- Geriatric Education Center National Technical Assistance Center
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the Case Western University (CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio. This contract, authorized by Title VII,
Section 753(a), of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, is needed to establish a Geriatric Education Centers National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC). The CWRU is the lead organization for the data management and evaluation task force for the National Association of Geriatric Education Centers. The CWRU has developed a data management system to provide these services. Any other organization would require an exorbitant amount of time and funds to reproduce the CWRU data management system. The CWRU is uniquely capable and has the personnel experience and information system resources to carry out all the tasks of this requirement. The center will serve as a primary focal point to provide technical assistance in the areas of data collection tools, methods, systems and evaluation with a goal to evaluate tertiary outcomes (i.e., the effect of geriatric education and training on patients).  The CWRU is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the services without a substantial duplication of cost to the Government which would not be expected to be recovered through competition. This justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a solicitation.  A one (1) year contract with a base year and four (4) option years is planned.

<SUBJECT>A -- RFI-Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT)-Advanced Rocket Propullsion Plan (ARPP)
<DESC>1.      The attached Supplemental Package supports the advanced synopsis for the IHPRPT RFI. This package provides information and guidelines for preparing Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs). This RFI request is open to all appropriate organizations, individuals, and contractors.  Any interested party not previously associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following: The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Material Command FAR Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to restricted information which will contain key data, such as goals and baselines. 

2.  Synopsis:	
This is not a Request for Proposal but is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program is a DoD/NASA/industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over the 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  The program is structured in three phases, with a nominal Phase III completion date of 2010.  The information provided through the Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs) will be used to review and revise the Government Rocket Propulsion Plan (GRPP) and to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  A review team comprised of DoD and NASA representatives will review the ARPPs submitted by the United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion Industry applicable to the mission application areas stated below.  U.S. Rocket Propulsion Industry companies who participate in this program must develop or update ARPPs mapping out their recent past, on-going and planned rocket propulsion research and development (R&D) efforts, consistent with the IHPRPT program goals. 

3.    The Government is interested in obtaining technical and programmatic information from industry in the form of ARPPs regarding how future goals for the IHPRPT program may be met.  The propulsion application areas of interest are Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT and missile defense), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion mission application areas.  The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package for the mission application areas relative to the IHPRPT efforts.  A contractor who currently does not have an ARPP, but wishes to respond to the RFI must as a minimum, generate an ARPP that will satisfy all IHPRPT goals applicable to at least one propulsion system type and phase within an application area.  Also as part of the ARPP the plan to use small business innovative research organizations is appropriate is requested.

4.    The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information requested under this RFI.  This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, but a request for information only. Detailed supplemental packages Section I, Section II, III, and Section VI  are attached, Section IV, and V are available upon request. Those who have not previously been associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following:  The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command FAR supplement, Subpart 5327.90, Foreign Disclosure.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package containing restricted information.  If you are registered in the CCR, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package; please contact contracting POC listed in Paragraph 6 of this notice. Submitters are advised that representatives from DoD and NASA, as well as employees of Aerospace Corporation; SPARTA Inc.; Jackson and Tull Inc.; Sverdrup, Inc.; Nyma Inc.; Centech Group Inc.. and others may assist the government as advisors in reviewing the ARPPs.  The government will ensure the required non-disclosure agreements are in place prior to allowing the support contractors to review the ARPPs.  Any objection to the disclosure of information to these non-government advisors should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of documents and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  The government ARPP review team will provide written comments to each contractor specifically in the following areas: completeness, strengths, weaknesses, cost and probability of successful completion (program management and technical approach).  The comments will be based on the following: Does the ARPP address all the IHPRPT goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement?  Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI and Supplemental Package?  Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized?  Oral presentations of the ARPPs will be scheduled to occur at each respective responder?s facility.

5.    The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area(s); Boost and Orbit Transfer, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  The contractor may propose work in one or all application areas, but must address all goals (referenced in the supplemental package) and remaining phases within any proposed application area for each type of propulsion system discussed.  New, innovative concepts and processes are encouraged.  It is the intent of the government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.

We request you send one original hard copy and subsequent electronic copies as indicated below, to each of the principle government organizations participating in the review.  They are listed as follows with the preferred number of copies, addressee and address (Refer to Supplemental Information Section I for ARPP content and guidelines).

These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  This sole source is to prevent a lapse in service for a period of performance which is estimated to extend from a minimum of three months to a maximum of six months.  The estimated start date is July 27, 2007 and the estimated maximum end date is January 26, 2008.   The sole source is to prevent a lapse in service during negotiation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services.  RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 was posted to www.fbo.gov on March 2, 2007.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the three to six month period while negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247 are active.  Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the Contract Specialist by July 9, 2007, at 4PM EST. All inquires must be submitted in writing; telephone inquiries will not be accepted, nor written responses received after July 9, 2007.

<SUBJECT>--Future Combat Systems (FCS) Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)Development Request for Information (RFI) Only
<DESC>The following represents a notice placed by the US Army on behalf of The Boeing Company in support of Boeing's role as Lead Systems Integrator for the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. THis does not represent a present or future Government procire ment. Contact the Boeing POC listed in the message below, not the US Government POC listed on this announcement.  The Boeing Company, in conjunction with our partner Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), together acting as Future Combat Systems (FCS) Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) for the Army, is pleased to announce a new Request for Information for n etwork technologies related to networked voice communications. FCS is a networked 'system of systems.'  It utilizes advanced communications and technologies to link soldiers with unmanned air platforms, ground platforms, and sensors.  The FCS network is a mobile ad hoc network that will be primarily IP based, but will also support legacy technologies with high levels of information assurance. In addition to this RFI effort, the FCS LSI is working on different but related networking technologies that may impact voice performance.  The LSI has the task to determine the tolerable voice quality limits for MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) performance p arameters in terms of delay, packet-loss, and jitter for end-to-end voice packet transportation.  A part of this effort takes into account other sources of voice quality degradations stemming from acoustic design (handset/headset/microphone etc.) and envir onmental noise (such as inside a manned combat vehicle).  In addition, the Quality-of-Service design in the FCS network will provide some degree of preferential treatment (in terms of per hop behavior) to voice packets from the QoS assurance and contention  perspective in contrast with other data and media services sharing the converged FCS IP network. Boeing is sending out this RFI to identify and understand ongoing work in networking technologies with the focus on fields that may assist the LSI's SDSI (Software and Distributed Systems Integration) IPT in the following tasks as applied to tactical MANET  networks: o	VoIP Applications o	Low bit rate CODECs for deployment in MANET environment o	Loss Concealment Techniques o	Multicast applications The deadline for RFI package submittal is 15 August 2007.  Information contained in the RFI response may be utilized for future FCS Requests for Proposals. Interested parties are hereby requested to respond within 45 days of this announcement.  Please refer to the FCS Home Page (FCS Bid Opportunities) for announcement details at http://www.boeing.com/fcs.

<DESC>Express Delivery Services

I.  BACKGROUND

CDC?s use of Express Delivery Services has grown substantially over the years.  CDC shipments have increased as have the dollars spent on such services.  The receipt and payment of Express Delivery Service Invoices was initially done in house when the volume of CDC shipments was much more manageable.  In 1993, the Financial Management Office sought a vendor who would support an increasing need to properly manage all of CDC?s Express Delivery Service Needs.  This vendor was required to receive all of CDC?s express delivery service invoices thru EDI, properly code the invoices and related shipments for proper payment and accounting, and also audit the rates charged by the service provider to see that CDC is not being overcharged.  The vendor would also seek credits on CDC?s behalf for shipments that were not made in a timely manner.  The vendor would have to perform these functions timely to ensure that invoice payments were not delayed which could result in interest penalty payments being made.

II.  PURPOSE

The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of a vendor who can process all express delivery service payments for CDC?s Financial Management Office.  The vendor would need to effectively and accurately receive and transmit billing information, identify account numbers that would match up with common accounting numbers (CAN), generate reports, assemble all data and submit an electronic payment file that can be easily uploaded into our Payables module of CDC?s Oracle based Financial System called UFMS.  
    
III.  SCOPE OF WORK:

The vendor shall provide all the labor and material necessary to accomplish the tasks for the express delivery services for the Financial Management Office (FMO) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

4.	Enter the manual, automated and unidentified shipments.

5.	Provide detailed reports showing shipment details.

6.	Adjust data when and where applicable for over shipments, unacceptable shipments, and errors.

7.	Merge data from the EDI and manual invoices to prepare for payment.

8.	Transmit files to CDC for upload into CDC?s accounting system, namely UFMS no later than 21 days after receipt of invoice from the shipping company. 

9.	Prepare and transmit remittance files, non-pay files and any other files required by the shipping company.

VI.	PROJECT OFFICER

Curtis Meusel will be the Project Officer.  Upon award, all questions regarding the technical aspects of this order shall be referred to the Project Officer.  

VII.  MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF VENDOR OR VENDOR REPRESENTATIVE

CDC will need to receive a flat file from the vendor.  CDC will provide the flat file format.  The vendor will need to provide all of the accounting information shown in the format including fiscal year (FY) and common accounting numbers.

Vendor needs to check express delivery service invoices for pricing discrepancies.  A one hundred percent audit is required of all shipping charges to ensure that CDC was billed fairly and billed at the government rate. 

CDC wants access to the data.  CDC also needs to have the capability of reviewing and querying reports on line and creating adhoc reports.  

Allow CDC CIO?s to access the data via Internet. 

Generate and send email messages to cost centers for reconciliation.  Information should provide all relevant shipping information such as account numbers, shipping numbers, complete shipping information for the sender and receiver including name and address and proof of delivery.  

VIII.  DELIVERABLES

Flat file from vendor to upload into UFMS.     

IX.  PAYMENT TERMS

Payment will be made thirty days following receipt/acceptance of services by the Project Officer identified herein or receipt of proper invoice to address shown in block 21 of purchase order, whichever is later.  

X.  TECHNICAL APPROACH AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG) intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the acquisition of a software module to manage the DD Form 1423 Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) associated with the various contracts of the Program.   Management of the data includes scanning, data input, storage, modification, reproduction, automation, notification, tracking, reporting, and statuses of CDRLs, Data Item Descriptions, and Logistics, Engineering, and Security data submittals. More specific functions would include: 

-An Integrated DID repository
-Generation of CDRL 1423 forms 
-Managing CLINS, Mods, and CDRL versions
-Linking CDRL deliveries to contract milestones
-Generating recurring CDRL delivery schedules
-Forecasting CDRL receipts via calendar
-Online CDRL submittal portals for vendors
-Managing data separation security
-Auto-route CDRL submittals for approval
-Auto-alert reviewers via e-mail

25 User Licenses of the Software, Initial User Training, Installation, and Operational Services are required.  Licensing will be flexible enough for multiple users from different elements of the CM Program to make use of.  For example: AVE I1 and GOE I1 users could use the system simultaneously and when CDRL requirements draw down at the end of their contracts, Mission Data users could begin using the system.  

Operational services would include: mapping and migrating our legacy data to the data base environment, tailoring data items (contracts, CDRLs, documents, action items, meetings, etc.) to presentation formats, developing data reports to our formats, building workflow template library for use in common review processes, developing specific business rules for automatic functions, and establishing program metrics and scorecards.

The software program must address standardization, compatibility, maintainability, and interoperability issues associated with specific Network configuration requirements in which they will be deployed (Network Modular Automation 2000/XP).

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK (SOW):  EMBANKMENT MATERIAL TO RAISE USIBWC LEVEES FROM INTERNATIONAL DAM TO RIVERSIDE DAM.  I.  PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many Texas cities including El Paso, Presidio, McAllen-Mission, Harlingen, and Brownsville.  FEMA decertification of the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) levees in El Paso County, TX, in February 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  The USIBWC plans to raise approximately nine (9) miles of USIBWC levees in El Paso County to meet the minimum 3 feet of freeboard criteria.  This will enable USIBWC to certify the reach from International Dam to Riverside Dam, a portion of the Rio Grande Rectification Project before the end of calendar year 2007.  II.  DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 165,000 tons of embankment material to be delivered on USIBWC’s levees from International Dam to Riverside Dam.  All materials furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in this SOW.  The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.  III.  PROJECT LOCATION:  The Rio Grande Rectification Project is located along the Rio Grande in El Paso and Hudspeth Counties.  For this SOW, material will only be delivered on USIBWC levees in El Paso County.  Locations of these levees are shown on attached maps (available from USIBWC).  IV.  MATERIALS:  Embankment material shall consist of impervious materials classified in accordance with ASTM International, ASTM D 2487 as lean clay (CL), low plasticity silt (ML), sand containing more than 30 percent of clay (SC), and borderline clay and silt (CL-ML).  The material shall be free from: roots and other organic matter; contamination from hazardous, toxic or radiological substances; trash; debris; and frozen materials.  The material shall be such as to produce a stable embankment and shall have a minimum Plasticity Index (PI) of eight (8) and a maximum Plasticity Index (PI) of 30.  V.  MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS:  Measurement of embankment material shall be measured by the ton of 2,000 pounds dry weight in vehicles.  The Contractor shall provide a standard platform truck scale conforming to the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 520 “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.”  The dry weight will be determined by deducting the weight of the moisture in the material at the time of weighing from the gross weight of the material.  The moisture in the material will be determined in accordance with Test Method Tex 103-E at least once each day.  Prior to first delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officers’ Representative (COR), a written report of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of Item 520.  When inaccuracy or inadequacy is discovered, scale use will not be resumed until corrective measure has been completed and/or the scales calibrated as provided by Item 520.  Any electronic device that has been adapted for weighing that meets the calibration requirement is acceptable.  As loads are delivered, loading tickets shall be furnished to the COR.  VI.  PAYMENT:  Payment for furnishing, delivering, weighing, and testing embankment material in accordance with this Scope of Work and measured as provided under Section IV “Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price per ton for embankment material.  When requesting payment, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer receipted (by USIBWC Inspectors or COR), and certified (by the Contractor) weight tickets for each delivery load of material.  VII.  SAMPLING AND TESTING:  A.  The Contractor shall be responsible for assuring that all embankment material delivered to the job site meets the specified requirements in Section IV “Materials.”  The Contractor shall establish a sampling and testing program to include gradation, plasticity index, and moisture content testing to assure compliance of materials.  Testing of all material shall be in accordance with the following Texas Department of Transportation standard laboratory test procedures:  Moisture Content Tex-103-E, Sieve Analysis	Tex-110-E, and Plasticity Index Tex-106-E.  B.  Frequency of Testing:  The Contractor shall:  (a) test once prior to initial delivery and every two weeks for the duration of the project for gradation and plasticity index (Contractor is to notify the COR at least three (3) days prior to taking samples for gradations and plasticity index); and (b) tests for moisture content at least once each delivery day.  The Contractor may test more frequently for gradation and plasticity index to assure material complies with the Scope of Work.  C.  Inspection:  Embankment material the Contractor proposes to furnish shall be available for inspection by the COR.  All sources or stockpiles the Contractor uses to supply materials for the contract shall be subject to inspection and approval by the COR for the duration of the contract.  D.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
(ii)  Solicitation IBM07Q0008 is being issued in a Request for Quotes format.  
(iii)  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-15.  
(iv)  IBM07Q0008 is based upon unrestricted competition - offers will be accepted from all responsible sources.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 212321 for construction san and gravel mining, with a corresponding small business size standard of 500 employees.  All offerors must disclose their appropriate size standard in the submitted quotation(s) in order for the quotation to be considered responsive to this solicitation.  
(v) Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001, Flexible Base Material, Estimated Quantity 24,000 tons, Unit Price and Total Cost are to be shown in proposals responding to this solicitation.  Unit prices quoted shall be per ton and include hauling.  All material furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in the scope of work.  
(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK (SOW):  I.  PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many Texas cities including El Paso, Presidio, McAllen-Mission, Harlingen, and Brownsville.  FEMA decertification of USIBWC levees in El Paso County, TX, in February 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  The USIBWC plans on raising approximately 8 miles of USIBWC levees, within a 12 mile reach between International Dam and Riverside Dam in the Rectification Project within El Paso County to meet the minimum 3 feet of freeboard criteria.  This will enable USIBWC to partially certify this reach in the before the end of calendar year 2007.  Because the levees serve as access and maintenance roads along the floodplain and given that the embankment material required for raising the levees does not provide a durable driving surface, a proper surfacing material must placed on the levees in areas where they will be raised.  II.  DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 24,000 tons of flexible base material to be delivered on USIBWC’s levees between International Dam and Riverside Dam.  This material will be used as surfacing material for USIBWC levees.  All materials furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in this Scope of Work.  The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.  III.  PROJECT LOCATION:  The Rio Grande Rectification Project is located along the Rio Grande in El Paso and Hudspeth Counties.  For this Scope of Work, material will only be delivered on USIBWC levees in El Paso County.  Locations of these levees are shown on maps available from USIBC upon request.  IV.  MATERIALS:  The Contractor shall provide flexible base materials in accordance with the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 247 Flexible Base, Type A Grade 6.  Physical Requirements:  Type A – Material shall be crushed stone.  Grade 6:  Grading Requirements are U.S. Standard Sieve Size 1” Percent Retained 0; U.S. Standard Sieve Size ¾” Percent Retained 0-15; U.S. Standard Sieve Size No. 4 Percent Retained 45-75; U.S. Standard Sieve Size No. 40 Percent Retained 60-85;  Max Liquid Limit	40; and Max Plasticity Index	12.  V.  MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS:  Measurement will be by the ton of 2,000 pounds dry weight in vehicles.  The Contractor shall provide a standard platform truck scale conforming to the requirements of “Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges” for Item 520 “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.”  The dry weight will be determined by deducting the weight of the moisture in the material at the time of weighing from the gross weight of the material.  The moisture in the material will be determined in accordance with Test Method Tex 103-E at least once each day.  Prior to first delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officers’ Representative (COR), a written report of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of Item 520.  When inaccuracy or inadequacy is discovered, scale use will not be resumed until corrective measure has been completed and/or the scales calibrated as provided by Item 520.  Any electronic device that has been adapted for weighing that meets the calibration requirement is acceptable.  As loads are delivered, certified weight tickets for each delivery load shall be furnished to the COR.  VI.  PAYMENT:  Payment for furnishing, delivering, weighing, and testing flexible base material in accordance with this Scope of Work and measured as provided under Section IV “Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price per ton bid price.  When requesting payment, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer receipted (by USIBWC Inspectors) and certified (by the Contractor) weight tickets for each delivery load of flexible base material.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation Number N61339-07-T-0007  and is hereby issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and proposals being requested.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, ?Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.? This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 511210.  Small Business size standard is $21M.

Background:  Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide SCORM Test Track for Naval Education and Training Command (NETC).  NAWCTSD intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Ructici Software.  Ructici Software is the developer of SCORM Engine used to display training content to students within the Integrated Learning Environment (ILE).  NETC has a number of internal and contracted developers to produce training content, all of which needs to be validated by a Naval Education and Training Personnel Development and Technology Center (NETPDTC) staff member.  Content is reviewed by NETPDTC staff members and sent back to the developer for correction.  Without a way for the developer to test the content in the ILE, the developer must blindly change the content and resubmit it, resulting in a costly and time consuming feedback loop.  SCORM Test Track provides a way to simulate Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformant content's execution in the ILE, thus closing the inefficient feedback loop.

This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business manufacturer under the NAICS code identified above.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Zeta Potential Particle Characterization Instrument to be used in the Polymers Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:

Line Item 0001:  The Contractor shall furnish One (1) Each, imaging instrument for particle characterization of zeta potential.

The Contractor shall provide an imaging instrument for accurate particle characterization of zeta potential, for colloidal particles (ranging from 20 nm to 10 microns in diameter) in dilute aqueous suspension (particle mass fraction 10 to the negative 8 power to 10 to the negative 3 power).

The instrument must meet the following specifications:

1)	Zeta potential
- Zeta potential (and electro-phoretic mobility) of suspended particles shall be measured by visual and computer image analysis of such particles that are illuminated by bright or dark field lighting, viewed by high-resolution video optical microscopy.  The hydrodynamic flow of the fluid by electro-osmosis must be negligible at the image plane (for dilute suspensions of small isolated particles).  Zeta potential measurement range:     negative 200 to plus 200 milliVolts.  
2)	Optical configurations
The light source, sample chamber and image collection should be mounted onto a single frame that facilitates component alignment and focus. 
Light sources: 
- A broad spectrum white-light illumination (for bright field operation) and 
- A laser, which may be of any visible wavelength, or a narrow spectrum long life blue-light LED for dark field operation. The laser or LED must be of sufficient power for low noise images of particles, such as 20 nm polystyrene spheres.  
- Both sources should have adjustable angle and position, so that the image can be optimized. 
Collection optics: 
- Image data collected by a microscope objective mounted on a tube to a ccd video-rate camera.  Adjustable micrometer position (or optics or sample cell), so that the image can be focused on the plane of zero endosmotic flow.
- Progressive-scan monochrome or color ccd camera, with at least 1300 x 1000 resolution, 30 Hz minimum full-frame acquisition rate.
3)	Sample cell
- The sample cell should be designed for quick removal for cleaning or replacement, preferably without the need for recalibration.  Two sample cells should be provided.  
- Sample liquid is held in a rectangular or cylindrical tube of uniform cross-section, and minimum dimension approximately 1 to 3 millimeters.  
- 5 mm tube length minimum.
- Electrodes at both ends of the tube to apply a voltage across the tube length, with electric field strength along the tube ranging from 0 to 100 V/cm.
- 5 mL or greater sample liquid volume.
- Probes to measure liquid pH, specific conductivity, and temperature, providing an output record of these three parameters accompanying each zeta potential measurement. 
- System parameters (applied electric field, T, pH and concentration) are controlled on command, e.g., by pumping liquid of controlled T, pH and concentration into the cell.   
- The sample cell and electrodes should be for use at T ranging from 2 to 60 degrees C and pH ranging from 2 to 12.  
4)	Multipurpose titrator
- For pH or conductivity titrations, the pH and conductivity are measured directly by probes.
- Mixtures may be formulated by dispensing (i.e. pumping) up to at least 3 stock solutions to be mixed with the sample.  The minimum amount that can be pumped should be 50 microLiters or less.   
- Replaceable sample tubing.
5)	Zeta Potential Standard Material
- A zeta potential standard material.  Reproducible measurement of this standard to within plus or minus 10 percent, 95 percent confidence.  
- Reference measurement report of the standard from the Contractor.
6)	Instrument control and image analysis software
- Updates when available.
- Real-time analysis, tabulation and storage of data, including analysis of trends and curve plotting.  Real-time report during titration.  
- Image analysis software for particle size and shape measurement, particle identification and real-time tracking. 
- Image capture and storage shall be manual or automatic.
7)	Computer interface

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received, revise the scope of work, change estimated quantities and notify prospective quoters of access maps with revised routes as well as figures with approximate quantities and placement along the levee.  
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (Q&A):
Q:  I do have a couple of questions to ask before proceeding.  I talked to our prepresentative that visited during the site visit.  He mentioned that since there were several questions in place, the bid submittal cut-off date may be delayed to Friday, May 4th?
A:  The only questions received in writing were from AIW, Inc.  The deadline for receipt of quotes was extended to May 7,2007 and is extended by this amendment to the solicitation until May 8, 2007.  
Q:  If possible, I would appreciate it if you answer some of the questions in mind.  According to the section II DESCRIPTION, it states ?The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.?  As a contractor, I have two material locations at different ends of the project (the product is from the same company, just different quarries).  To save money for USIBWC, is it possible to use the two material locations or does it ?have? to be from one location throughout the project?  This will lower the amount of shipping the product in a drastic manner.  
A:  Up to three sites may be used, see the revised SCOPE OF WORK for changes to sections II DESCRIPTION, VII MEASUREMENT OF MATERIAL, and VIII SUBMITTALS in this amendment.  
Q:  Another question that I feel should be addressed is that at Chihuahita access location, the trucks will be required to cross railroad tracks.  In that event, since there will be a lot of truck traffic, the trucks are required to have a ?flagger? from the Railroad company to be on-site to let the trucks cross over the tracks.  This in turn may take time to register with the RR and get a ?flagger? out on location (we have run into this problem in the past).  Do we (contractor) factor into the price of a the ?flagger? in our quote or will USIBWC provide that?  
A:  The American Dam Project Office will provide the necessary flagmen during the delivery of the material through the Chihuahuita Railroad crossing.  
Q:  Last questions:  If possible, is there a breakdown of how much material will be delivered to each access location?
A:  The estimated quantity for embankment material has been revised, see SCOPE OF WORK for changes to section II DESCRIPTION and III PROJECT LOCATION.  
(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK:  
(II)  DESCRIPTION, Change the first sentence to read:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 50,000 tons to be delivered on USIBWC levees from International Dam to Riverside Dam.  Change the last sentence to read:  The material shall be furnished from no more than three material sources/borrow sites and/or quarries throughout the duration of the contract.  Add the following at the end of the section:  A table is available, upon request, with the approximate tons of embankment material per mile, including the approximate distance from beginning of Chamizal Channel (Upstream Mile No.), and approximate geographic location.   
(III)  PROJECT LOCATION, Add the following sentences:  Maps showing areas to be filled are available upon request from USIBWC.  These maps include all areas to be filled downstream of the Chamizal Channel only, and do not include the reach between Chamizal Channel to International dam.  Estimated length of levee needing fill in the areas is 0.5 miles.  No fill will be placed along Chamizal Channel.  
(V) MEASUREMENT OF MATERIAL, Second paragraph, revise the first sentence to read:  Prior to the first delivery and for each material source, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) written reports of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of

QUESTION:  Due to the short timeframe for our applications chemists to purchase relevant chemicals, run data, and supply a report for this requirement, is it possible that we provide this data at instrument installation/acceptance?  If not, is it possible to extend the solicitation to give our applications chemists ample time to provide data?

RESPONSE:  If the required data cannot be provided within the solicitation period, NIST is willing to consider other data that addresses sensitivity, as long as the technical procedure utilized by the vendor for determining the data is adequately documented and described.
