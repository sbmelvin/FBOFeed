<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />The Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Program Executive Office for Communications (PEO-COMMS), Program Management Office Mobility, Fort Meade, Maryland, in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), will host Industry Days Tuesday thru Thursday, 12-14 June 2012. The purpose of this unclassified conference is to enable the Department of Defense (DOD) representatives to obtain information from industry experts on the need to provide an enterprise solution that will handle Mobile Device Management (MDM) and provide a Mobile Application Store (MAS) best commercial practices and how industry might best meet DOD needs. This information will be used by DOD to better understand industry's ability to support a core set of MDM/MAS user needs and user-selectable enhancements. This information will be fundamental to shaping DOD's future Mobility efforts.
<p><strong><br />Background</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</strong> capability should provide the application and user level "traffic cop," to enforce policy for network and end devices. The MDM institutes the policy, security and permissions that define the functions the user is enabled to conduct on the mobile device. This capability ensures the security of the entire user community is not compromised by an incorrectly configured device. A unified MDM architecture secures, monitors, manages, and supports accredited mobile devices across a range of DoD environments. This allows for malware detection and policy control of the devices. MDM also supports over-the-air electronic software distribution (ESD) of applications, remote data-wipe capabilities, remote device configuration management, and asset/property management capabilities protect against key and data compromise.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mobile Application Store (MAS)</strong> capability is an online digital electronic software distribution (ESD) system usually part of the MDM. Obtaining user application permission rights from the MDM, the MAS can deliver, update and delete applications on the mobile device without the mobile device user having to return the device for service. The MAS operates in conjunction with the MDM system. The objective of an Enterprise MAS is to optimize the functionality and distribution of mobile applications to Mobile Devices while minimizing replication, cost, and downtime. The MAS depends upon the MDM for identification of new, removed, or changed mobile devices to support the PMO Mobility function. Certification and Accreditation of mobile applications will use a distributed process to facilitate entry into the storefront.</p>
<p>DISA is requesting information to determine sources with core competencies and demonstrated experience in developing and sustaining both a MDM and MAS that has, but is not limited to the following capabilities.</p>
<p>&bull; Software Distribution - The ability to manage and support mobile application use including deploy, install, update, delete or block.<br />&bull; Policy Management - Development, control and operations of DoD enterprise mobile access, connectivity, and security policy. <br />&bull; Inventory Management - Beyond hardware inventory management, this includes provisioning and support. <br />&bull; Security Management - The implementation and enforcement of DoD-level device security, authentication and encryption.</p>
<p>To focus the scope of this conference, all interested parties are requested to provide written responses to the associated key questions listed below. DISA requests written responses to the questions be submitted in advance via e-mail to <a href="mailto:jonathan.i.walker.civ@mail.mil">jonathan.i.walker.civ@mail.mil</a>&nbsp;and <a href="mailto:julie.j.bryant.civ@mail.mil">julie.j.bryant.civ@mail.mil</a>&nbsp;no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) Thursday, June 7, 2012. All submissions must be in PDF and MS Excel format as outlined in Vendor Response Sheet_v7. Early receipt of the responses will allow DOD representatives time to review information prior to Industry Days and use the one-on-one session more efficiently. Updates to responses, as needed, can be made and brought to the conference for one-on-one discussions. However, the submissions on June 7, 2012 will be reviewed prior to Industry Days, so all changes should be clearly marked. Industry Day participants are also required to bring six (6) hard copies of responses to RFI questions for distribution during the one-on-one session for the use of government teams.</p>
<p>Specific contracting opportunities are not available and will not be discussed at this conference. This conference's purpose is for the Government to better understand the ability for the MDM/MAS industry to support DOD users' capability needs. Therefore, the conference agenda is primarily allocated to government questioning.</p>
<p>The MDM/MAS Industry Days will be held on Tuesday 12 June 2012, Wednesday 13 June 2012, and Thursday 14 June 2012 at the MITRE Corporation-Annapolis Junction (Meade). The address is, 300 Sentinel Drive, 6FD127, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701 (<a href="http://mitre.org/about/locations/md_annapolis_junction.html">http://mitre.org/about/locations/md_annapolis_junction.html</a>). Parking (deck) is available adjacent to the facility. This meeting is UNCLASSIFIED; no visit request is required. Attendees should arrive by 7:30 a.m. EST for check-in and registration at the MITRE facility on their scheduled one-on-one conference day. No registration for one-on-one conferences will be made during the conference. The conference will begin promptly at 8:00 a.m. EST. Food will not be provided, so plan accordingly.</p>
<p>The conference will consist of a morning overview session each day, beginning at 8:00 a.m. EST and will conclude at approximately 9:15 a.m. EST. Government representatives will provide introductory remarks and address various topics, including recent DOD Mobility activities, the conference agenda and ground rules. On their given day, up to two company representatives will have the opportunity to attend a morning session and a private one-on-one session.</p>
<p>Attendees are expected to be MDM/MAS operations, sales, and technical staff that can answer the specific RFI questions. In order to accommodate the large number of responses, the morning Introduction and Plenary Session will be duplicated on all three days, 12-14 June 2012. Following the morning sessions, beginning at 9:15 am, we will conduct 45-minute one-on-one government-industry sessions. Representatives are required to only attend the morning Introductory and Plenary Session that coincides with their scheduled one-on-one session. Schedules will be enforced, and the first 30 minutes will involve questioning by the government to better understand company RFI responses. The final 15 minutes will be set aside to allow each company to either elaborate on previously discussed points or to offer other industry insights regarding MDM/MAS. Sales pitches or marketing material will not be accepted. No cameras, tape recorders, or other reproduction devices are permitted during Industry Days and the government will not accept any materials that were not part of the contractor's original briefing.</p>
<p>Attendance will be limited solely to pre-registered attendees, and conference attendance will be limited to not more than two attendees per company. A total of 100 seats will be available for industry on a first come, first serve reservation basis for the plenary session each morning.</p>
<p>To reserve a time for a one-on-one session, registration will be made through Defense Information Technology Contracting Office (DITCO) by contacting either Arthur Kruse, at 618-229-9773 or Katie Koerkenmeier at 618-229-9513.
