<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, is seeking a firm to restore the Bois Brule Levee and Drainage District to its authorized level of protection as well as construct a seepage berm for underseepage control. The scope of this project will only address two components of the 2003 Deficiency Correction Report. This work is to design the levee raise and assure it meets all necessary criteria for stability, settlement, seepage and other engineering considerations. The Design Deficiency Correction Report including Environmental Assessment was completed in November of 2003, this document is comprised of multiple components each addressing a different deficiency within the Bois Brule Levee and Drainage District. The Levee Raise and Seepage Berm are two components. The main deficiency in the existing project is caused by problems with the underseepage design. In addition, the levee grade is inadequate in some sections of the back levee where the levee settled below net levee grade (intended design height). The net levee grade for the back levee along Bois Brule and Cinque Hommes Creeks was two feet higher than a profile based of backwater from the 50-year flood on the Mississippi River coincident with a 50-yr headwater flood on Bois Brule and Cinque Hommes Creeks. Underseepage design was completed by a series of spreadsheet analyses, relief well control and/or berm control was chosen for corrections as needed. The overall deficiency correct project includes; seepage relief wells, seepage berms, a clay-filled seepage cutoff trench, pumping stations, restoration of the levee to authorized grade, piezometers, ditching and culverts, and relocation of a public highway. All of the above listed components have been completed or are currently in construction with the exception of the two components described within this scope. USACE will perform the necessary data collection needed to design the restored levee sections. In the2003 geotechnical design the seepage berms met the 1.6 factor of safety for underseepage, however reaches will be looked at more closely to ensure the levee section also meets the factors of safety within EM 1110-2-1913 for stability. Plans and specifications will be completed. The levee sponsor has obtained right of way for the 4.2 miles of back levee needed for the raise. The current plan developed for the deficiency report shows part of the raise as a landside raise and the remaining portion to be a creek-side raise. A hydraulic no rise study will be completed and compared to the hydraulic study in the 2003 report to ensure the creek-side raise will not impact the area negatively by inducing further flooding. Subsurface exploration will take place to acquire the information needed to complete stability analyses and other design requirements, such as settlement to ensure the levee sections will not be above the authorized grade. A factor of safety of 1.4 for stability will be required per EM 1110-2-1913. Plans and specifications will be completed for this effort.
