Qualification Requirements: Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.      Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.  Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.     The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.     When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.     The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.     Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.     DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note(s) 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to provide analytical engineering studies to support the UH-1N/TH-1H for Durability and Damage Tolerance Analysis and Structural Integrity Plan in support of the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) as part of the overall Aging Aircraft Sustainment effort. This effort addresses those concerns through investigation of life predictions and failure analyses that are a direct concern of long-term aircraft use, consideration of corrosion effects that are seen on aircraft after a substantial time in service, consideration of the effects of new structure that has been added to the aircraft due to modifications and upgrades, and investigation of aircraft usage over its service life and the comparison of that usage to original design intent. This program will compliment the existing generic ASIP program of the UH-1N program office, and will focus on identifying and solving UN-1N specific structural integrity issues listed in the Performance Work Specification associated with the 30+ year age of the aircraft.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, (NSWCCD) has been tasked to instrument and test the LCAC model. In order to meet this requirement, NSWCCD needs to expand the capabilities of a currently owned data collection system that will be used to conduct this test.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm fixed price purchase order to HBM, Inc.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 10 May 2007, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government n!  ot to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Alicia Weber by e-mail at Alicia.weber@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-1847 on or before 05/10/2007.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to procure from Cellectricon Incorporated, 15875 Gaither Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20877 the following piece (quantity of one each) of equipment and accessories:  (1) Dynaflow TM Proficient Platform, with the following contents: (a) Advanced controller; (b) Ethernet interface, (c) BNC adapter cable, (d) Ethernet cross over cable 2m; (e) Joystick X/Y; (f) Motorized scanning stage; (g) Insert frame 96 format; (h) Dynaflow chip tm chip socket for 45 x 75mm DF-16 chip; (i) Syringe pump; (j) Pump tube 1 meter including attachment head and syringe; (k) Cross hair graticule ? 27mm; Quantity of three (l)  Dynaflow tm Commander Proficient software on CD-ROM Software License; (m) Dongle and (n) Documentation set for Dynaflow tm Proficient; (2) Dynaflow tm Pro II DF-8 Chips; (3) DF8 Chip Holderand (4) Universal Stage Holder.  A solution delivery system is necessary to analyze kinetic parameters of acetylcholine receptors from transgenic zebrafish in the lab.  A solution delivery system is used in conjunction with a patch clamp amplifier.  A cell expressing acetylcholine receptors is exposed to different solutions containing different chemicals under whole cell patch clamp.  The switching between solutions need to be done on a millisecond scale, because the kinetics of acetylcholine receptors are on orders of milliseconds.  In the Dynaflow system, millisecond switching can be performed between up to 48 different reagents for reading of responses in one single cell.  This allows for collection of high-resolution kinetic data. This type of delivery system is not available with any other system that is commercially available.

<SUBJECT>A -- NINDS ImPACT Program: Fostering Immediate Practice-Altering Clinical Trials
<SOLNBR>NINDS07-S01
<ARCHDATE>05042007
<CONTACT>Kristy Woolbert, KAI Project Manager, Phone 301-770-2753, Fax 301-770-4183, Email KWoolbert@kai-research.com - Rene Kozloff, KAI Co-Principal Inverstigatot, Phone 301-770-2730, Fax 301-7704183, Email RKozloff@kai-research.com
<DESC>KAI Research, Inc. seeks to identify potential subcontract sources to assist in the development of an Immediate Practice-Altering Clinical Trials (ImPACT) program model as part of the work under their NINDS Prime Contract.  The goal of the NINDS ImPACT program is to reduce the burden of neurological disease by identifying high priority questions about best clinical care for patients with neurological conditions, and to facilitate practice-altering research that will answer those questions and improve care. 

A major component and the first step of the ImPACT program will be the development of a mathematical model that will provide an estimate of the potential impact on public health of any given clinical trial in neurology or neurosurgery.  The ImPACT program model will take into consideration the burden of the illness (including incidence, prevalence, financial impact and quality of life considerations) and the variety of possible results of the clinical trial.  A reliable, accurate estimate of public health impact would help to advise the Institute how best to advance its mission to lessen the burden of neurologic disorders and stroke through its clinical trials program.  Once completed, the model will be in the public domain.

The following tasks are considered essential to the development and completion of this model: 1) Identify the discoverable factors that will inform estimates of a clinical trial's potential public health impact, such as disease prevalence/incidence, changes in quality of life measurements, health care costs, and utilization rates, etc.; 2) Develop a model that will estimate the public health impact of any given potential clinical trial as a function of the trial outcome (development of such a model will require access to and must be based on data that are available and in the public domain); 3) Validate the model and establish its accuracy based upon analysis of previous clinical trials ; 4) Evaluate the relevance of the model in estimating the public health impact of clinical trials throughout the range of neurologic disorders. 

KAI Research, Inc. is hereby notifying potential sources of the request for proposals for assisting in the development and implementation of the above described model.  Proposals will be sought from interested and sources believing they are qualified to assist, by virtue of their experience and expertise in health services research, health economics, quality of life, neurological conditions and interventions, and research evaluation, in the development of such a model.  The RFQ will be posted on May 4, 2007 and proposals will be received at KAI by June 18, 2007.  They will be reviewed for technical merit and reasonableness of cost and other factors considered, and a subcontract award selection made pursuant to FAR Parts 15 and 44.  

The estimated period of performance is 9-12 months from date of subcontract award.

<DESC>Description

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is interested in forming partnerships with commercial utility-scale wind turbine industry developers, owners, operators, and manufacturers.  The purpose would be to install and test commercial utility-scale wind turbines at the DOE National Wind Technology Center.  The NWTC is an extreme-event test site, where turbines would be exposed to a wide spectrum of diverse and extreme conditions within a single wind season.  NWTC wind resource data can be found at http://www.nrel.gov/midc/nwtc_m2/.

Objective

The DOE objective is to support industry?s efforts to improve reliability and performance of the utility-scale commercial wind turbine fleet intended for deployment in the United States.  Industry turbines could be tested to characterize power performance, acoustic noise, structural loads, and power quality to better understand and mitigate loads, optimize turbine structures, and increase power production.  Turbines could be used to support training of industry-partner staff and the next generation of wind technology engineers and technicians, and also serve as a showcase to educate the U.S. public on current commercial wind technology.


Scope

?	Testing would be conducted in collaboration with a highly-skilled NWTC laboratory staff capable of devising custom testing strategies, using state-of-the-art instrumentation and equipment, performing comprehensive supporting engineering analyses, and using advanced computer simulation tools.  
?	Power performance, acoustic noise, power quality, and structural loads testing could be conducted in accordance with IEC protocol and accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation.  Specialized testing could also be devised, such as electrical fault ride-through characterization or control system optimization.
?	NWTC extreme-event site conditions are ideal for checking design margins, tuning simulation models, and revealing potential problems.  The NWTC has a mean wind speed of approximately 5 m/s with a very low Weibull K value of approximately 1.2, indicating that high winds are much more common at the NWTC than most sites.  The wind is over 40 m/s for about 70 hours per year and over 50 m/s for about 12 hours per year (10-min averages at 80m).   
?	The NWTC is an established wind test site that enables the turbine installation process to be streamlined.  Most typical project development issues have already been addressed, e.g. siting, grid connection, environmental studies, safety requirements, and inflow characterization. 
?	Industry partners may leverage NWTC staff support to compare NWTC site testing results to other similar machines located in an existing commercial wind farm. 

Partnership Mechanism 
 
The anticipated partnership mechanism would be a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between NREL and the industry partner, providing protection of intellectual property with a clear understanding of partner responsibilities and cost sharing.  Other solicitation mechanisms, such as a Request for Proposal (RFP) process may also be considered based on industry comments and recommendations from this notice.

Schedule

It is anticipated that projects would be conducted over a 1-3 year period.  It is not currently planned that the wind turbines would remain at the wind site after testing is completed.  Anticipated schedule:
May 1, 2007: This pre-solicitation notice posted
June 1, 2007: Industry recommendations received
July 1, 2007: Solicitation request posted
Aug 1, 2007: Industry responses received
Turbine installation duration would depend heavily on schedule of turbine delivery, receipt of foundation and interconnection specifications, erection and commissioning requirements.

Expressions of Interest

The purpose of this notice is to obtain from potential industry participants:

1.	An indication of the level of interest  
2.	The model and size of turbines to be tested at the NWTC, and expected availability date 
3.	Types of tests and support that would be most useful.
4.	Comments on how best to solicit and form partnerships, and how project costs, roles and responsibilities should be shared to best achieve success (e.g., for foundation, site development, infrastructure construction, test planning, shipping, installation, commissioning, power sales revenue, instrumentation, operation, data acquisition, analysis)  

All responses will be held in confidence within the DOE and NREL team.  Industry recommendations on viable partnership options and cost-share will be used to formulate a subsequent solicitation plan, such as a CRADA partnership opportunity announcement or a request for proposal (RFP).  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in any future solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving future notification of related activities, if desired.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and email addresses of the primary contact person; comments on the proposed project; indication of level of interest; and recommendations on partnership options as described above.  Responses are requested to be received at NREL by June 1, 2007.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses (by mail, facsimile or email) to:

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award, under Simplified Acquisitions Procedures (threshold of $100,000) a sole source a time and materials government purchase order to Comanche Nation College (CNC) for development of a program to train and certify billing coders to process Medicare & Medicaid claims.  CMS partners with Tribal College/University (TCUs) to accomplish its mission to assure the health care security of its programs beneficiaries.  This partnership with the TCUs complies with President Bush?s Executive Order 13270 of July 2002, which directs all Federal Agencies to integrate TCUs in their work.

As part of the effort to involve tribal educational institutions in CMS work, the purchase order with the CNC will help address both the CMS strategic plan goal to improve program beneficiaries? access to quality care and the Department?s initiative to reduce health disparities.  This will be accomplished through the development and expansion by the TCU of a program to train students on how to code and bill Medicare, Medicaid and other third party insurance companies for medical services provided in tribal and Indian Health Services (IHS) facilities which are typically located in tribal communities.  Because tribal colleges are situated in tribal communities they are ideally situated to provide training to develop billing coders for these facilities and systems.  This effort began four years ago.  

We are now seeking to continue this training in tribal communities because there remains a shortage of trained billing staff in these locations and few incentives to attract already trained individuals to the rural, frontier or the remote areas where tribal communities are often located.  CMS has received confirmation of the need for trained billers from the tribal community and from its Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG).  The TTAG, which is comprised of elected tribal leaders from across the country, fully supports the CMS efforts to provide training for medical billing coders.  The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), which represents all TCUs, has also verified the need for additional trained billers based on their contacts, and experience with providers in the tribal community and recommended that CMS address this need.  

CNC is located in Oklahoma, where the largest number of tribes in the continental United States is located, it has access to a large potential student pool necessary for this effort.  CNC also has strong ties and relations with other tribal colleges located in the area and can make arrangements to train students at other locations other than on the main campus of the college while at the same time remaining firmly within the tribal community.  CNC has proven access to staff that is trained in the provision of billing coding with an emphasis on CMS issues.  All interested parties must demonstrate a present existing relationship with the TCUs and exhibit the critical quality of the ability to marshal a 
sufficient student population to establish a meaningful billing coding training program.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to extend the term of the BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. SmartRing contract (TIRNO-02-C-00001) for 6 months in order not to disrupt the IRS tax season and pending the transition to the follow-on contract.  Transition to the new contract will begin after the IRS tax season is concluded.  The SmartRing contract, after exercising FAR 52.217-8, expired on March 31, 2007 and has been operating on a month-to-month basis.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The IRS has a continuing need for SmartRing telecommunication services.  The extension of this contract allows for uninterrupted service during tax season and successful transition to the follow-on contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

New SFOs were posted for all AAAP solicitations in April 2007.  The 06 Series SFOs (06-015 (DC), 06-018 (MD) and 06-019(VA)) are no longer active and were replaced in April by the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD) and 07-016 (VA)).  You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs in order to be considered for lease award, effective May 1, 2007 (no awards were made in April 2007 due to technical issues).  A digest of the changes between the 06 and 07 Series SFOs has been posted to the AAAP website.  Existing 06 Series offers can be copied in the AAAP Application and submitted under the 07 Series SFOs using the copy feature provided in the AAAP Application.  In addition, the 07 Series SFOs (07-014, 07-015 and 07-016) were amended on May 1, 2007.  A digest of those amendments is available on the AAAP website.  Offerors who entered an offer under the 07 series SFOs in April do NOT need to re-enter their offer(s) in order to be considered for future awards.  Offerors who did NOT enter an offer under the 07 series SFOs in April MUST submit an offer under the 07 series SFOs in May (see above).  In other words, the replacement of the 06 Series SFOs with the 07 Series SFOs required all 06 Series offers to be resubmitted under the 07 Series SFOs, but the amendment of the 07 Series SFOs does NOT require that existing 07 Series offers be resubmitted.  REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the ?Register to offer space? link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 15th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY: Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the spring of 2007.  DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-014 must be located in Washington, DC.  Delineated areas are clarified further in each of the respective Solicitations for Offers posted on the AAAP website.  LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.

SFO 07-016 - OFFICE SPACE NEEDED - U.S. GOVERNMENT seeks sources for leased space through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) - OFFER SUBMISSION PERIOD OPEN MAY 1, 2007 THROUGH MAY 7, 2007.  New SFOs were posted for all AAAP solicitations in April 2007.  The 06 Series SFOs (06-015 (DC), 06-018 (MD) and 06-019(VA)) are no longer active and were replaced in April by the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD) and 07-016 (VA)).  You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs in order to be considered for lease award, effective May 1, 2007 (no awards were made in April 2007 due to technical issues).  A digest of the changes between the 06 and 07 Series SFOs has been posted to the AAAP website.  Existing 06 Series offers can be copied in the AAAP Application and submitted under the 07 Series SFOs using the copy feature provided in the AAAP Application.  In addition, the 07 Series SFOs (07-014, 07-015 and 07-016) were amended on May 1, 2007.  A digest of those amendments is available on the AAAP website.  Offerors who entered an offer under the 07 series SFOs in April do NOT need to re-enter their offer(s) in order to be considered for future awards.  Offerors who did NOT enter an offer under the 07 series SFOs in April MUST submit an offer under the 07 series SFOs in May (see above).  In other words, the replacement of the 06 Series SFOs with the 07 Series SFOs required all 06 Series offers to be resubmitted under the 07 Series SFOs, but the amendment of the 07 Series SFOs does NOT require that existing 07 Series offers be resubmitted.  REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the ?Register to offer space? link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 15th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY: Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the spring of 2007.  DELINEATED AREA:   All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-016 must be located in Northern Virginia.  Delineated areas are clarified further in each of the respective Solicitations for Offers posted on the AAAP website.  LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

These assemblies must be built from an existing and proven drawing package.  QinetiQ is the only approved vendor for the required GPS modules for the Hellfire program.  No other manufacturers other than QinetiQ can provide thes e modules without being qualified, which represents a substantial duplication of costs that would not likely be recovered through open competition.  Additional installation expenses and man-hour costs would result from purchasing equipment that does not in terface with the existing equipment.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be fully considered by the agency.  Point of contact is Chad E. Kuipers, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-876-3139, e-mail chad.kuipers@us.army.mil.

<DESC>As of 1 May 2007, the status of the CFT request for proposal is as follows:  The source selection team is in the process of finalizing all required documents necessary to obtain official approval to release the draft RFP.  448 CSW/PKM still has not been informed of a confirmed meeting date for OUSD/AT&L to be briefed on the status of the program.  This meeting must occur before the formal approval process can occur, eventually leading to RFP release.

As of this date, our best guess for an RFP release date is 4 Jun 2007 and will continue to be subject to change as events unfold.  However, once the RFP is released, it is still anticipated that offer's will have 45 days to respond with proposals.

Thank you for your continued interest.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to address the following questions that were raised concerning this project. The current response date has been extended until Tuesday, May 8, 2007. 

//Question: How is the terrain of the ground? Flat? Sloped? Answer: There exist sloped and flat areas. The east side of the lot is sloped and the north and south sides of the lot are flat. 
//Question: Is it possible for machinery and vehicles to maneuver around both the outside and the inside perimeter of the fence? Answer: Some vehicles may be driven and machinery used around the inside perimeter of the fence; however, the use of vehicles and machinery will not be possible around the outside perimeter of the fence, especially on the east side. 
//Question: Do any of the posts go through concrete or asphalt? Answer: No. 
//Question: Are there rocks on the surface of the ground? Answer No. 
//Question: Is there existing Chain Link on the Posts? Answer: Yes. There is existing chain link fence. 
//Question: If there is Chain Link, will it need to come down and then be reattached on the new posts? Answer: Yes. 
//Question: Is this fence around a paved lot or straight run? Answer: The fence is around a straight run. 
//Question: Can the posts all be removed at the same time, or is the removal and replacement required to be done in stages? Answer: This project is required to be done in stages, since the fence must remain standing at all times. This is a secure area. 
//Question: Does a temporary fence need to be provided? Answer: No temporary fence is needed, since the fence must remain standing at all times. Solutions may involve replacing the poles in stages or replacing every other pole and then returning to replace the remaining poles.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) optics consisting of 2 aspheric mirrors, mounted on a single optical bench which was posted on April 24, 2007. You are notified that the following changes are made:  The overall specifications required for this acquisition are modified as follows: The PIAA system ¡§base configuration¡¨ (without the aspheric components) is as follows: PIAA M1: ~ 90 mm diameter (Clear aperture), f=900 mm 	PIAA M2: ~ 90 mm diameter (Clear aperture), f=900 mm 	DM: ~ 9 mm diameter beam F numbers through system: 	F/10 to PIAA M1 	Collimated to PIAA M2 from PIAA M1 	F/10 from PIAA M2 The overall specifications are summarized as follows: The PIAA system consists of two aspheric mirrors. Their shape is best described as the sum of three terms: an off-axis parabola (OAP), a radial sag and small corrective terms introduced by the off-axis configuration. The radial sag is 200 micron peak-to-valley. Both mirrors will have an effective beam size of approximately 90mm and will be made from a low-expansion material such as Zerodur. The mirrors will be oversized to avoid edge effects within the beam size. The radial sag shape is different for each of the two mirrors: ƒ{	PIAA M1 radial sag is concave on most of the mirror but convex near the edge of the beam. The convex part is narrow (approximately 5 mm wide) and may be the most challenging feature of the PIAA system ƒ{	PIAA M2 radial sag is convex in the center and concave in the edge. The transition between the convex center and concave edge is very gradual, and this mirror is therefore not as challenging to manufacture/test Both mirrors shall be mounted on a single bench, with possibility to align them. The exact shape of the mirrors, especially the radial sag, will be confirmed after a preliminary study is completed by the vendor. Our radial sag specification may be tuned to minimize manufacturing risk. The optics should have a surface accuracy of no more than 5nm RMS up to 20 cycles per aperture. The PIAA mirrors need to be permanently aligned to meet this requirement, or need to be on motorized mounts which can reach and maintain this alignment. The PIAA optics and their mounting need to be vacuum compatible. The optical configuration of the PIAA optics is an off-axis focus-to-focus system, where the input and output are approximately F/10, and the beam size is approximately 90mm. The exact geometry of the PIAA system may be modified slightly to facilitate manufacturing & testing.  The mounting system also needs to be built to allow for exchanging of mirrors as well as including modular mounting structures to add electronics or other smaller mirror systems. This system uses front surface mirrors.  All surfaces except for the front mirror surface, shall be ¡§fine grind¡¨ or commercial polished.  Each mirror should have a surface accuracy  of 5nm RMS or better up to 20 cycles per aperture. The mirror coatings should be uniform to better than 0.5% reflectivity across the effective aperture. The due date for responses is extended to May 11, 2007.  Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/ARC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The only known source is the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC). CRITFC has conducted age and length-at-age analysis of Chinook passing through Bonneville for the past 20 years and has provided similar analyses for steelhead since 2004.  CRITFC already has all the sampling permits, the infrastructure, personnel, and expertise for safely handling multiple listed fish species.  They are already conducting partial tissue sampling for Chinook, and they are the only group that could also conduct the genotyping (in addition to providing the best quality genetic data in the basin).  Additionally, CRITFC currently has an established sampling program for adult salmonids in place at the Bonneville Dam fish ladders and has thousands of tissue samples from previous years that will be essential to this project.

<DESC>Description:  The U.S. General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service, on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), an operating division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to award a task for the following described effort.  The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) is seeking a task for development, support, and training on a number of highly specialized components of the IHS health information system, known as the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).

Background:  The RPMS has been the health information solution for IHS since the early 1980's and is comprised of an integrated suite of over sixty clinical, administrative, financial and infrastructure applications.  RPMS provides the data that informs individual patient care, assesses quality of care and the health status of communities, and enables reporting on the performance of the Indian Health Service mission.  RPMS evolved from the VistA system in use at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), but has diverged significantly from VistA because of differences in the two agencies' clinical and business needs.  In particular, for example, the heart of the RPMS clinical application suite is the Patient Care Component, a repository of encounter-based data that has no analog within VistA.

RPMS programming is done in M (formerly MUMPS), and the database infrastructure is VA Fileman.  A few applications have graphical user interfaces (GUI) over the server-side M applications.  The RPMS is essentially unique to Indian Health Service, and the IHS uses a small group of federal (in-house) and contracted developers to maintain, support, and enhance the various components.  The work sought is specific to a number of core RPMS applications and requires detailed and specialized knowledge of M programming, the RPMS health information system, and the practice environment in which the system is used.

Objectives:  The objective of this effort is to continuously maintain and enhance the core patient encounter and performance reporting applications and closely related RPMS systems so that they remain current with evolving Agency directives and user requirements.  Additional objectives include the acquisition of high-quality training and application support for the specified applications. 

The essential requirements of this task are as follows:  

Regular and timely enhancements to the RPMS Patient Care Component (PCC) as identified by end users, through the change management processes of the RPMS Program Management Office.  These include enhancements to the Patient Education documentation system of RPMS.

Ongoing development of the RPMS Clinical Reporting System (CRS) application.  CRS is the clinical performance measurement application of IHS.  The application uses highly specialized and complex logic to query thousands of RPMS data fields to evaluate compliance with hundreds of performance indicators.  The application is on an aggressive development schedule, with two version releases annually. 
 
Ongoing development of the RPMS Immunization application, which provides registry functions, reminders, and point of care documentation of immunization services.  The Immunization package is regularly updated to remain current with rapidly changing vaccine products and recommendations.

Maintenance and support of the RPMS Immunization Data Exchange, which exchanges information between IHS/Tribal facilities and State immunization registries in order ensure safe and comprehensive immunization of children.

Maintenance, support, and ongoing development of the RPMS Behavioral Health System, an application that supports individual and group documentation, treatment planning, and administrative activity reporting for mental health, social service, and chemical dependency providers in a variety of settings.

Maintenance and development in the RPMS Diabetes Management System, a registry, reminder, and reporting system used by IHS and Tribal sites for specialized case management of diabetic patients.

Maintenance of various data interface systems utilized by RPMS applications, including the RPMS Generic Interface System (GIS), the VA HL7 application, X.12 interface, and others.

Maintenance and support for the various exports from RPMS applications to the IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW).

Maintenance, support, and enhancements for the IHS version of the VA Patient Information Management System (PIMS).

Maintenance and support for the RPMS Community Health representative application.

Technical/programming support for released versions of all of the above RPMS applications, as well as user support for many of the applications.

Training of end-users on multiple RPMS applications including PCC Data Entry, PCC Management Reports, Patient Registration, PIMS, Behavioral Health applications, and others.

Respondents are requested to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the essential requirements outlined above.  SOCs are limited to a total of five (5) pages single spaced.  Submit responses electronically to rudy.chavez@GSA.gov and howard.hays@ihs.gov no later than 4:00 pm Mountain Daylight Saving Time on May 23, 2007.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
Office of Personnel Management
Entrance on Duty Solution
1.  Background:
The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) requires Federal agencies to expand the use of electronic government (e-Gov) to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of services provided to citizens.  Under the PMA, several lines of business have been established to consolidate, improve and streamline business processes across the Executive Branch.

The Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) initiative was launched in 2004 to support the vision articulated in the President’s Management Agenda.  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the managing partner for the HR LOB.  

The HR LOB is expected to help the Federal government realize the potential of electronic government by significantly enhancing human resources service delivery within the Executive Branch.  The HR LOB Concept of Operations (CONOPS) proposes a near-term service delivery model where some highly transactional and administratively intense HR services move from the agencies to HR shared service centers.  This approach will allow agencies to increase their focus on core mission activities and the strategic management of human capital, with HR shared service centers delivering the HR transactional services in an efficient and cost-effective manner focused on customer service quality.

The HR LOB Program is developing Enterprise Architecture, in compliance with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) guidelines as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  To date the HR LOB and its member agencies have developed three of the five reference models that make up the FEA.  

One of those models, the Business Reference Model (BRM), describes a government-wide view of the sub-functions, processes and activities that agencies perform to deliver HR services to employees of the Federal government.  “Entrance on Duty” (EOD) falls within the BRM sub-function “Staff Acquisition” and includes bringing on new hires and transferring Federal employees.  HR LOB Business Reference Model and Core Requirements are available at http://www.opm.gov/egov/.

The HR LOB, in concert with Federal agencies, is developing detailed requirements for a standard government-wide approach to EOD that will be incorporated into an EOD Concept of Operations.  The CONOPS will also provide results of an EOD market analysis, propose a process and technology concept model for delivering EOD services, and recommend an overall acquisition strategy for Entrance on Duty.  

In addition to the EOD initiative, OPM, through the Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) project, is also moving forward to replace hard copy employee Official Personnel Files (OPFs) with electronic versions.  Documents currently contained in OPFs will be digitally imaged, and new transactions stored in an electronic format.  When completed, employees, HR professionals, and managers will be able to view the OPF electronically.    
2.  Description of Information Requested:
Note:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No solicitation will be issued at this time.  

Federal agencies have a potential requirement for an Entrance on Duty (EOD) solution that can automate labor-intensive, manual processes, seamlessly integrate with other government-wide services, and provide sufficient functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of all government agencies.  Systems based on commercial or government off-the-shelf software will be considered.     

Vendors responding to this RFI must provide:

1. Name and address of the firm
2. Size of the business with type of ownership (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, hub-zone, and/or disabled veteran)
3. Years in business
4. Description of the client base
5. Capability Statement containing documentation showing the successful completion of IT projects of similar complexity within the past three years.

OPM is engaged in preliminary market research and is currently consolidating and/or refining requirements from several federal agencies for an EOD solution.  Accordingly, the purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from vendors regarding commercially available products and services which are capable of meeting Federal EOD needs.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice and not a request for quotations.  The purpose of this announcement is to determine the number of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HubZone Businesses, or other Small Businesses who can furnish the service listed below.  
 
The Bureau of Public Debt on behalf of  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor for synthesis and recommendations on the design and specification of interior and exterior lighting for people who have low vision.

BACKGROUND
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is an independent federal agency concerned with accessibility for people with disabilities.  The Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility guidelines to ensure that newly constructed and altered buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.  In November 1999, the Access Board issued a proposed rule to revise and update its accessibility guidelines.  During the public comment period on the proposed rule, the Access Board received comments from individuals with vision impairments about the need for standards for interior and exterior lighting.  Commenters from deafness organizations also noted the need for adequate lighting for sign language communication.  Similar comments were made at the Board?s public information meeting on July 25, 2006.  In addition, the January 2001 report of the Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee (PROWAAC) recommends research to define specifications for exterior lighting levels in the pedestrian environment.  No current US lighting industry standards include provisions or recommendations for lighting levels that serve the needs of people who have vision impairments, including the large and growing population of individuals with age-related vision loss.  While the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (1991) sets minimum lighting levels for elevator car controls, platform, and car threshold and landing sills (ADAAG 4.10.11), no other lighting minima or characteristics are specified.  These provisions were retained in the 2004 ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines.  

Much is known about illumination levels, types, and criteria that will support low-vision users;  recommendations are available from a variety of resources in the US and abroad, including The Lighthouse, Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, Johns Hopkins Eye Research Institute, the Council of Citizens with Low Vision International, the American Foundation for the Blind, The Society of Light and Lighting in the UK, and Queen?s University in Canada.  Key issues include:

	--color rendering;
 	--color and luminance contrast;
	--glare;
	--emergency and egress route illumination levels;
	--exterior route illumination levels; and
	--lamp types, fixtures, and mountings.

OBJECTIVE
The Board seeks a consultant knowledgeable in low-vision lighting issues to produce a synthesis of current U.S. and international knowledge, research, standards, and recommendations on interior and exterior lighting for low-vision users.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Working with the Board and other experts, including lighting standards developers, the consultant shall identify and review completed and current research and standards, both US and international, that are relevant to interior and exterior illumination for people who have low vision.  From this information and input, the consultant shall research and develop a synthesis that describes the current state of science in this subject area and formulate recommendations for comprehensive new guidelines for interior and exterior illumination that can be further developed by the Board for incorporation into the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines.  The synthesis shall identify locations where accessible lighting levels are critical for usability. In addition, locations where lighting may be needed for sign language communication must be identified.

The synthesis shall include a consensus of expert recommendations on interior and exterior lighting characteristics for low-vision users, identification and discussion of key issues requiring resolution, and recommendations for future research.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The Contractor shall meet with the CO within 30 days of project award.  The final report shall be submitted for review and approval within 120 days of project award.  Alternate formats shall be submitted within 15 days of approval of the final draft.   A presentation to the Board will be scheduled at a time of mutual convenience.

Responses to this announcement shall be sent to:  Gina Hanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 304-480-7181, Fax (304) 480-7204, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov by 2:00 p.m., Eastern time April 23, 2007.

 The Bureau of Public Debt on behalf of  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor for synthesis and recommendations on measures of work efficiency and related issues in manual wheel chair use on cross slopes on outdoor pedestrian surfaces.

BACKGROUND
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is an independent federal agency concerned with accessibility for people with disabilities.  The Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility guidelines to ensure that newly constructed and altered buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.  In June 2002, the Board published draft guidelines  for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way that included provisions that set maximum cross slope of an accessible outdoor pedestrian route at 2%, consistent with standards first developed in 1980 for routes in buildings and on sites.  

Several research projects on human factors in manual wheelchair use have identified cross slope as a key factor in usability.  However, there is no consensus on method or measurement protocols for assessing the effects of cross slope on the mobility and safety of people who use manual wheelchairs outdoors. Some highway industry research has employed methods that purport to show that cross slopes that exceed 2% do not exacerbate the difficulty of manual wheelchair travel, perhaps because only one arm is used in forward motion, the other being used for braking.  The physics of cross slope, on the other hand, show that a 5% cross slope requires resistance to a downturning force more than double that at 2%.  The US Access Board believes that standard human factors measures developed for ambulatory persons may not reflect considerations significant to manual wheelchair users.

OBJECTIVE
The Board seeks a consultant to look at the research record on manual wheelchair users and nondisabled subjects, including athletes in both categories, and extract information needed to produce a compare-and-contrast analysis (method-to-method and between populations) of :

--the various measures of energy use, effort, efficiency, and work utilized in 
  human factors research today (SmartWheel, oxygen uptake; carbon dioxide 
  expulsion; heart rate, user perceptions, etc.); and

--the physiological parameters of human performance (lactic acid threshold, 
  resting/maximum heart rate, MET values, maximum power produced, etc).

In addition to these comparisons/analyses, develop factors that address the related effects of cross slope on manual wheelchair users, including:

--surface moisture that may lead to slipping; 
--the stability and tipping points of wheelchairs; 
--caster flutter effects; 
--one-armed propulsion effects (e.g., loss of momentum); 
--arm and shoulder fatigue;  and

Brand Name Justification:  This requirement to Washington Group Sales for the purchase of 3-form product material and directly associated services appears to meet the criteria for a Brand Name (other than full and open competition) acquisition for the following reasons.  

As a cost-saving measure, the architect factored this project into the design of the space.  This project has been essentially completed in the design phase.  This specific product was designed in by the architect, a potential change to another product may not allow for the successful completion.  We expect that once the building permit issue is resolved, it will take approximately three (3) weeks to complete the construction.  The building permit issue should be resolved in approximately 1-2 weeks.  The area specified for the 3-form design need to be completed in order to pass final inspection and be ready for staff move-in within two weeks after completion.  Delay in moving into the space as scheduled will have a major impact on other NIH components scheduled to backfill the space we vacate.

The contractor shall deliver the products and services after receipt of award, the Government will evaluate based on F.O.B. destination, and acceptance at Bethesda, Maryland.     Information provided must demonstrate the ability to meet the specifications described herein.  Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall provide pertinent information that is in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform within 5 days of this notice.   Award will be made to the technically acceptable low offer.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
One (1)  Dual Downhole Fuel Fluorescence Detector (FFD) will be acquired and applied to core samples gathered in Blind Pass, Tampa Bay, FL.  A series of sediment cores will be collected 1) in areas though to be free of hydrocarbons; 2) thought to be likely to contain hydrocarbons; 3) from areas which may or may not have hydrocarbons; Sediment cores will be split open and analyzed for hydrocarbons by pushing the FFD probe down the length of the core.  The feasibility of making FFD measurements in the field will also be evaluated. If FFD field measurements are determined to be viable, then field measurements will be gathered to complement the core samples being gathered.  These measurements will enable AOML to identify and study the distribution of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in Blind Pass.

MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS:
Fuel Fluorescence detector must have the following:

1.	Ultraviolet light source (UV) that activates aromatic hydrocarbons to fluorescence.  Fluorescence is detected at two different wavelengths by two photomultiplier tubes (PMT).

2.	Cone Penetrometer Technology (CPT) capability to push the FFD probe up to 25 feet into coastal marine environments (muddy/sandy substrates), which will significantly reduce the time needed to detect and delineate hydrocarbons.

3.	Streamlined cables ? the use of a 10-conductor cable capable for CPT data and high voltage lamp supply, along with locating the optical detectors downhole.  The cable diameter must be 0.35 inches and be used with 1.75 OD CPT push rods.

4.	Dual photomultiplier tubes must be able to be pushed downhole to eliminate signal attenuation in the optical fiber, allowing weakly fluorescent compounds to be detected at any depth below ground surface.

5.	The use of dual optical filters must allow differentiation between lighter fuels, which fluoresce more intensely at low wavelengths, and heavier fuels, which fluoresce more intensely at longer wavelengths.

6.	The dual FFD must provide continuous real-time output of fluorescence during the entire time the probe is being pushed into the sediments.  This information must be able to be viewed graphically in real-time with the CPT Data acquisition system (DAS) as the probe is advanced through the substrate.

7.	CPT delivery system must generate minimal investigation derived waste, which will reduce the cost of containerization and disposal.

8.	Ultraviolet light source must be a mercury discharge lamp.

9.	Excitation wavelength of 254nm.

10.	Housing must be hardened steel with durable coating.

11.	Optical window must be replaceable Sapphire.

12.	Detection limit of <100ppm (TPH).

13.	Power = 12VDC, 5 Amp, 60W.

14.	Output = 0-12VDC digital.

15.	The field portable digital CPT DAS must be housed in a water-resistant instrument case.

16.	The sensor specific data (calibration factors, serial numbers, and sensor type) must be stored in each sensor module in the cone, and automatically transmit to the instrument control unit with each penetration of the FFD probe, allowing a technician with minimal training to operate the system.

17.	The system must provide easy to follow pull down menus which allows the operator to quickly input all pertinent test information and the digitized voltage signal from any sensor can be viewed on screen for simple field diagnostics.

18.	Instrument control unit must come with a complete software package for acquisition, processing, and plotting data.

19.	Instrument control unit must be able to generate software-quality plots in the field even while the probe is being pushed.

20.	Instrument control unit must have an auxiliary channel which provides a 4.00VDC excitation and a 200 gain bi-polar input, which will allow the user to input optional devices.

21.	The computer which runs the system must be: laptop suitable for work in the field and include the following: 1) Pentium III or above processor; 2) Windows XP; 3) 1 GB system memory; 4) CD/RW/DVD internal drive; 5) USB and serial ports; 6) touch screen capability.

22.	The Contractor must provide the Government staff with training in use of the FFD system.

NIAID supports its intramural and extramural research programs by facilitating collaborations between NIAID researchers and external research and development organizations. NIAID utilizes scientific, legal and business expertise to negotiate agreements with academic and nonprofit institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and other government agencies.  NIAID is the Institute’s official repository for these agreements and is responsible for the management of NIAID's patent portfolio and expenses and serves as the resource for all issues concerning intellectual property. In addition, NIAID also manages receipt of CRADA funds, supports NIH's licensing program, and tracks license royalty receipts and provides investigators with training on NIH technology transfer policies and regulations and with other Institutes of the NIH on technology transfer matters. In order to better manage these activities and comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, NIAID is seeking a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NIAID’s combined requirements for managing its technology transfer data and documents.  This Technology Transfer Database TTD will also access information at other databases such as those managed by OTT (NIH’s central technology transfer office), the USPTO, EPO, and others to input data and cross check the accuracy of its information.  NIAID will provide a managed hosting environment for the database system as well as software integration services with other relevant NIAID and NIH systems to the extent required by this project. The purpose of this project is to procure and implement a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NIAID’s combined requirements for managing its technology transfer data and documents.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: 

Questions and Answers

1.  What type and quantities of dispensing units are required?

1 remote dispensing unit powered by a 3/4 hp submersible pump with pump controller.

2.  Are the dispensers to be mounted on the tank or on an island at grade?

The dispenser will be located next to the tank. The pump goes in the tank and the fuel is piped over to the dispenser that will sit at grade.

3.  How will the tank be filled? Will it require a ladder and platform or a remote fill port?  

The tank will be filled at a remote fill port. This was not included in the initial specification and the costs associated with the addition of a fill port will have to be determined.

The remote fill port will allow the driver of the fuel truck to unload the fuel at approximately waist level. He/she will not have to ascend ladder/stairs to reach an elevated platform to pump the fuel into the tank from the top.

4.  Will the electrical conduit and wire will be provided at the tank pad?  Will additional conduit and wire need to be provided by the contractor to connect the fuel management system to the dispensers?

The government will provide electrical conduit at the tank pad.  However, the contractor will need to provide additional conduit to connect the fuel management system to the dispensers.

NIAID supports its intramural and extramural research programs by facilitating collaborations between NIAID researchers and external research and development organizations. NIAID utilizes scientific, legal and business expertise to negotiate agreements with academic and nonprofit institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and other government agencies.  NIAID is the Institute’s official repository for these agreements and is responsible for the management of NIAID's patent portfolio and expenses and serves as the resource for all issues concerning intellectual property. In addition, NIAID also manages receipt of CRADA funds, supports NIH's licensing program, and tracks license royalty receipts and provides investigators with training on NIH technology transfer policies and regulations and with other Institutes of the NIH on technology transfer matters. In order to better manage these activities and comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, NIAID is seeking a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NIAID’s combined requirements for managing its technology transfer data and documents.  This Technology Transfer Database TTD will also access information at other databases such as those managed by OTT (NIH’s central technology transfer office), the USPTO, EPO, and others to input data and cross check the accuracy of its information.  NIAID will provide a managed hosting environment for the database system as well as software integration services with other relevant NIAID and NIH systems to the extent required by this project. The purpose of this project is to procure and implement a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NIAID’s combined requirements for managing its technology transfer data and documents. The scope of the intended system is to meet the data management for all NIAID technology transfer activities in a single system. The records and documents handled include, transactional agreements, patent correspondence, license and royalty monitoring and special consulting projects.  The TTD system must take in data from NIH’s centralized Office of Technology Transfer on a daily or weekly basis and compare that with the information with that in NIAID’s database. The system must also be able to check with the USPTO and EPO websites to obtain information from those databases on patents maintained for NIAID. The system must allow users across NIAID to use a web based portal for accessing standard forms (e.g. material transfer and invention reporting forms) to track tasks, information and agreements. The TTD system must be able to generate standard correspondence and forms using data from the database. 
The Offeror must have specific successful experience in developing, implementing and supporting technology transfer data management systems for academic or government offices as evidenced by documented instances of prior performance. Specifically, the system shall provide the following requirements: Tracking and organization of invention disclosures, licenses, patents during and after prosecution, funded transactional agreements like CRADAs, MTAs,  CDAs and also non-funded transactional agreements.  The system must also be capable of inventor uploading of invention disclosures, investigator uploading of MTA information, tracking important dates across the database, email reminders and alarms to inform individual NIAID staff of important events. Further the system must be capable of tracking Special Projects Extramural, consulting, and marketing) as well as funding associated with agreements, licenses and patent costs. The system must also be capable of using Adobe PDF forms for inputting data and other NIAID/NIH compatible programs. Further the system must be able to import files (PDF, Word or other formats), link documents to records, document preparation using form letters and database fields, printing of Adobe PDF or MS word forms and document version control management, manage workflow by projects, and individual staff, tracking of daily actions and the ability to send e-mail notifications of critical dates to staff.  The system must be capable of performing retrievals or searches using Fuzzy Logic, Stemming, Wildcards, Boolean Operators, and Proximity Searches.  The TTD should be able to generate a variety of reports based on the following:  Invention – actions and status; Agreement – actions and status; Special Projects – actions and status; Activities over a given time period; with a given company or institution; by a given user; by a group of users; and be able to export the reports to NIAID compatible spreadsheets or applications. In addition, the system must allow customizable permissions such as administrator functions and rights; system management requirements; making global changes; remote access; and customizable levels of security so that different groups can be given access to subsets of data.  The system must be compatible across both the MAC and PC platforms. Additional baselines requirements for the system shall support access to database through a Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X-based operating system and shall support up to 50 concurrent users; a web interface for remote access to data; and appropriate documentation as required by NIAID. The following tasks shall be performed independent of Government supervision, direction, or control: Task 1 – Technology Transfer and Patent Database System – The contractor shall provide an initial configured and operational system within six weeks following award and shall deliver and configure necessary COTS software as well as source code within this period. Task 2 – Legacy Data - The contractor shall be responsible for importing existing OTD technology transfer and patent data into the new TTD system within the six week period specified in Task 1 above.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for Tyndall AFB for the following commercial items:

In reviewing the above specifications, the following questions/comments arose:

1. What length trailer do you need?  18 feet
2. Will you need insulation?  Yes
3. You state you need a front ramp.  Is this trailer to be a V-Nose? Or is the ramp to be on the front side?  In addition, the ramp dimensions state 36? and 91? x 78? please clarify.  Ramp door should be in the rear of the trailer, 91? X 78? with spring assist
4. If possible, I would re-consider a piano hinge on the side door.  The hinge pins are quite small and the hinges are metal to metal.  A larger strap hinge gives excellent support and the hinge pins ride on bushings.  Without bushings, the pins must be lubed with oil which attracts dust.  Strap hinge is acceptable

<DESC>GWOT Data Collection Solicitation Questions                                     W912HQ-07-T-0001 1.  Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services? If yes, who is it?  There in no incumbent contractor.   2.  What is the proposal response due date?  May 11, 2007 3.  Is the May 8 date a hard date?  There is no way we would be able to get our questions answered and get the proposal written in that time frame.  I guess the real question is - will an extension be possible?  Solicitation amended. 4.  How strict are the vendor requirements?  We are strong on IT but not history.  We have a long list of Fed. Govt references but not CoE.  If there are others that are matching these requirements than we probably don't need to start down the path.  If th ese requirements really are necessary, maybe there is some scholarly type that you already know of, we could possibly team up on this one.  The statement of work requires that the successful offeror have considerable data management expertise, but also hav e sufficient academic training and experience to put the current digital information in its proper historic context.       5.  How is the existing data stored currently?  Flat files?  Is there a comprehensive list of file types?  The existing material is stored on a shared drive and a series of external drives.  There is not a comprehensive list of file types. 6.  Is the Electronic Research Collection in Oracle?  Something else?  The Electronic Research Collection is in its formative stages.  The Office of History has not selected a platform yet.  7.  Why the requirement for work being done on site?  If the index was generated on site can the bulk of the work be done at our own offices? The work needs to be done on site because the contractor will have to work closely with the Office of History staf f to identify and sort the documents.        8.  If the data is to large to be on the local network, how will someone run an index across the entire set?  Once duplicate records are removed from the collection, the data can reside on the local network.
