<DESC>This is the first modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 


QUESTION: Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow contractor personnel to become position certified, facility rated and allow enough time in all ATC facilities to become professionally comfortable before OJT is performed?

ANSWER: Yes, The Government expects the contractor’s employees to gain familiarity with facility operations within the first 30-day period.  The operation at the BIAP airport is VFR/Special VFR with operations averaging 175 per 10-hour day (4 operations per 15-minute period). All contractor employees should be well versed in these operations and should have had experience at airports with a far higher operations count.

QUESTION:  Does the reference to NLT 30 Days in SOW Paragraph 4.1 apply to OJT as well?

ANSWER: OJT shall begin NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives for duty at the facility.

QUESTION:  If the 6 month period is to be waived in lieu of an assumed 30 day period above, does the PCO/FAA intend the contractor to operate and manage the BIAP and other ATCT facilities within 30 days after award? 

ANSWER: Management of the various facilities will remain under GECA control. The contractor is expected to primarily provide OJT to student controllers and to secondarily provide effective management techniques to the GECA supervisors and management staff. 

QUESTION:  If the PCO/FAA does not allow the contractor to become position certified and facility rated prior to performance of OJT does the PCO/FAA intend to waive any requirements for OJT certifications or will OJT also be performed by position certified/facility rated individuals outside the contract? (i.e. USAF controllers?)

ANSWER: The Government presumes that the contractor’s employees will be capable of acquiring a level of proficiency suitable to perform OJT NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives on duty at the facility. No other persons outside the contract are expected to provide OJT.

.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA established procedures for ICAO Class 3 medical and psychological evaluations? 

ANSWER: MOT/GECA has an established medical certification program but no MOT/GECA orders exist to verify that ICAO SARPs have been appropriately followed.

QUESTION:  Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA implemented an evaluation screening program and what standards besides ICAO Annex 1 are being used? (Age limits etc.)

ANSWER: MOT/GECA relies on the screening practices of the past thirty years. This is one of the many management controls must be brought into compliance with ICAO SARPS.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA conducted a formal ATC training needs assessment and if so is the needs assessment available for review?

ANSWER: The FAA has been overseeing the BIAP tower operation since July 4, 2004, seven days per week/10 hours per day. No formal assessment has been done but primary training needs have been identified: technical air traffic control English language proficiency, VFR operations, and weather observations (LAWRS).

QUESTION:  If an ATC training needs assessment has not been performed, will the PCO allow the contractor to perform an ATC training needs assessment?

ANSWER: It is imperative that the contractor in concert with MOT/GECA perform an ATC training needs assessment. This assessment should identify the needs within the current control environment, and future needs when hostilities cease and standard international airport operations become possible.

QUESTION:  Will FAAO 3120.4 AT Technical Training be required as the basis for the development of the Iraqi ATC Controller Certification Program?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is committed to adopt and adapt FAA orders to the extent possible to resurrect their management control procedures. Adaptation of FAAO 3120.4 should be accomplished in concert with the MOT/GECA ATS Director and should be an incremental process: minimum immediately required procedures, followed by a mid-term adaptation and assessment, and then leading to a final long-term document.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor have regarding certifications?  

ANSWER: None.  The authority for all certifications rests with MOT/GECA. The contractor is responsible for providing controller assessments and certification recommendations to MOT/GECA. FAA oversight will continue throughout this and other phases of the execution of the contract.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor possess during OJT instruction of Iraqi ATC Supervisors and Managers?

ANSWER: The contractor will provide advice and recommendations to ATC Supervisors throughout the course of each operational day. Management techniques should be discussed with the ATS Director as needed. The authority and responsibility of the tower operation rests with the MOT/GECA ATC Supervisors. 

QUESTION:  Who is presently responsible for daily operations and management oversight of BIAP ATCT?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is responsible for daily operations and management oversight of the tower with assistance of an FAA ATC Advisor.

QUESTION:  What relationship if any will the current BIAP ATCT management have with the contractor?

ANSWER: The MOT/GECA ATS Director will receive direct benefit of the activities of the contractor. The FAA will continue in its ATC Advisory role.

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to transfer all or any responsibility or authority to the contractor for operating and managing BIAP ATCT? 

ANSWER: There is no such intent.

QUESTION:    Does the PCO/FAA intend to provide for a “Phase-In” period of contractor air traffic controllers to take operational control and management of BIAP?

ANSWER: The phase-in period in limited to the contractor’s need to gain familiarity sufficient to provide OJT and management advice and consultation. 

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to contract the operations and management of the BIAP and other ATCTs in Iraq?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION:  If the contractor is to provide ATC services at any time during the contract what are the expected rolls of contractor personnel and who will the contractor’s personnel report to at the ATCT facilities?

ANSWER: The Contractor’s Project Leader.

QUESTION:  If contractor personnel are required to provide ATC duties does the PCO intend to dedicate contractor personnel for ATC services and then dedicate other contractor personnel for training? 

ANSWER: No.


QUESTION:  Can the contractor employ US FAA certified controllers to perform the training or do they need to be ICAO certified?

ANSWER: The contractor may employ any properly certified and experienced personnel (including Us FAA certified controllers) so long as they are able to apply ICAO procedures.

QUESTION:  What is the time requirement, if any, for employing these personnel with regards to currency or past experience? (ATC experience within the last 6 months? etc.)

ANSWER: Currency of experience and past experience are obvious requirements for the successful execution of any ATC contract. Considering the minimal density of air traffic operations at BIAP, Basrah and other facilities, the contractor should employ the best available employees possible without further guidance from GECA/PCO/FAA.


QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow enough time for the contractor to train and certify contractor’s personnel for all ATCTs in order to operate and manage the facilities and then become OJT instructor certified?

ANSWER: The initial 30 days should be enough for this to be accomplished with the proper personnel.


QUESTION:  Will all facility memorandums, operation plans, Letter of Agreements, and other necessary publications be available for review prior to submission of quotes?

ANSWER:  No.


QUESTION: What minimum level of insurance will be required for the performance of this contract?

ANSWER:  Base Defense Act requirements.

QUESTION:  What level of actual ATC services performance by contractors is expected with the SOW as it is written?

ANSWER: OJT is the prime activity of this contract; actual ATC services beyond OJT will be rare.
