The Government intends to make an award by May 2009.

A description of the work to be performed follows:  
Calibration of the integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model of the Sacramento Valley using the in-house HydroGeoSphere (HGS) numerical model is required to enhance the model's utility for analyses of surface and subsurface water interactions and hence impacts of groundwater pumping on surface water.
Task 1: Re-generation of Finite-Element MeshSubtask 1.1. The Government will provide to the Contractor a DEM with the HGS Sacramento Valley model domain.  The Contractor shall import the DEM into a GIS-based tool, such as ArcHydro, to generate a stream network. The Contractor shall evaluate inconsistencies between the DEM generated stream networks and those resulting from the topography driven stream networks resulting from the HGS Sacramento Valley model files. The Contractor shall resolve inconsistencies using areal information from other sources (e.g., Google Earth). The Contractor shall modify the DEM with the GIS-based tool to ensure that well-defined, correctly placed streams result from the model topography.  Subtask 1.2. The Contractor shall import the processed DEM in Grid Builder to generate a 2-D land surface mesh with sufficient refinement along the stream paths defined by the DEM to represent the stream network. The Contractor shall interpolate the elevations from the processed DEM onto the created mesh.
Subtask 1.3. The Contractor shall import the mesh elevations into a GIS-based tool (e.g., ArcHydro) and check for consistency of flow paths. If necessary, the Contractor shall re-process mesh elevations to remove local sinks that may reappear due to interpolation.
Subtask 1.4. The Contractor shall use the new 2-D mesh to create a three dimensional mesh that includes the subsurface grid layering with appropriate layer thicknesses as needed by the model. The Contractor shall populate the new mesh with surface and subsurface properties. The Contractor shall perform initial simulation of overland flow to check for consistency with the actual stream network determined by areal sources.
Task 2: Adjustment of Numerical Parameters to Reduce Run TimeThe Contractor shall adjust numerical parameters to reduce the model run time such that a 15-year simulation and all additional work can be completed within the stated performance period.Task 3: Parameterization and Sensitivity Analysis:In this task, the Contractor shall: (a) determine the appropriate surface/subsurface flow parameters to be considered in the calibration process; (b) perform sensitivity analyses on the appropriate model parameters to determine the parameters most suitable for calibration.  
Task 4: Linkage of PEST and HGS:The Contractor shall prepare all input and output file templates needed for automated calibration of the HGS model using Parameter Estimation (PEST).  
Task 5: Linked PEST-HGS Calibration Runs:Based on the results of Task 1 and using the input and output file templates from Task 2, the Contractor shall perform the calibration runs.  
Task 6: Analysis and Documentation of Results:The Contractor shall write a report documenting and analyzing the results from the calibration runs of Task 3.  This shall include presentation of which parameter values were changed and the associated improvement in agreement with the observed data.

<DESC><p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of cavity-optomechanics.  While mechanical properties of light have long been understood, the idea that light can be used to effectively damp the motion of a macroscopic object is quite new.  The ORCHID program is focused on exploiting optomechanical interactions between high-Q optical cavities coupled with high-Q mechanical resonators to damp or amplify the motion of macroscopic mechanical devices.  In this context, damping does not lower the bulk temperature of a device; instead it affects only a few of the device's vibrational modes. However, it is these same vibrational modes that can perform transduction in mechanical sensors. As a result, this type of damping can be used to control (in situ) the dynamic range and bandwidths of mechanical sensors and to remove constraints imposed by thermal noise.  When optomechanical damping (cooling) is strong enough to remove phonons from the relevant modes, the quantum mechanical properties of the device are expected to become manifest, enabling entirely new sensing and signal processing functionality.  By contrast, when phonon energy is transferred from the optical cavity to the mechanical oscillator, its motion can be amplified. Thus, another aspect of the ORCHID program focuses on the development of high frequency regenerative optomechanical oscillators. These oscillators are expected to exhibit reduced linewidth and phase noise.  They will be unique in the world of oscillators, as they will feature purely optical input and output for both power and signal.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  (electronic mail: DARPA-BAA-09-26@darpa.mil, fax: 703-496-2069, DARPA/MTO.)   See the full BAA document attached.</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought 

Requirement: 

The United States Government Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Wauchula, Florida, that will be expiring June 1, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,119 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,970 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years with one 5 year renewal option. The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2009. The delineated area is North bounded by: Rea Road; East bounded by: Peace River; South bounded by: Hwy 64; West bounded by:Dansby Road. 

Other applicable requirements include: 

• Parking: 20 on site paved parking spaces. 

• Others. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

• Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building. 

• List of building services provided. 

The Government’s decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<b>Description<br></b>
There is no solicitation to download.  The Mt. Hood National Forest – NOCA is seeking a qualified firm to provide professional Architectural and Engineering services for the preparation of the construction documents for the replacement of the main plumbing lines of potable water within Timberline Lodge.  Selection will be in accordance with the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firm.  The Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program applies (FAR Subpart 19.10). This procurement will be unrestricted and therefore is open to all businesses regardless of size. The primary NAICS is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.

<b>C.1  Scope of Work<br></b> 
(A) This Statement of Work defines the detailed requirements for the preparation of the construction documents (drawings, specifications, schedule of items, construction estimate and subsequent engineering design calculations) for the replacement of the main plumbing lines of potable water plumbing (hot and cold) within Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood National Forest, Oregon.  

(B) The design requires strict adherence to the Standards for Rehabilitation and the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (U.S. Department of Interior).  Preservation of the historic building will be the Contractor’s main requirement when designing the construction.

(C) The Contractor will have certain creative leniency during the design, barring the design is in agreement with all regulations and this statement of work.  The design will be in compliance with all pertinent governing codes, energy efficient, and at least cost to the government.
(D) State Compliance Requirements:
1.	U.S. Forest Service management policies require that all designs comply with state and local building codes, national standards, and federal design requirements, including all required permit processes.  The Contractor is responsible for identifying all permits that will be required.  
2.	The Contractor shall prepare a plan set for submission to the local/state authorities for review and approval.  The Contractor shall make all necessary changes required by the state from this review at no additional expense to the government.  All changes shall be incorporated into the Final construction documents. The state defines plan submittal requirements at the following website:  http://oregon.gov/DHS/ph/dwp/planreview.shtml

<b>C.2  Project Background<br></b>
(A) Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on Mt. Hood, Oregon.  It has served as a ski lodge and mountain retreat since 1937 and today sees approximately 2 million visitors each year.  The Lodge is located at timberline (6,000 feet) and therefore experiences extreme weather variations.  The current copper water pipes were installed in 1992 and have been failing at an increasing rate over the last 3 years.  The cause of failure was determined to be mostly Type 1 Cold Water Pitting with fewer cases of installation-caused failures and galvanic corrosion failures also existing.  The study recommended the use of heavier walled copper (type K or L), cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), or some combination when replacing the lines.

(B) There are no plans for major future development of the site at this time.  

(C) The plumbing to be replaced is located within the walls and floors, the two attics, the steam line corridors, and various other access tunnels.  Many of the lines cannot be seen in their entirety.  

<b>C.3  Project Location<br></b>
The project site is located on Mt. Hood approximately 3 miles north of Government Camp, Oregon, off State Highway 26.  

<b>C.4  Available Construction Funding and Project Schedule<br></b>
(A) The funding available for constructing this project is unknown.  The Construction Design and Estimate will enable the Forest Service to budget for the project in upcoming fiscal years.  It is anticipated that the construction costs will not exceed $1,000,000.  It is expected that the designer will develop a system that will adequately meet the needs of the Forest Service with industry standard components and service life without exceeding reasonable cost standards. 

(B) It is anticipated that the Construction Documents will be completed by the end of the 2009-2010 winter season and a construction solicitation will be let by the Forest Service in 2010 for construction to begin in the late summer of 2010.

<b>C.5  Government Rights<br></b>
(A)The Government shall have unlimited rights in all reports, drawings, designs, specifications, notes and other works developed in the performance of this contract without additional compensation paid to the A/E Contractor.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a delivery order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0008 for the identification, investigation, planning, and execution of viable Cost Reduction Initiatives (CRIs) for the Tomahawk Block IV missile. This effort includes CRI identification and analysis, the CRI approval process, CRI status reviews, and eventually implementation into the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk All Up Round (AUR) missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to identify, investigate, plan and execute viable CRIs, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-09-Q-2932. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. NUWC Division Newport intends to award a firm fixed-price contract to EDO Western Corp. of Salt lake City, UT for the development and implementation of a TR-317 Transducer retuning procedure. NUWC recently performed a TR-317 transducer usage analysis and determined that the projected usage rates for maintaining the TR-317 spherical array for the next five years will exceed the production and restoration output which will cause a critically low inventory. Therefore, it is imperative that NUWC explore every option to increase the restoration output.  EDO is the only company currently restoring TR-317 transducers and has developed an extensive database identifying TR-317 transducer failure modes as part of the TR-317 restoration process. Therefore, conducting a competitive procurement process will seriously impact the sche! dule for this critical research study. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. Additional information will be provided upon the release of RFQ N66604-09-Q-2932, expected to be on or about 20 April 2009.

<DESC>The Government requires that video from sensor and surveillance cameras is generated, displayed, recorded, archived, and mined over a network for key test parameters.  During live operations, video data generated will be displayed and recorded over a network in real time.

The on-site network will deploy wired and/or wireless components to extend reach as well as accommodate different sensors and cameras. However, each site may be different with regard to power availability, area footprint, and location of the command center.

Devices that need to be accommodated include, but are not limited to, next-generation sensors from the infrared, millimeter-wave, radar wave, and terahertz spectrum. We may also be using several different generations of video cameras – high definition, IP-based digital cameras, analog cameras, and smart cameras. The wireless network should be capable of supporting high-bandwidth needs ranging from a few megabits per second to hundreds of megabits per second.

It is imperative that any/all wireless transmissions be secured by open standards-based encryption such as WPA2/AES or better. This includes communications between any cameras/sensors, from cameras/sensors to access points, and between access points.

This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes.

The primary intent of this RFI is to explore innovative wireless technologies.  There is a need for a portable, wireless infrastructure on a heterogeneous network comprising smart cameras, high-definition surveillance cameras, and next-generation sensors. This wireless network will need to provide the following capabilities:

1.  Must operate indoors and/or outdoors. Must also provide rugged enclosure and mounting accessories to operate in an outdoor environment.
2.  Must be able to operate without disruption in areas with high amounts of wireless traffic (e.g. a large, public sporting event: US Tennis Open, NFL Superbowl, Olympic Games, etc.).
3.  High bandwidth capacity (greater than 500 megabit/sec) – we are exploring both line-of-site and non-line-of-site, wireless options.
4.  Resilience and scalability – either via mesh or via robust, self-reconfiguring setup, using multiple built-in radios, for client and backhaul, per access point.
5.  Power – we are seeking technologies that provide ALL FOUR of the following power options: Power over Ethernet (PoE 802.3AF), AC, DC, and battery-power as options on a single component. For example, we are not interested in technologies that only are powered by PoE. Each technology product must allow for the use of ALL FOUR of the power options identified above. Non-traditional power options (e.g., solar) could also be considered if justification can be provided for why this is a good solution.
6.  Security – supporting current open-source, standards-based encryption of transmitted data (e.g. WPA2, AES).
7.  Management software, if applicable, for access point control, firmware upgrade, and configuration.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  SOLICITATION NOTICE:  As authorized and partially funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a qualified prime contractor to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to provide for the Modernization of the IRS Service Center in Andover, MA.  The work includes, but is not limited to:

i)	This project is for the complete modernization of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Service Center in Andover, MA.  The IRS is consolidating, modernizing and transitioning its operations at the Andover Campus, impacting the Main Building located at 310 Lowell St., as well as other functions located at several leased locations in the area. The proposed project consists of the renovation of the 366,141RSF in the main building at the Andover, MA campus. The IRS will consolidate Accounts Management (AM) and Compliance Service (CS) functions into the main building, while phasing out submission processing (SP) of paper tax returns. The GSA has determined that renovating the existing Main Campus is the best and most viable housing alternative to fulfill the IRS’s requirements for consolidation of the offsite leases and modernization of the infrastructure. Renovating and retaining this facility will allow the government to continue to provide code compliant, state-of-the-art, secure, environmentally compliant, and energy efficient space in this large campus facility, strategically located off the I-93 highway.

ii)	The major components of the renovation work are included in the following items:
(1)	Superstructure: Seismic upgrades
(2)	Exterior Glazing and Doors: Window security upgrade and miscellaneous wall repairs
(3)	Partitions, Doors and Specialties: Lobby entry, toilet upgrades, handicap accessibility

(8)	Building Demolition and Abatement: Interior demolition and abatement of hazardous materials.
(9)	Roof replacement
(10)	Reconfiguration of entrance driveways and exterior security enhancements.
(11)	Removal and replacement of oil storage tank

The project will be completed in two phases to accommodate partial occupancy by the government during construction.  This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is approximately 28 months with each phase lasting 14 months..  The magnitude of construction is between $75,000,000 and $100,000,000.  The NAICS Code is 236220.  Size standard is $33.5 Mil.  All individuals working on this project will be required to obtain security clearances.

The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the greatest value concept.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the greatest value for the funds expended and not necessarily the lowest price.  The solicitation will require offerors to submit a technical and price proposal.  

Technical Evaluation:  The technical evaluation factors are Past Performance, Management Plan and Technical Approach to Completing Phased Building Occupied Construction Projects within Urban Developments, Key Personnel & Past Performance of Key Personnel, Subcontracting.

This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. Copies of this Solicitation (RFP), technical specifications and drawings will be available through the World Wide Web on or about 05/01/2009 @ www.fedbizopps.gov.  Contractors are responsible for printing the solicitation and all related documents.

"The General Services Administration strongly encourages participation by small businesses and the related socioeconomic categories of small disadvantaged, women-owned, service disabled veteran-owned and HUBZone businesses.

Following the conference, time will be allowed for a networking session for small, small disadvantaged, women owned, hubzone, service disabled veteran owned and large businesses to meet other prospective firms for possible subcontracting opportunities on this project.

<SUBJECT>Classified Waste Landfill
<SOLNBR>OPPORTUNITY504
<RESPDATE>042909
<CONTACT>John F. Sikkens, Phone 5052846302, Email jfsikke@sandia.gov
<DESC>Background Information:

From 1989 to 1993, Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) disposed of approximately 250 tons of Cold War legacy materials through burial in a roughly twelve foot deep unlined trench, now known as the TA-III Classified Waste Landfill, in Sandia’s Tech Area III in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Located within a five-acre Limited Area, these burials included classified (up through SRD) weapon components, hardware, and data according to relatively extensive inventory records compiled at the time.

Under a pending proposal to the State of New Mexico, New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), Sandia intends to completely excavate and empty the trench, destructively eliminate (demilitarize) the classified characteristics of all retrieved materials in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act and other regulations, process and dispose of all resulting wastes in accordance with current environmental regulations, and finally reseed and restore the site itself.  

Sandia proposed (Reference 1) five years, beginning in 2011, to complete the project; however, a much earlier start, including a possible start as early as Fiscal Year 2009, and much faster completion, as soon as Fiscal Year 2012 if feasible, would be highly desirable.

A range of alternative project execution options were studied to accomplish this work scope and schedule.  A recommended path forward is under consideration (Figure 1) which involves performing the excavation, sorting, and repacking the disinterred materials into handling containers locally under tent-like enclosures to provide visual protection of classified materials and prevent windblown loss. These sorted and repacked materials would then be moved into an immediately adjacent, roughly four-acre, Limited Area to the south of the existing landfill site for staging and demilitarization.  

The demilitarization facility is envisioned as a new, roughly 15,000 gross square foot metal warehouse-style building with a roughly 16 foot minimum internal height.  This structure would need to be tailored to the space, security, and safety basis requirements of hosting demilitarization and waste processing/shipping operations.  It is envisioned that one side of the building would be reserved for staging and storage of materials awaiting demilitarization or shipment, while the other side would be equipped with a series of internal containment enclosures housing the actual demilitarization workstations.  To accommodate the staging and handling of classified materials, this structure would need to be built, equipped, and operated to Vault-Type Room (VTR) standards.  To maximize the use of floor space and eliminate the need for maintenance personnel in the VTR, the demilitarization workstation enclosures would be ducted and exhausted to external Local Exhaust and Ventilation (LEV) systems, including high efficiency dust collector filtration systems, DOE-qualified HEPA filtration systems, exhaust fans, and exhaust stacks.  To maximize the safety of all operations, the same approach would be applied to all building HVAC systems and to charging stations for electric forklifts and other equipment.  To support shipping functions, the facility will need be equipped with overhead vehicle doors and sealed concrete floors designed to support heavy equipment.  Finally, the facility would need to be equipped with office space, restrooms, break area, locker room and showers, and safety showers.

Site improvements to support this demilitarization approach would necessarily include the Limited Area boundary and security infrastructure, as well as a small gravel parking area for the workforce.  In addition, the need to reliably meet potential NMED-imposed schedule requirements will likely drive the need for up to forty shipping containers, equipped to serve as VTR storage, to accommodate the surge resulting from the initial excavation and sorting process.  These storage units would be added only as required to accommodate the surge and would be emptied and eliminated as quickly as the demilitarization pace would allow.

 Sandia desires to assess the level of interest, if any, from potentially qualified commercial teams in accomplishing the Remediation of Sandia’s TA-III Classified Waste Landfill.  The Probable Scope of Work to be addressed is defined below, along with a draft set of Mandatory Qualifications that would be used to define potentially qualified teams, if any.  Sandia seeks expressions of potential interest from potentially qualified teams who would potentially be interested in pursuing the full Probable Scope of Work as defined.  Other project approaches suggested by potential qualified vendors which satisfy the site remediation and material demilitarization goals will be considered.

Probable Scope of Work:

With regard to facilities construction, provide all materials, workforce, capabilities, construction financing, and other resources required to execute completion of all necessary site improvements, facilities, and infrastructure as described above, including the procurement and outfitting of any temporary shipping container VTR staging facilities required to meet any operational surge from the excavation and sorting processes.

With regard to excavation and sorting requirements, provide all required excavation and sorting equipment, supplies, expertise, and workforce including Q-cleared personnel, to accomplish these tasks in a manner that fully meets all potential environmental, safety, security requirements.

With regard to demilitarization and waste disposition requirements, provide all required demilitarization equipment, supplies, and expertise, including Q-cleared workforce, to accomplish these tasks in a manner that fully meets all potential environmental, safety, security requirements.

Potentially qualified teams should have relevant experience, through either employees or subcontractors who would be assigned to the project, in:
1. The planning, design, engineering, construction financing, and completion of site improvements, facilities, and infrastructure of similar complexity and scale to those described above.
2. Site or facilities remediation and restoration efforts, including excavation followed by restoration of surface contours and native plantscapes, of similar complexity and scale to those described above.
3. The handling, demilitarization, and disposition of classified materials, including weapon components, hardware, and data, as well as the resulting wastes in efforts of similar complexity and scale to those described above.
4. Dealing with the potential for hazardous materials, Special Nuclear Materials, explosives, or liquids and with the potential for hazardous, mixed, and low-level radioactive waste products. 

Potentially qualified teams should have the capability to obtain all necessary financing and resources and initiate work in FY09.

Services of a qualified A-E firm are sought to provide professional engineering services for all aspects of dam and levee inspections.  Contract work is intended primarily for projects within the geographical boundary of the Mississippi Valley Division (MVD).  However, work may be awarded for projects located outside the MVD boundary on an approved basis as determined by the Contracting Officer.  This contract may be used to support the National Levee Inspection Program.  Subject to program requirements, the Government intends to negotiate and award two small business set-aside indefinite delivery contracts within one year after the required response date to this announcement, but reserves the right to award up to two additional small business set-aside indefinite delivery contracts (a maximum total of four contracts).  The contracts will be awarded in the order of ranking determined by the selection approval authority.  Each contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four option periods not to exceed one year each.  The amount of work in each contract period will not exceed $1,200,000 ($6,000,000 total per contract).  However, an option period may be exercised at the Governments sole discretion when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  Furthermore, any unused capacity may be rolled over to the next contract period at the Governments sole discretion.  Yearly rate schedules with annual cost escalation will be negotiated for the contracts.  On each individual contract, the first years rate schedule shall become effective the day of contract award, and shall be in effect for 1 year from contract award.  Subsequent rate schedules shall become effective on the yearly anniversary dates from contract award.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed-price task orders, not to exceed the contract amount.  The Contracting Officer will consider the following and other relevant factors in deciding which Contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, geographic location, and equitable distribution of work among Contractors.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and supplements thereto.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications to accomplish the required work.  This contract is set aside for small businesses only.

<DESC><p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp; </strong>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is conducting market research for the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp; The United States Department of Education has a requirement for a large, complex data collection that assesses how students and their parents pay for college. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is designed to collect information on a nationally representative sample of students attending postsecondary institutions. The study provides information about the costs of postsecondary education and how students and their families meet these costs. Contract options include: conducting the full-scale study in 2011 instead of 2012 (Option 1); state-representative samples of students enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and for-profit institutions (Option 2); supplementing the sample size and questionnaire content to meet specific policy interests (Options 3 and 4, respectively); examining the effectiveness of offering incentives to increase participation of sampled students and postsecondary institutions (Options 5); identifying and following-up first-time beginning postsecondary students in the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal studies of 2014 and 2017 and identified as BPS:12/14 and BPS:12/17 (Options 6 and 7, respectively); collecting high school transcript data during BPS:12/14 (Option 8); collecting postsecondary transcript data during BPS:12/17 (Option 9); collecting financial aid data from institutions students attended in 2011-2014 as part of BPS:12/14 (Option 10); collecting financial aid data from institutions students attended in 2014-2017 as part of BPS:12/17 (Option 11), and matching students that were in the BPS:04/06/09 cohort to various administrative databases in 2011 to see if anyone obtained degrees beyond BPS:04/09 (Option 12). Data will be collected primarily via the web and include self-administered, telephone interview, and fieldwork. Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will be web-based.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.  
The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure.  Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide.  Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out.  The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise.  The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform.  In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism.

In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program.  The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012.  Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract.  In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).  
In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs.  The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.)  
The projected start date is January 2010.  Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas. 

•Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States;

•Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities;

•Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises;

•Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials;
 
•Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives;

•Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance;

•Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs;

•Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms);

•Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems;

•Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure; 

•Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads;

•Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders;

•Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities;

•Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations;

•Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.  Establish and verify schedules and performance of transport services as well as establish and maintain key relationships associated with movement of WMD;

•Provide Subject Matter Experts with expertise in the transportation infrastructure of CTR partner countries capable of detailed investigation into tariffs, regulations, certifications, ad hoc support requests or to attend project meetings between government agencies relating to the movement of weapons of WMD and/or associated components;

•Provide ability to establish and manage contract(s) with transportation vehicle maintenance facilitie(s) to conduct and verify maintenance as required to maintain applicable certifications relating to WMD transport vehicles and;

•If authorized, apply CTR resources to the elimination of conventional arms, munitions and their associated infrastructure.

Contractors who believe that they posses the expertise and experience to fulfill all of these requirements and their complex systems engineering activities are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing each of these areas in writing.  Interested contractors should also address whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules.  Please send responses via e-mail to CTRC_INFO@dtra.mil by close of business on 12 March 09.  Please limit your response to no more than five pages (size: 8.5”x 11” pages, with 1” margins), using Times New Roman 12 pt font or equivalent, and submitted in Microsoft Word 2003 or Adobe PDF formats.  Also include information such as: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and whether your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. (4) Is your firm a certified HUBZone firm (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. All information received in this RFI that is marked “Proprietary” will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Agency currently intends to host an Industry Day conference on 24 March 2009.  The purpose of the conference is to provide additional information on CTR requirements and give industry an opportunity to seek further information on the acquisition.  Additional information regarding this conference will be posted on both DTRA and FBO.gov websites (links will be provided in a subsequent modification to this announcement).  Specific information such as date, time, and number of allotted people per company will be addressed in the upcoming Industry Day announcement. In order to gauge the amount of interest for Industry Day, please send your company name, point of contact, phone, and e-mail address to CTRC_INFO@dtra.mil.

PROJECT DETAILS:  J Clark Salyer National NWR is located in Upham, ND, approximately 70 miles northwest of Minot.  The Refuge is approximately 58,700 acres, containing about 34 miles of road which are predominately gravel and some native surfacing.  Approximately 75 miles of the Souris River meanders through the Refuge.  The project area is flat with little to no hilly terrain. 
	


	This project is located within the 12 mile stretch of road that begins at the Willow-Upham Road and ends at the intersection of Route 14.  This section of the Refuge road is called the Scenic Auto Tour Route.  The project work consists of the reconstruction of the Willow Creek Bridge and approaches to the bridge.

Bridge Construction

The Willow Creek Bridge is currently a single span, steel girder bridge that contains a timber transverse nail laminated deck.  The bridge is single lane and is approximately 27’ in length and about 15.5’ wide.  There is existing railings on the bridge.  The superstructure is made of steel beams supporting a timber deck planks. The abutment foundations are assumed to be on spread footings.  The substructure consists of vertical concrete abutment walls with flared wings.  

The project work will require the removal of the bridge.  In addition, survey and staking and structure excavation will be required for the construction of the new bridge.  The new bridge will be a two-lane single span, having a superstructure that is precast prestressed concrete bulb girders, with a cast-in-place deck.  The substructure (foundation) will be steel H piles with concrete caps.  The new bridge railings are concrete, New Jersey safety shape.  The new bridge railings will be transitioned into standard guardrail at the ends. 

The Willow Creek bridge will be constructed on its existing alignment.
Approximately 2500 ft2 of riprap slope protection will be constructed underneath the bridge.
  
The portion of road leading to the bridge will be reconstructed to meet the new bridge approaches.   This work will include minor earthwork (excavation) and placement of 8” of roadway aggregate base.  The total length of the approach work is approximately 1100 ft. 

The construction of the bridge is expected to take between 3-4 months.  It is anticipated that the bridge will be constructed in one season.  Construction is estimated to begin in June 2009. and the estimated price range is $500K to $800K.

The Contractor shall use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module of RMS, referred to as QCS, to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period. This joint Government-Contractor use of RMS and QCS will facilitate electronic exchange of information and overall management of the contract.

Quality control<BR>d.  Submittal monitoring<BR>e.  Scheduling<BR>f.  Import/export of data<BR><BR>The Contractor shall be responsible for quality control and shall establish and maintain an effective quality control system that consists of plans, procedures, and organization necessary to produce an end product that complies with the contract requirements. The system shall cover all on-site construction operations and shall be keyed to the proposed construction sequence. The Contractor shall utilize established in-house quality control procedures to assure full compliance with all off-site work. The Contractor shall submit daily reports for all on-site work and for all off-site work.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Pages/EM385-1-1,2008NEW!.aspx located at US Army Corps of Engineers homepage.<BR><BR>This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.  Only firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement of their current or past technical experience (what the firm has done) and current or past performance(how well the firm did it) similar to or the same as the requirements stated above, will be used in the determination whether to set aside this requirement.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT DESCRIPTION: MARKET RESEARCH. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for potential sources to manufacture a Body Armor System Combat Vehicle Crewmen (BASC). The BASC system will require a body armor solution that allows Combat Vehicle Crewmen (CVC) Commanders to tailor protection to the mission, situation and environment.  Conceptually the BASC will be worn over the CVC coverall and consist of: a soft armor vest (SAV) meeting the ballistic requirements, and at least the area of coverage, of CO/PD 00-02G; a plate carrier (PC) to allow the use and appropriate adjustment (to adjust and retain proper position) of E-SAPI plates (front, back and sides);  either an integrated capability (MOLLE/PALS) to carry a minimum load of six (6) M-16/M-4 magazines, two (2) 9mm magazines and one (1) Improved First Aid Kit (IFAK), or a quickly detachable carrier with the same capacity (i.e., Chest Rig). ! The back of the SAV shall cover to the base of the spine while seated. The SAV must have an extraction strap capable of lifting an unconscious Marine (up to 250 lbs) vertically through a combat vehicle hatch.  All components shall be flame resistant, anti-static and anti-microbial and compatible with the CVC coverall, CVC helmet, USMC hydration system, and Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE).  
Small Arms Vest Attributes:  The SAV shall be front-opening with a reliable closure that allows rapid donning and doffing, be designed so as to minimize/eliminate snag hazards, incorporate removable throat, yoke, collar assemblies, and groin protection, as well as, a detachable rifle bolsters that can be located on either shoulder. 
PC Attributes:  The PC shall have no inherent soft armor (unless required for adequate coverage of side E-SAPI), allow for rapid donning and doffing, be designed so as to minimize/eliminate snag hazards and, should a cummerbund be used, the side E-SAPI will be internally carried.  When worn with the SAV, the PC shall not prevent the use of the extraction handle on either the SAV or the CVC coverall.  The PC shall be capable of quick doffing in an emergency situation. 
Load Carriage:  If a separate load-carriage solution is used, it shall be capable of easy attachment/detachment.  When attached, it shall remain in place throughout violent motion when fully loaded and must be capable of separate storage in the vehicle.  A detachable carrier must be capable of prolonged use in austere operational environments and must be able to support the weight of the combat load described above.
A copy of Purchase Description Body Armor, Multiple Threat/Interceptor, CO/PD 00-02G is being provided as an attachment to this sources sought in order to familiarize respondents with the format and general information that will be provided in the final technical data package. The primary differences between the information provide in CO/PD 00-02G and the final technical data package will be related to patterns and the use of coyote brown 498 in place of Universal Camouflage.

Its purpose is to identify opportunities for Air Force and Industry research and development, and to enhance AMC strategy for future POM inputs. AMC's FUMO Wargame will also support the Air Force's Future Capabilities Game.</p>
<p>The first FUMO planning conference will be held at Scott AFB, 12-14 May 09. During this FUMO planning conference, government representatives (wargame players) will develop study questions that will be answered during wargame execution (scheduled for August). As industry representatives at this first planning conference, your role will be to gain an insight into the development of those study questions so that your company can provide a conceptual air vehicle, materiel solution, in response to the study questions during the second planning conference. We believe your company's analytical expertise is very valuable in the development of future air mobility concepts and capabilities.</p>
<p>The second planning conference will be held, 14-16 July, 2009, at Scott AFB. Industry representatives may be offered an opportunity to present possible solutions or ideas based upon on those questions developed at the first planning conference applicable to your company's area of expertise.</p>
<p>Note: Interested companies should plan on attending both planning conferences.</p>
<p>Note: This is not a solicitation for competitive bid, nor will it obligate the government to any contractual action. Attendance is strictly voluntary and at contractor's expense. The government will not reimburse any costs related to contractor attendance.</p>
<p>Note: These planning conferences will be classified at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>If your company plans to attend the planning conferences, or needs additional information, please contact Mr. Bob Nagel, HQ AMC, (618) 229-4059; email: <a href="mailto:bob.nagel@scott.af.mil">bob.nagel@scott.af.mil</a>.</p>
<p>If attending, request your Security Manager send your security information either through the Joint Personnel Adjudicator System (JPAS) (SMO Code: SF1LFS3H6) or FAX a visitor request letter with security information to Mr. Nagel at (618) 256-4017.</p>

<DESC><p>Title: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman Spectroscopy - SEMSCA
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, firm fixed price, sole source contract to Renishaw, Inc., 5277 Trillium Blvd, Hoffman Estates, IL 60192 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source Available. The FBI requires a Scanning Electron Microscope Structural Chemical Analyzer (SEMSCA) in order to attach and interface JEOL, Inc.'s Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the Renishaw, Inc.'s Raman Spectrometer. The SEM is a stand-alone instrument that uses a high powered electron beam to create magnified images up to 250,000x of a sample. The Raman Spectrometer is a stand alone instrument that provides chemical information about a sample through its lasers interaction with the specimen at 10x-50x magnification. By connecting these two stand alone instruments, it will enhance the capabilities of both units by allowing the SEM to obtain chemical information on the image of interest as well as magnify the Raman Spectrometer's image to 25,000x - 5,000x its normal ability. Based on extensive market research conducted with knowledgeable individuals in Government and the related industry, Renishaw, Inc. is the only responsible source that can provide an internal upgrade to its own product, the Raman Spectrometer, and Renishaw is the only known vendor with the SEMSCA attachment, to include hardware and software, that can customize and ensure compatibility to the FBI's existing JEOL, Inc.'s SEM system.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit quotes to this office by 2:00 PM, EST, Monday, April 27, 2009, via facsimile to the attention of Mrs. Dina Olibah, Contract Specialist, at (703) 814-4787 or by e-mail at Dina.Olibah@ic.fbi.gov.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY  -  Managerial and Oversight Support for the EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund (Modification 38)
<SOLNBR>EP-C-06-026
<ARCHDATE>06152009
<CONTACT>David A Plagge, Contracting Officer, Phone (513) 487-2022, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email plagge.david@epa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Modification 38 is to obligate $620,000 in support of three work assignments (WA 3-100; WA 3-101; and WA 3-102).  The period of performance for these work assignments will be from April 8, 2009 though March 31, 2010.   The modification also incorporates into the contract clauses required for contracts involving ARRA funded activities.

WA 3-100 is to develop tools to assist the EPA’s Office of Wastewater Management’s State Revolving Fund Branch to properly manage and provide oversight for funds provide to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) under the ARRA.  The tools to be developed under this work assignment include a checklist to be used by EPA Regional SRF staff to review and monitor ARRA funds provided to CWSRF borrowers to ensure that the funds are being used properly and effectively.  The contractor shall also develop guidelines for State SRF programs to monitor and oversee how the federal ARRA funds are being used and to ensure that all federal and State requirements are being followed.

WA 3-101 is to support EPA in ensuring that States and EPA Regions understand data entry issues associated with ARRA reporting in the existing CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) database.  This will include supporting EPA’s efforts to facilitate reporting transparency, and to develop, update, and expand a portfolio of reports on the environmental and economic impact of CWSRF loans made with ARRA funds.

WA 3-102 is to provide support to EPA in developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy for the Green Project Reserve provisions of the ARRA.  Key tasks include providing logistical support for EPA in responding to inquiries regarding new ARRA Green Project Reserve implementation, outreach and training, assistance to States soliciting Green Project Reserve applications, oversight and tracking and reporting. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget’s guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency’s Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government’s risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.

Their mission is toimprove government and industry preparedness in the field of C4ISR throughcooperation, association, and the encouragement of education in relatedtechnical fields.The annual symposium has become one of the most informative, broad-basedtechnical exchange forums of its scale.  It flows naturally from the annualWEST trade show occurring in San Diego each winter.  This years symposium isfocused specifically on the interests of the San Diego community andopportunities within reach.  The 2009 C4ISR Symposium will feature three daysof forward-looking briefings, panel discussions, and product displays fromseven organizations vital to the San Diego-based Defense Industrial community.Each is charged with developing, procuring, and/or delivering crucial buildingblocks that are pivotal to the security of our nation.  Industry will bepresenting industrys perspectives via panel discussions, displaying theirwares in exhibits, as well as sponsoring the event.  Our government co-sponsorsfor this event will be SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, JPEO JTRS, PEO C4I, PEOEIS, PEO Space Systems, DHS S&T, and MCTSSA.On Tuesday, May 5, the multi-disciplinary Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter, Pacific will co-host the day.  The day will be directed by CommandingOfficer Captain Mark Kolheim, Technical Director Carmela Keeney, and keyProgram Managers.  They will discuss examples of their diverse roles, rangingfrom fielding and upgrading technology and supporting elements of the GIG toconceiving, developing, testing, and conducting sophisticated Science andTechnology demonstrations of crucial importance and interest to a broadspectrum of defense and other national agencies.  Tuesdays events will alsoinclude an Industry Panel during lunch and presentations by the Department ofHomeland Security Science and Technology (DHS S&T) Directorate.On Wednesday, May 6, the Joint Program Executive Office Joint Tactical RadioSystem (JPEO JTRS) will co-host the second day of the symposium.  Mr. DennisBauman and his team will present a full-range discussion of JPEO JTRSprograms.  JPEO JTRS will deliver their message about the JTRS capability tofellow local industry, government, and military contacts, and to listen tovalued input and feedback.  Wednesdays schedule will also highlight the workof the AFCEA Education Foundation during lunch and a new entry to thesymposium, Program Executive Office (PEO) Space Systems in the afternoon.Thursday, May 7th  will be co-hosted by the Program Executive Office (PEO)C4I.  Mr. Chris Millers technical staff members and industry partners join todiscuss major programs within the PEO.  The program will detail significanttechnology important to the PEO C4I Masterplan, with technical portfoliodiscussions on applications, communications, networks, and platform integrationwith a special emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  Presentations willspark an earnest and candid discourse between industry and military partners.Such a dialog is crucial to mutual success in delivering capabilities of thewarfighter that will ensure their mission accomplishment.  Thursday will alsoinclude presentations by two other new symposium co-sponsors, Program ExecutiveOffice for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) and the Marine CorpseTactical Systems Support Activity.The San Diego Convention Center is this years venue.  The symposium will hostseveral networking events, allowing government and industry to exchangeinformation.  The goal of this exchange is to give industry the opportunity toinvest in the correct technology to be competitive and to bring the governmentthe best-value team for product development.  The event also allows thegovernment to learn what industry has to offer, encouraging the best solutionsfor warfighter needs, wants, and expectations.The AFCEA Education Foundation Golf Tournament will be held on Friday May 8,2009 in association with the Symposium.  The tournament will take place at theRiverwalk Golf Club in Mission Valley, San Diego.All proceeds benefit the AFCEA San Diego Educational Foundation for the purposeof public grants and scholarships for aspiring students who will be our futureengineers and scientists.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA: F34608-98-H-5013-0044. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance.

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial;">CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY - Development of Indirect and Induced Employment Estimates Associated with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Projects
<SOLNBR>31-10-9007
<RESPDATE>042209
<CONTACT>Melissa Hogan, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 366-9771, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email melissa.hogan@dot.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER FHWA IDIQ CONTRACTS DTFH61-07-D-00009, DTFH61-07-D-00010, DTFH61-07-D-00011, DTFH61-07-D-00012, DTFH61-07-D-00013.

BACKGROUND

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) promising “not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.”  That focus on jobs is codified in the law under Section 1201(c)(2) (underlining added).

(2) CONTENTS OF REPORTS. — For amounts received under each covered program by a grant recipient under this Act, the grant recipient shall include in the periodic reports information tracking-

(F) the number of direct, on-project jobs created or sustained by the Federal funds provided for projects under the appropriation and, to the extent possible, the estimated indirect jobs created or sustained in the associated supplying industries, including the number of job-years created and the total increase in employment since the date of enactment of this Act; and

(3) TIMING OF REPORTS. — Each grant recipient shall submit the first of the 
periodic reports required under this subsection not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act and shall submit updated reports not later than 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after such date of enactment.

There is a need to develop a unified approach to the estimation of indirect and induced employment associated with ARRA projects.  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is interpreting the language of Section 1201 as requiring, for purposes of estimating “the total increase in employment since the date of enactment of this Act,” to include an estimate of the number of induced jobs created.  Currently, estimates of induced jobs for different types of projects are subject to differing assumptions imbedded in the economic models used for these estimates.  In addition, for all aspects of this Task Order a “job” shall be defined as equivalent to 2,080 hours commonly referred to as a “job-year.” 

In addition, the induced employment estimate needs to use the assumptions used by the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) in their ARRA employment reports (where “induced” jobs are referred to as “indirect” jobs).  The CEA is expected to use assumptions comparable to those used by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein in their January 9, 2009, analysis, available at http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf.  

Although this Task Order is issued through Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) the project is to estimate the indirect and induced employment for all the DOT modes.

OBJECTIVES

The key tasks to be completed under the scope of this Task Order are as follows: 

Task 1 -- Meet the reporting requirements of the ARRA by providing an estimate of indirect and induced jobs by program and by grant recipient for the 90-day, 180-day, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year reports.

Task 2 -- Provide written descriptions of and documentation for the estimates in Task 1.  This material shall specifically detail all aspects of the estimation.

Task 3 -- Develop model(s) with a user interface for ad hoc estimates to provide to the DOT operating administrations and to the FHWA Division Offices.

Task 4 -- Respond to DOT questions and issues as needed for inquires from the Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the DOT Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and others.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a fixed price purchase order for a BioNumerics Module version 5.1 for Fingerprint Types.  

Project Title:  BioNumerics Additional Licenses

Background:  The Office of Regulatory Science, Divisions of Microbiology, intends to purchase six additional licenses of BioNumerics software.  We currently use a 2-user BioNumerics network license to interface with the PulseNet databases housed at the CDC.  We use this interface to share DNA fingerprint data from food-related bacterial isolates with our state and federal partners.  As our needs grow, we are requiring additional Division of Microbiology personnel to use this software to contribute data to this growing database as well as assist with data analysis and interpretation.  Additional licenses are required to allow for growth of our databases.   Six additional licenses will allow eight Division of Microbiology users to be accessing the software simultaneously.
Our current BioNumerics licenses consist of the following v. 5.1 modules:  Fingerprint Types, Character Types, Sequence Types, Comparison and Cluster Analysis, Identification and Libraries and Database Sharing Tools.  Additionally, we have needed the use of the v 5.1 Dimensioning and Statistics Module for further data analysis.  Any future add-on licenses of this software must be an equivalent version of BioNumerics and identical module configuration to our existing license in order to be compatible.

	(a)  Recording hereunder shall be taken by reporters qualified in the operation of Steno-type equipment, Real Time recording, Computer Aided Transcription (CAT), Shorthand and/or monitored Multi-Microphone recording systems, and when permitted by the Presiding Official.   At the request of the USAO, recording shall also be taken by videotape.  Regardless of the type of equipment used, it is mandatory that there be an accurate read back capability and that a back-up system be utilized.  It is also mandatory that tape recording devices shall have a separate monitor head which shall allow the reporter to monitor the recorded tape.
	
 

1.	Monitored Multi-microphone Recording Systems.  The mandatory requirements follow: 
	
•	The Contractor's personnel shall operate and monitor the recording equipment at all times. 
•	The operating personnel shall provide to the USAO, prior to the commencement of each proceeding, a certification that the equipment is turned on and operating. 
•	The recording equipment utilized shall provide for the instant playback of testimony.  
•	The equipment shall be capable of recording as many as twenty-three grand jurors together in one room with the prosecutor and the witness. 
•	The system utilized shall have a back-up system to allow continuous recording of speakers.  The Grand Jury hearings shall not be stopped for any reason such as the changing of a tape. 
•	The tapes shall be of such quality that there shall be no instances of inaudibility because of accents or words used by the speakers.  
•	The system shall be portable to allow for transportation of tapes to another location when an immediate decision is required by a Federal District Court Judge. 
•	The recording monitor shall be able to identify speakers.  
•	A back-up system shall be available so as not to delay the proceedings.  
•	The equipment utilized shall not pose any safety hazards due to exposed wires, cords, or for any other reason.

	
2.	Real Time Recording. The steno machine is attached to the computer.  As the steno types the strikes/words are translated into English onto the screen.
	
3.	Computer Aided Transcription (CAT). With this type of system, the  steno strikes a key which is written onto a disk.  The disk is inserted into an attachment to the computer and the information is brought up on the computer screen.  A back-up voice tape is made also so that a reverification can be made of the transcript.

4.	Video Tape Recording.  The Government must determine video formatting, DVD or  CD. 
	
	(b)  The Contractor, or the duly authorized employee, agent, or representative of the Contractor, shall present himself/herself to the person in charge of the proceedings and he shall at all times be governed by the instructions of the Presiding Official in matters affecting the composition of the record, adjournment to other times or places, and matters of like character.
	
	(c)  Depositions shall be taken by a Contractor-furnished reporter who must be a duly authorized notary for the State or District in which the deposition is held.  Reporters are required to comply with Rules 28 and 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and specifically Rule 30(e), which provides in pertinent part as follows:
	
	"If requested by the deponent or a party before completion of the deposition, the deponent shall have 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which to review the transcript or recording and, if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons given by the deponent for making  them.  The  officer  shall  indicate  in  the  certificate prescribed by subdivision (f)(1) whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any changes made by the deponent during the period allowed."
	
	The Contractor must give the Government its copy prior to the witness being presented their testimony.  The Government may choose to present the deposition to the witness.  In the event further information is desired, the above referenced volume is a part of the United States Code, Title 28 and may be found at any public library.
	
	(d)  Everything spoken pertaining to the subject matter of the deposition shall be reported, unless the Presiding Official otherwise directs.  No part of any proceedings, of which notes have been taken as required, shall be omitted from the record, unless the Presiding Official so directs.
	
	(e)  All notes, records, documentary exhibits, and any other material which is a part of, or relates to, any action recorded by the Contractor shall be the property of the United States and shall be delivered to the ordering office, together with furnished transcript, unless otherwise instructed. 
	
	(f)  Right to Remove Individual Reporter - It shall be an absolute right of the Government to inform the Contractor through the Contracting Officer of the unacceptability of specific court reporters for Grand Jury or Deposition work.  The failure of the Contractor to provide a court reporter other than one designated unacceptable by the Government shall provide a basis for the Government's decision to obtain court reporting services from another source.
	
	Transcript Format 
	
	(a)  A separate transcript shall be provided for each witness/deponent.  The title page shall show the name of the witness/deponent, Grand Jury date, time of the commencement of the proceeding for that particular witness, docket number, the date of proceedings, the name, title and address of the attorney appearing for the Government, caption of matter, the authority for taking the deposition, etc. and shall be followed by a page of distinctive color indexing the exhibits where applicable.
	
	(b)  The paging of the transcripts shall be in a single series by consecutive numbers regardless of the number of days consumed in the hearings, proceeding, etc., and the paging of the transcript in a hearing shall follow consecutively the paging of the last previous hearing in the same case.
	
	(c)  Each copy of the transcript furnished the Government shall be bound with covers of good quality, white or colored 140 pound index paper, #1 sulphite paper, heavy weight transparent plastic, or similar material approved by the ordering office.  Transcripts shall be punched with three holes at the left side; the upper and lower holes to be two inches from top and bottom of the page, third hole in the center of the resulting interval, and shall be secured with a suitable fastener of permanent nature. Velobinding is not acceptable for binding the transcripts.
	
	(d)  All transcripts shall be typed with black ribbon or reproduced by regular office type duplicating machines on white linen unglazed paper of good quality, #30 white bond paper or similar stock, to be approved by the ordering office.  Transcripts shall be typed on paper 8 ½ inches x 11 inches in size, with a ruled margin of 1 3/4 inches at the left side and 3/8 inch at the right side.  Typing shall be 10 spaces to the inch, double spaced, and shall not be less than 25 lines to the page exclusive of the line containing the witness name, date of testimony, and page number.  The lines of testimony are to be numbered on each page beginning with #1.  These numbers will appear just to the left of the left ruled margin.  Whenever testimony is continuous, requiring more than one line, the typing shall begin one blank space after the left hand ruled margin and shall continue to the right hand ruled margin, with no blank spaces.  The distance between the left hand ruled margin and the right hand ruled margin will be 6 3/8 inches.  Therefore, there will be no less than 60 characters per line available.  No word should wrap to the next line that would properly fit within the 60 count.  Pages necessarily containing less than 25 lines shall be charged and paid for at the full-page rate.  No payment will be made for lines in excess of 25 lines to the page.  The first line of Q and A's will be indented 5 spaces, then followed by a period and 3 blank spaces.  The second line will return to one blank space after the left hand ruled margin.  The first line of colloquy will be indented 10 spaces, followed by a period and 3 blank spaces.  The second line will return to one blank space after the left hand ruled margin.  No extraneous words should be used on the title page or at the beginning of a witness' testimony.  No statement that can properly fit on a line should be extended to an additional line.  There should be no unnecessary blank lines unless absolutely necessary for readability.  The USAO will be the sole judge of this format.
	
	Reduced page transcripts (Condensed Transcripts) shall include four transcript pages in reduced format on a single 8 ½ x 11 inch page.
	
	(e)  Exhibits admitted in evidence, identified in a deposition, or in Grand Jury proceedings, when requested by the Government attorney shall be stamped, marked, numbered by the Contractor, and arranged in numerical order, as directed by the individual Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and shall be annexed to the deposition transcript.   The marking shall indicate clearly whether the exhibit is offered by the complainant, protestant, intervener, defendant, respondent, applicant, the ordering office, or other party of record.  The numbering of exhibits shall be in a single series of consecutive numbers, regardless of the number of days consumed in the hearing, unless otherwise directed by the Presiding Official.  The number of exhibits introduced at a hearing or in a reopened case shall follow consecutively the number on the last previous exhibit introduced by such party.  Exhibits shall not be copied into the record nor shall photostatic copies of exhibits for inclusion in the record be made by the reporter unless the Presiding Official so directs.
	
	
	Availability/Sale of Transcripts 
	
	(a)  Recording of proceedings shall be transcribed by the Contractor only when directed by the USAO.  In the handling of transcripts, the Contractor shall observe and comply with security requirements stipulated herein.  Copies of transcripts will not be made available to the public.

	SECTION H
	SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
	
H.1 Personnel Security

(a)  The USAO will process background security investigations for Grand Jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract.  Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to Grand Jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval.  If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to Grand Jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's total loss of access approval for Grand Jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

(b)  The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract.  This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants.  No employee may be used on Grand Jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

(c)  Should Grand Jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor; additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17.  In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies.
 
(d)  In the event the USAO is unable to obtain security approval for access to Grand Jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for Grand Jury court reporters. 

(e)  The Contractor agrees to ensure any subcontractor proposed for the furnishing of supplies and services which will involve access to Grand Jury information in the Contractor's custody has the appropriate employment security approval in effect prior to being afforded access to Grand Jury information.

H.2 Required Security Investigation

(a)  The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder.  The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

(b) Risk Level

	In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk 		categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:

 	Policy development or implementation

	
 	Higher-level management assignment
	
 	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,
	
 	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 
	
				IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation 
				of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a 
				computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a 
				system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with 
				relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant 
				personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, 
				Management of Federal 	Information Resources, “ for those computer 
				positions that are High Risk at:
				 http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html
	
	Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:
	

 	Assistance to policy development and implementation,
	
 	Mid-level management assignments,
	
 	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,
	
 	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,
	
 	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources, “ for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).
	
	Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.
		
	(c)  Types and Numbers of Background Investigations
	
	Work performed under this CONTRACT will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 3.2.2(b).  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this CONTRACT.
	 
	The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the CONTRACT until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.
	
	During the life of the CONTRACT, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.
	
	(d) Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers
	
	Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the Security Programs Manager, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 
	
	High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.
	
	Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subject’s background during the past 5 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.
	
		Low Risk Positions.  The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of 	Investigation Name and Fingerprint check.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted 	following a favorable NCIC check.
	
	(e)  The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below.  The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.
	
	Form Number and Title 		Number of Copies
	FD-258 Fingerprint Card		2
	SF 85P - Questionnaire For Public Trust Positions		2
	
	(f) Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations
	
	Contractor’s Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the CONTRACT or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this CONTRACT, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the CONTRACT.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this CONTRACT:
	
	1. Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 
	
	2. Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form DD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.
	
	3. Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.
	
	4. Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.
	
	(g)  Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)
	
	Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 
	
	(h)  Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.
	
	Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the CONTRACT.
	
	Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)
	
	Infamous or disgraceful conduct  (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)
	
	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.
	
	Current and continuing alcohol abuse
	
	Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment  (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)
	
	Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)
	
	Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)
	
	Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)
	
	Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)
	
	Previous security violations  (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)
	
	Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 
	
	Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individual’s immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)
	
	Foreign Preference (e.g. and individual’s behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)
	
	(i)  Mitigating Factors   When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.
	
	1. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.
	
	2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.
	
	3. The frequency and recency of the conduct.
	
	4. The individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct.
	
	5. The voluntaries of participation.
	
	6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral changes.
	
	7. The motivation for the conduct.
	
	8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.
	
	9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
	
	(j)  Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the CONTRACT falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this CONTRACT.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.
	
	(k)  The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already business on the CONTRACT and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.
	
	(l) The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the CONTRACT, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).
		
	(m)  The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.
	
	(n)  The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.
	
	(o)  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held momentarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  
	
	(p)  Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.
	
	(q)  Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.
	
	H.3 Contractor Physical Security Requirements
	
(a)	Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:

o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practical after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 
	
	
	(b)  An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed and connected to a central station at the Contractor’s facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitors the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of an alarm activation.  Central station burglar alarm systems classified by the Underwriter’s Laboratories, Inc. or other systems with built-in auxiliary power for fail safe protection, shall satisfy this requirement.  (Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches).  A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized.  If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of the area concerned. 
	
(c)  End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.
	
	(d)  The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.
	
	
	
	H.4 Information Technology
	
	Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.
	
	When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. Removable storage media must be secured in the safe.
	
	In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.
	
	When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporter’s equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 
	
	Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.
	
	The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 
	
	All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 
	
	Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 
	
	Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	H.5 Disposition
	
	(a)  During the contract performance period, if any removable hard drives or cartridges used in conjunction with this contract become defective, this (these) removable hard drive(s) or cartridge(s) shall be removed and turned over to the Department of Justice for destruction.  The Government will not compensate the Contractor for costs of any defective drives. 
	
	(b)  At the conclusion of the contract period, all media materials used in conjunction with this contract (i.e. floppy disks, removable hard drives or cartridges, cassette/magnetic tape, stenographic and hand-written notes, typewriter ribbons, etc.) shall be turned in to the USAO for destruction.  Any of the media materials, which become defective during the contract performance period, shall be immediately turned in to the Department of Justice for destruction. The Government will not compensate the Contractor for the costs of these media materials.
	
	
	
	H.6 Protection of Grand Jury Information
	
	(a)  Grand Jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, disclosures of matters occurring before the Grand Jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the Grand Jury only when so directed by the court.
	
	(b)  It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to Grand Jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the Grand Jury information be done within the United States Attorney’s office.
	
	(c)  The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a Grand Jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 
	
	H.7 Notice to Proceed 
	
	Within ten (10) calendar days after the contract award, the Government will furnish the Contractor with personnel security application forms.  The Contractor shall complete and return to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative all personnel security application forms within seven (7) calendar days after receipt. After a sufficient number of Contractor Personnel are cleared by the Government, a notice to proceed will be issued the Contracting Officer specifying a performance start date. 
	
	H.8 Contractor Employee Residency Requirement 
	
	All contractor employees assigned to this contract and business within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.
		
	H.9 Prohibition on Use of Non-US Citizens  
	
	The Department of Justice does not permit the use of Non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or development of any DOJ IT system.  By signing the contract or commitment document, or commencing work there under, the contractor agrees to this restriction. [In those instances where other non-IT requirements contained in the contract or commitment can be met by using Non-U.S. citizens, those requirements shall be clearly described]. 
	
	H.10 Consent of Subcontractors
	
	The term subcontractor, as used in this contract, includes any contractor business on behalf of the prime contractor.  Subcontracting is not restricted under this contract if, in the judgment of the government, it does not adversely affect the quality or delivery of the final product or service.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to restrict subcontracting if it is determined that such an action is in the best interest of the Government.  Subcontractors named and described in the Contractor’s successful proposal are considered authorized to perform work under this contract without further written consent from the Contracting Officer, unless such consent is revoked by the Contracting Officer.  If the prime contractor recommends additional subcontractors, the Contracting Officer must provide consent prior to the subcontractor performing any work or having access to any relevant information.
	
	
	H.11 Key Personnel

   A.  The key personnel whom the Contractor shall furnish for the performance of this contract are as follows:
 
  Name	Title

  TO BE DETERMINED AT TIME OF AWARD

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.

(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to— 
(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or 
(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor’s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor’s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. 
(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. 
(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

(E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. 
(iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. 
(i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:

(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the— 
     (1) Quantities being acquired; and 
     (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. 
(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor— 
     (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or 
     (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor’s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. 
(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall— 
     (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and 
     (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. 
(D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. 
     (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert “None” if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ‘None’.”] 
    (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert “$0” if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ‘None’).”] 
(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. 
(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. 
(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): 
(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; 
(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment— 
(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); 
(B) The Contractor’s timekeeping procedures; 
(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and 
(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. 
(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost— 
(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and 
(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. 
(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. (i) Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The contractor’s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and request instructions for disposition of the overpayment. 
(ii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the “completion invoice” and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. 
(6) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. 
(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. 
(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. 
(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. 
(7) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. 
(8) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. 
(9) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. 
(l) Termination for the Government’s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided

An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 
(l) Debriefing. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: 
(1) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer. 
(2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. 
(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. 
(4) A summary of the rationale for award; 
(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. 
(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 
(End of provision) 


L.2	52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items (JAN 1999)

 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Evaluation Criteria

Organizational Experience
Price

Organizational Experience – In determining Organizational experience of the contractor, we will evaluate their Past Performance to determine the degree to which a contractor, as an  organization, has satisfied its customers. The EOUSA will check each contractor’s client reference to inquire about  (1) the quality and timeless of the vendor’s work: (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities. The EOUSA may check references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendor’s submission. The actual number of reference checked is entirely at the EOUSA’s discretion. 

Price – The Government intends to make contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offeror’s total price. If the Government determines that there are significant differences  in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may by selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendor’s price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above.

Best Value Source Selection

Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important that price. EOUSA will not select an offer for award on the basis of superior capability without consideration of  the amount of its price. The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection authority will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offerors.


L.3	52.216-1 Type of Contract (APR 1984)

The Government contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with firm fixed unit prices resulting from this solicitation.  

L.4	52.216-27  Single or Multiple Awards (OCT 1995)
 
   The Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or task order contract or to award multiple delivery order contracts or task order contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.

L.5	52.233-2 Service of Protest (Sep 2006)
(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:
Wolfgang Nickle, EOUSA, 600 E Street, NW, Suite 2400, Washington, DC 20530
(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.
(End of Provision)
	
	
	
	
	
	SECTION M
	EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
	
	M.1 Evaluation Factors
	
The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience and price. Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.
1. Capability of the Offeror

EOUSA will assess (evaluate) the capability of each offeror on the basis of its proposed key personnel, organizational experience, and organizational past performance. EOUSA will use its assessment of capability as a basis for comparing offeror’s to determine best value.

A.	Key Personnel   The Contractor shall provide personnel with the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform the duties as stated in the Scope of Work.  The key personnel shall have experience with recording and transcribing Grand Jury and deposition testimony.

B.	Organizational Past Performance   Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  EOUSA will contact some of the offeror’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, EOUSA will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases. Organizations that do not have a past organizational experience record will receive a “neutral” rating.

C. 	Organizational Experience    EOUSA will evaluate each offeror’s experience on the basis of its breath, its depth, and its relevance to the work as stated in the Scope of Work.  

2.	Price   EOUSA will evaluate the contractor’s proposed prices to determine that the prices 
	are fair and reasonable.
3.	Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors- Best Value Source Selection
Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of superior capability without consideration of the offered price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection authority will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offerors.
4.  	Source Selection Decision
An EOUSA technical evaluation panel will rank offerors from best to worst by making paired comparisons and trading off the marginal differences in capability and price.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the technical evaluation panel will decide whether the marginal difference in capability is worth the marginal difference in price.  If the technical evaluation panel considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

•	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

•	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

•	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

•	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

•	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

•	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

•	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

•	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

•	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


•	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

•	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 





Attachment - J.4



Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Data.

a.    Systems Security
	
The work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of data that originated within the Department, data that the contractor manages or acquires for the Department, and/or data that is acquired in order to perform the contract and concerns Department programs or personnel. 
 
For all systems handling such data, the contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to Department of Justice systems, including but not limited to all Executive Branch system security requirements (e.g., requirements imposed by OMB and NIST), DOJ IT Security Standards, and DOJ Order 2640.2E.  The contractor shall provide DOJ access to and information regarding the contractor’s systems when requested by the Department in connection with its efforts to ensure compliance with all such security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Department in such efforts. DOJ access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by DOJ, FISMA data reviews, and access by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General for its reviews.    

The use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store data covered by this clause is prohibited until the contractor provides a letter to the contracting officer (CO) certifying the following requirements:  

1.  Laptops must employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 approved product;

	2.  The contractor must develop and implement a process to ensure that security 
	and other applications software is kept up-to-date; 

3.  Mobile computing devices will utilize anti-viral software and a host-based 
firewall mechanism.  

4.  The contractor shall log all computer-readable data extracts from databases 
holding sensitive information and verify each extract including sensitive data 
has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required.  All DOJ information 
is sensitive information unless designated as non-sensitive by the Department. 

5.  Contractor-owned removable media, such as removable hard drives, flash 
drives, CDs, and floppy disks, containing DOJ data, shall not be removed from 
DOJ facilities unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product;

6.  When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be 
processed (sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with security 
requirements applicable to DOJ;  
7.  Contracting firms shall keep an accurate inventory of devices used on DOJ 
contracts;

8.  Rules of behavior must be signed by users.  These rules shall address at a 
minimum:  authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; 
and protection of sensitive data and personally identifiable information;

9.  All DOJ data will be removed from contractor-owned laptops upon 
termination of contractor work.  This removal must be accomplished in 
accordance with DOJ IT Security Standard requirements.  Certification of data 
removal will be performed by the contractor’s project manager and a letter 
confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of 
termination of contractor work. 

	b.   Data Security

By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that 
with respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or 
suspected breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized 
disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, 
whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event 
later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the 
contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR).

If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO 
nor the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer 
Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT (1-866-874-
2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach.  The contractor shall also 
notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.  

	c.    Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement

The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains 
procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable 
information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, 
breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall 
not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification 
would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national 
security.  The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be
coordinated with, and be subject to the approval of, the Department.  The 
contractor assumes full responsibility for taking corrective action consistent with 
the Department’s Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include 
offering credit monitoring when appropriate.


	
	d.    Pass-through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors
						
The requirements set forth in Paragraphs a through c, above, apply to all 
subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract.  For each 
subcontractor, the contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor 
to adhere to all such requirements.  Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the 
provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.







                                                                                                          Attachment  J-5

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web
site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested. The Solicitation Number is W912LC-09-T-5002, Request for Quotation. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 252.212-7001, 252.225-7001. This procurement is a Total Set-Aside for Small Business in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334112. The size standard is 1,000 in number of employees. The Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 5045. The Federal Service Code is 7025. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES: The 140th COMM Flight at the Colorado Air National Guard, 18865 E. Breckenridge Ave Bldg 850, Buckley AFB Aurora, CO 80011-9544 is requesting In computer storage, NetApp filer, known also as NetApp Fabric-Attached Storage (FAS), is NetApp's network attached storage (NAS) device. A FAS functions as an enterprise-class Storage area network (SAN) as well as a networked storage appliance. It can serve storage over a network using file-based protocols such as NFS, CIFS, FTP, TFTP, and HTTP. Filers can also serve data over block-based protocols such as Fibre Channel (FC) and iSCSI.<br />NetApp Filers implement their physical storage in large disk arrays. Most other large storage vendors' filers tend to use commodity computers with an operating system such as Microsoft Windows Storage Server or tuned Linux. NetApp filers use highly customized commodity hardware and the proprietary Data ONTAP operating system, both designed specifically for storage-serving purposes. All filers have battery-backed NVRAM, which allows them to commit writes to stable storage quickly, without waiting on disks. Early filers used to connect to external disk enclosures via SCSI, but models as of 2009 use FC protocol. The disk enclosures (shelves) support FC hard disk drives, as well as parallel ATA and serial ATA ones. Implementers often organize two filers in a high-availability cluster with a private high-speed link, either FC or InfiniBand. One can group such clusters together under a single namespace when running the OnTap GX<br />operating system. Please include F.O.B and any freight, installation, or shipping charges. ATTN: Prospective bidders shall submit their bid along with the attached Representations and Certifications by Email to: lia.hudson@cobuck.ang.af.mil or by Mail to: 140MSG/MSC, Air Guard Contracting Office, Bldg 1005, MS#78, 660 S. Aspen St, Buckley AFB, Aurora, CO 80011-9523. The point of contact for technical questions regarding this solicitation can be addressed to: Mark.Waibel@cobuck.ang.af.mil. No phone calls please. The closing date for submission of bids is May 15, 2009 by 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time. Bids shall be evaluated on the basis of Price, Delivery Time and Past Performance.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft will be based out of the Deadhorse area of Alaska to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys, law enforcement and marine sanctuary related research. Due to extreme weather conditions in the Arctic regions and other areas of Alaska, it has been mandated by the NOAA aircraft operations risk management process to require the Twin Otter aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period August 30 through October 20. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities in the harsh environment.</p>
<p>SCOPE: <br />NOAA Twin Otter aircraft will be operating out of Deadhorse, Alaska in support of marine mammal surveys August 30, 2009 thru October 20, 2009 and two option periods thereafter. Some operations will be based in Barrow, Alaska with a weather contingency alternative plan for Deadhorse. This is due to the fact that no hangar is available in Barrow, Alaska. An additional NOAA Twin Otter will also be on the North Slope operating primarily out of Barrow, Alaska. There will be a NOAA Twin Otter mechanic in Deadhorse supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one Twin Otter is required in the hangar at one time. However, if maintenance or equipment installation is required, there may be a request to shift one aircraft out on the ramp to allow another one access.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide hangar space for a DHC-6 Twin Otter having a wing span of 65 feet and 19 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security clause 1352.239-73 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1)Ground support equipment use including:<br />a)DC external power unit,<br />b)Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c)Tow vehicle for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2)Hangar amenities including: tools equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3)24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4)Access to office space to include internet, phone/fax/copier,<br />5)Small storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />6)Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from August 30, 2009 thru October 20, 2009 with options for August 30, 2010 thru October 20, 2010 and August 30, 2011 thru October 20, 2011. The Government may exercise the option 60 days before August 30, 2010 and sixty days before August 30, 2011. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than October 20, 2009, October 20, 2010, and October 20, 2011. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain liability and hull insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The period of performance for this effort will be a base year with two (2) one (1) year option periods. The base year will begin on May 6, 2009 and end on May 5, 2010. The option years will extend from May 6, 2010 until May 5, 2011 and May 6, 2011 until May 5, 2012.

The NRC plans to award the sole source procurement to MIT in order to support Dr. George Apostolakis. Dr. Apostolakis is a Special Government Employee (SGE) assisting the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS). Dr. Apostolakis is based out of Boston, Massachusetts, but as a SGE, is required to frequently travel to Rockville, Maryland in order to fulfill his responsibilities to the NRC. This "off-site" frequent travel situation is unique and requires administrative support with extensive knowledge of the Federal Travel Regulations and access to the NRC system for travel authorizations, vouchers and accommodations. In addition, Dr. Apostolakis's status as a SGE requires specific monitoring of his ACRS activities as prescribed.  The administrative assistant must be intimately familiar with the NRC labor codes and their relationship to the budget. The travel regulations, compensation regulations, and SGE requirements are activities which may be audited and therefore require extensive knowledge to ensure they are properly documented.

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) Initial Governance Response Program (IGRP) assists the Government of Colombia (GOC) to stabilize areas recently retaken from insurgent forces by promoting government presence and responsiveness to local needs. OTI's main government partner is the Center for Coordination of Integrated Action (CCAI by its Spanish acronym), which is part of the Office of the President and is responsible for coordinating the establishment of government services in 12 prioritized parts of the country. All OTI project activities are carried out in the name of Acción Social, the partner organization for CCAI. Through the promotion of Acción Social's presence, the program strengthens the credibility and legitimacy of the GOC in post-conflict areas; increases the willingness and capacity of communities to cooperate and interact with the GOC; and improves the GOC's capacity to respond to community-prioritized necessities, including efforts to increase economic opportunities, in a timely and credible manner.

OBJECTIVE

To hire a qualified individual to serve as a Field Program Manager in support of OTI’s programs in Colombia.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The OTI Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin America & the Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and is based in Bogota, Colombia.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.    

The Field Program Manager’s principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.   

Duties and Responsibilities

The work of the OTI Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Field Program Manager will have the following responsibilities:

•	Assist in the design and deployment of monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms appropriate to the program;

•	Support the OTI Country team on USAID and OTI administrative requirements (budget preparation and tracking, financial management, travel assistance, procurement); 

•	Maintain detailed records/files of program information;

•	Assist in supervising, training and/or mentoring Foreign National PSC (FNPSC) OTI staff; implementing staff, and locally hired teams;

•	Assist in regularly communicating and sharing program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;

•	Design and deployment of monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms appropriate to the program;

•	Supervise periodic baseline surveys, and survey teams, and communicate and present results to a range of audiences in the US Government, local government, and others;

•	Meet and collaborate with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, implementing partners, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others key players who may be interested in OTI activities or have important information related to the start up or ongoing development of OTI activities;

•	Communicate and present lessons learned to audiences such as US government officials, local government officials, other donor officials, and others as required; 

•	Serve as Acting OTI Country Representative as required;

•	Take the lead in developing an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs.

•	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-12 and GS-13 positions carefully.

	NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged, 	but submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a 	complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the 		OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to 	provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being 	considered for employment.

All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.

2.	A supplemental document specifically addressing: 
	Each of the Education/Experience requirements shown in the solicitation.
	Each of the six (6) Evaluation Factors shown in the solicitation.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

See below diagram for approximate power/network drop locations.  Existing ceiling is approximately 8 ft suspended utilizing 2ft x 4 ft drop in tiles.  Existing structural beams do exist in the perimeter walls and have potential to impact configuration and installation.  Note: All, final measurements shall be verified by awarded contractor prior wall installation.  <BR><BR><BR>2.0 BACKGROUND<BR><BR>2.1 The contractor will determine suitable partition wall materials for this project in accordance with this SOW.  The partitions must have the following options: multiple segmented, sound damping, raceway panel configurations, with options of multiple complementary fabrics, wood laminates, vented, or whiteboard surfaces, partitions must make complete, floor to ceiling private office spaces with locking full width doors, and reception stations.  All connections are integral to the extruded aluminum frame.  Universal connector posts work for all same- and multi-height connections, to allow for reconfiguration of partitions. Less than ceiling height panel-to-panel locking plates are covered with curved top caps. All trim is painted metal to ensure color matching. The contractor will be responsible for the installation of the partitions, system, wiring and necessary components in accordance with industry standards.  Floor diagram drawings will be provided at the site visit.  It will be the responsibility of the winning contractor to ensure all measurements are accomplished prior to installation.  If the walls do not fit once at the site, the contractor will take full responsibility to ensure the walls fit accordingly. <BR><BR>2.2 The following requirements are deemed necessary for the purchase and installation of the system:   <BR><BR>- Partitions will have as a minimum the following characteristics:<BR>-- sound damping<BR>-- locking full width doors<BR>-- demountable / reconfigurable<BR>-- raceway panel configurations<BR>-- fabrics complementary to the existing wall color (white)<BR>--- cherry wood laminates or other similar dark woods<BR>--- vented<BR>--- may have optional tackable surfaces, whiteboard surfaces, etc.<BR>-- Installed from floor to ceiling in a secure manner but not a permanent installation<BR>- Minimum requirement for power/network drop is for an allowance only (i.e one power and one network single-gang box per location  as approximately indicated by the below diagram and requisite allowance to route appropriate wiring from the floor to the network/power box)<BR>-- See below diagram for approximate power/network drop locations.  <BR>- Wall color scheme to follow existing walls in the area.<BR>- Walls need to be appropriate to an office environment. <BR>- Door hardware will accept Best Lock cores to conform with the established base lock and key plan (figure 8 style).  <BR>- Installation to occur on or around 4 May 2009<BR><BR>2.3 See attached diagram for approximate location for wall installation.  The attached drawing is not to any scale.  Field measurements are required for wall positioning as well as height.<BR><BR>The partitions will need to be located to ensure they do not conflict with ceiling diffusers (each room needs a supply and return air vent), lights, motion detectors, windows, or sprinkler heads.<BR><BR>At the perimeter walls on the north side of the building, there is a light soffit, structural beam, and cross bracing that obstructs a smooth connection between the partition and the wall.  The partition installation will need to address this irregularity.  <BR><BR>2.4 Documentation. The contractor shall provide the operation and maintenance documentation for the partitions after completion of the project in both paper and searchable electronic format. Contractor will also provide As Installed  drawings at the time of project completion.<BR><BR>2.5 Integration. The contractor shall perform all acceptance testing of the partitions to ensure operational capability in all areas.<BR><BR>2.6 Contractor personnel will require installation passes due to project being accomplished in a DOD environment. The contractor may provide required documentation to Camp Murray security in order to obtain base passes.<BR><BR>2.7 Period of Performance  The project is required to be completed within 60 calendar days after contract award (this will include the manufacturing, delivery and installation).  If the contractor cannot meet the required deadline, bid shall be considered non-responsive. <BR><BR>3.0 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT<BR><BR>3.1 Warranty. The contractor shall provide the required commercial warranty for a minimum of one year after installation of equipment.<BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the responses to questions received by the deadline of 12Noon EST on 14 April 2009. These reponses as well as the appropriate documents are included as attachments.

1. QUESTION: Should the Contractor be already trained on how to repair the engines or will the Coast Guard provide training?

ANSWER: The technicians must be qualified/certified on the Honda 150/225 HP 4-stroke outboards. The Coast Guard will not provide this training.  They need this skill set as a pre-requisite.

2. QUESTION: What is the class training schedule for the boats?  

ANSWER: See the attached document titled “Class Training Schedule”

3. QUESTION: Performance Work Statement Paragraph 3.0: 
During the site visit it was noted by the coast guard that all material including consumables will be provided by the government.  If the contractor is required to procure material, will it be compensated?

ANSWER: The Coast Guard will provide all material including consumables. The contractor will not make any purchases. All purchases will be performed by the Coast Guard storekeepers.  

4. QUESTION: Will the contractor be responsible to pull the boats at the ramp & will the contractor have to provide the vehicle to pull the boats?

ANSWER: The boat/truck/trailer will be delivered to the boat ramp by a Coast Guard crew.  The Coast Guard will always provide the vehicle to launch and recover these platforms. The transit of boat and vehicle will be the responsibility of the Coast Guard.  Contractors will be wrench turners not drivers.

5. QUESTION: For purpose of determining the weekly man hour requirements for Planned Maintenance, how many hours are the RB’s and TANB’s operated per week?

ANSWER: See the response for Question 2.  

6. QUESTION: Is there historical data for non-maintenance related failures (ie. water impellers, propellers, belts, lower units, etc.) of equipment?

ANSWER: Yes, this info is captured in the boat records. These records are not available to the public. This will be provided after award to the winning Contractor upon request.

7. QUESTION: A Maintenance Requirement List for the TANB has been provided in the solicitation, can the government provide a Maintenance Requirement List for the RB’s?

ANSWER: See attached document titled “MRL for RB-S”

8. QUESTION: Can you provide the yearly training schedule for scheduling purposes?

ANSWER: See the response for Question 2.  

9. QUESTION: What is the inventory of standard repair parts for the RB and TANB vessels?

ANSWER: This is not a concern for the contractors. The Coast Guard is responsible for inventory.

10. QUESTION: Yesterday we were told that the USCG would provide trucks for moving the boats. The PWS says that the contractor is to provide transportation (less trailers) for work on boats away from Yorktown. Can you clarify?

ANSWER: The contractor will not need to provide transportation when moving boats. The Coast Guard will move all boats.

11. QUESTION: Are Honda certified technicians required?  If so, to what level?

ANSWER: Yes, they must have attended a Honda Certified School.  We are not looking for master technicians with numerous advanced certificates.  They must have hands on experience on the Honda engines.

12. QUESTION: Are Safe Boat certified technicians required?  If so, to what level?

ANSWER: No

13. QUESTION: Are the boats in the contract being run on ethanol blended fuel?

ANSWER: Yes, all boats throughout the entire Coast Guard are being run on ethanol blended fuel.

14. QUESTION: I was wondering if the contractor is expected to conduct the daily checks (D-1-A), and the weekly PMS items.

ANSWER: Yes, daily’s and weekly’s will be performed. This can be a joint effort by contractors and boat crews.

15. QUESTION: Also the "Response Boat-Small Technical Manual 081, Safe Boats" does not seem to match the CEIUM TB-0000-001"Maintenance Requirements Last". I assume that we should be concentrating on the 081 Safe Boat Manual for the sake of biding the maintenance time for the Safe Boats. I understand that the PMS information will be posted for the TANB's.

ANSWER: The Coast Guard will perform work as indicated by the PMS Manual.  There will be times when updates and bulletins will also apply to the upkeep of these boats.   Any questions will be clarified by the Coast Guard Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR). The PMS info for the TANB should have been provided already.

16. QUESTION: Are these new RIB boats?

ANSWER: These are RB-S boats.  Response Boat Small.  A RIB is a Rigid Inflatable Boat, these boats are not inflatable. The collars are foam sprayed with rhino liner.

17. QUESTION: How many hours per year do you anticipate on each RIB

ANSWER: See the attached document titled “Class Training Schedule”

18. QUESTION: How many hours per year do you anticipate on each TANB

ANSWER: See the attached document titled “Class Training Schedule”

19. QUESTION: Daily & Weekly checks, will these be preformed by the Contractor or by the boat crews?

ANSWER: See the response for Question 14.  

20. QUESTION: Honda recommended service after each use – excluded?

ANSWER: At the end of the day the boats will be secured and cleaned and made ready for the next day’s operations/training evolutions.

21. QUESTION: The contractor requests a minimum of one, preferably two years of past maintenance records for all boats listed in the RFP.

ANSWER: Will be provided after award to the winning Offeror upon request.

22. QUESTION: Page 5 of the PWS section 8.0 states” The contract includes a Performance Requirements Summary”, please explain the incentive plan when the contractor meets performance standard.

ANSWER: See Table 8.1 for incentives

23. QUESTION: In the event the contractor is required to work overtime, who is the approving authority?

ANSWER: There will be no overtime under this contract. All hours expended under the resulting contract will be from the billable hours proposed.
24. QUESTION: Since this is a T&M Contract, will the estimated total hours be used for the ceiling?  Will the ceiling be increased due to unforeseen conditions or circumstances?
ANSWER: The total proposed amount will be used as the ceiling. The Government does not intend to increase the ceiling amount and any request to do so may not be granted.
25. QUESTION: I think the discussion yesterday regarding working overtime and having 8 boats in B-0 status. For when a class is onboard should be clarified better. If the CG needs boats always ready it should be stated.

ANSWER: There will be no overtime under this contract. All hours expended under the resulting contract will be from the billable hours proposed. The number of boats that need to be operational at a given time is identified in Table 8.1 under Section 8 of the Performance Work Statement.
26. QUESTION: Can you provide a copy of the Tag out instruction COMDTINST 9077.1C?

ANSWER: Will be provided after award to the winning Offeror upon request.

ANSWER: No

28. QUESTION: Paragraph 5.1 – How many deliveries anticipated?

ANSWER: Cannot determine at this time.

29. QUESTION: How is “Local commuting area” determined?

ANSWER: "Local commuting area" means the area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and reasonably can be expected to travel back and forth daily in their usual employment.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><p>Note: For the purposes of this RFI, "development system" is defined as an effort which results in a demonstrated capability as outlined in the draft Statement of Objective (SOO). The effort may or may not leverage existing technology and will be at the potential contractors' discretion. The Government does not anticipate a traditional large- scale research and development effort will be necessary to demonstrate the needed capability. This RFI, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), is intended to identify potential sources for a Control &amp; Reporting Center (CRC) Ground Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) development system in support of Global Hawk Block 40 Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E). The CRC Ground BMC2 development system will be capable of receiving, processing, and displaying Global Hawk Block 40 MP-RTIP sensor data, in addition to other intelligence data and tactical information. Initial market research reveals there are existing products that may be leveraged to substantially meet required capabilities such as: ground tracking; ground situational awareness utilizing GMTI, SAR, Electronic Protection (EP), multi-INT data and Link 16 messages; history playback; and area sentinel monitoring. Besides these core capabilities, the system must support a visual collaborative environment between geographically dispersed users utilizing the CRC'! s organic networks and communication systems. Visual collaboration is expected to facilitate virtual operator coordination on ground tracks, sensor tasking, and target identification. The development system will leverage the CRC's Link 16 track management capability to transmit locally generated tracks over Link 16 in accordance with MIL-STD-6016D. The Government anticipates but is not obliged to release a solicitation for the above effort in FY2009. A system development (see definition, next paragraph) effort of approximately 10 months is anticipated, but a longer schedule may be tolerated. In order to be considered for this effort, a potential contractor must have familiarity with ground target tracking, situation awareness displays, visual collaboration techniques and MIL-STD-6016D Link-16 message processing. The objective of this RFI is to identify any interested and qualified sources capable of satisfying the draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD) requirements provided. Interested parties who meet the above criteria should describe their up-to-date products, services, experience, and technical capability relevant to successfully accomplishing this effort. Additionally, though not obligated, the Government requests a rough order of magnitude estimate of contracted costs to satisfy the SOO and TRD requirements, along with a top level schedule and staffing profile for system development and support to GH Blk 40 DT&amp;E and IOT&amp;E. Comments regarding any of the documents in the RFI package are welcomed. Although not required, please limit your response to 10 pages single space minimum of 12 point font. Please supply this information either by FAX, mail, or e-mail not later than 20 Apr 2009 to Capt. Andrew Geisel, Contracts Manager, 781-377-4755, FAX # 781-377-4924, Andrew.Geisel@hanscom.af.mil, building 1630, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 Please indicate if you are US or foreign-owned and if you are a large or small business. The Government will evaluate all responses objectively however a determination not to compete this effort, based upon responses received, will remain the sole discretion of the Government. PLEASE REFER TO THE CONTENTS OVERVIEW FILE BEFORE READING ANY OTHER ATTACHMENTS. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL SOLICITATION. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SUBMITTED.</p>

<p>All attachments have been removed and will be&nbsp;available at a later date. We will continue to provide answers to any possed questions to the best of our ability. A closing a date will be established once the documentation becomes releasable.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.  
The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure.  Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide.  Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out.  The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise.  The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform.  In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism.

In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program.  The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012.  Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract.  In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).  
In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs.  The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.)  
The projected start date is January 2010.  Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas. 

•Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States;

•Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities;

•Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises;

•Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials;
 
•Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives;

•Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance;

•Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs;

•Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms);

•Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems;

•Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure; 

•Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads;

•Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders;

•Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities;

•Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations;

•Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.  Establish and verify schedules and performance of transport services as well as establish and maintain key relationships associated with movement of WMD;

•Provide Subject Matter Experts with expertise in the transportation infrastructure of CTR partner countries capable of detailed investigation into tariffs, regulations, certifications, ad hoc support requests or to attend project meetings between government agencies relating to the movement of weapons of WMD and/or associated components;

•Provide ability to establish and manage contract(s) with transportation vehicle maintenance facilitie(s) to conduct and verify maintenance as required to maintain applicable certifications relating to WMD transport vehicles and;

•If authorized, apply CTR resources to the elimination of conventional arms, munitions and their associated infrastructure.

Contractors who believe that they posses the expertise and experience to fulfill all of these requirements and their complex systems engineering activities are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing each of these areas in writing.  Interested contractors should also address whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules.  Please send responses via e-mail to CTRC_INFO@dtra.mil by close of business on 12 March 09.  Please limit your response to no more than five pages (size: 8.5”x 11” pages, with 1” margins), using Times New Roman 12 pt font or equivalent, and submitted in Microsoft Word 2003 or Adobe PDF formats.  Also include information such as: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and whether your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. (4) Is your firm a certified HUBZone firm (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. All information received in this RFI that is marked “Proprietary” will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

Industry Day tenatively scheduled for March 24, 2009, has been postoned until further notice due to scheduling conflicts. DTRA would like to make Industry Day as successful and as beneficial as possible to our industry partners. This delay will enable DTRA to provide more specific requirement details regarding the Cooperative Threat Reduction Integration Contract (CTRIC) recompete. This is only a scheduling delay. DTRA anticipates moving further with this acquisition in the near future.

The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions.

The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-, Unusual and compelling urgency.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis.  GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>

<DESC>GSA is encouraged by the level of interest in 8(a) STARS II. Many 8(a) organizations requested that the Contracting Officer allow additional time to better prepare for the coming solicitation, which was anticipated to be released mid-April 2009. GSA is amenable to providing additional time as it helps promote competition, so it is now planning to release the solicitation May 2009.  This does not impact the intention to have offers due before summer 2009.

A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm. How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR § 121.104 and 13 CFR § 121.106, respectively. SBA also includes the table of size standards in the Small Business Size Regulations, 13 CFR 121.201. This table includes size standards that have changed since the last publication of 13 CFR 121. For more information on these size standards, please visit http://www.sba.gov/size. If you have any other questions concerning size standards, contact a Size Specialist at your nearest SBA Government Contracting Area Office, or contact the Office of Size Standards by email at sizestandards@sba.gov or by phone at (202) 205-6618.
Status as a qualified HUBZone small business concern is determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in accordance with 13 CFR Part 126. If the SBA determines that a concern is a qualified HUBZone small business concern, it will issue a certification to that effect and will add the concern to the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns on its Internet website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. A firm on the list is eligible for HUBZone program preferences without regard to the place of performance. The concern must appear on the list to be a HUBZone small business concern.

<DESC>The U.S Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors for the restoration of Nashawannuck Pond located in the City of Easthampton, Massachusetts.  Nashawannuck Pond is a man-made impoundment at the confluence of Broad and White Brooks within the Connecticut River Basin. The pond has an area of 31 acres.  The project purpose is to restore aquatic habitat that has been degraded by sedimentation. The project would remove approximately 55,000 cubic yards (CY) of fine-grained sediment from Nashawannuck Pond.   Portions of the pond would be dredged to a depth of 12 feet and other portions would be dredged to a depth of 6 feet. The recommended method for sediment removal at Nashawannuck Pond is to completely drain the pond by lowering the bascule gate at the spillway, then open one or more of the sluice gates at the side of the dam.  Construction access is limited.  There is one access point into the pond and one access point at the disposal area.  After the pond is dewatered, mechanical excavation of the exposed sediments will be undertaken.  The sediments will be loaded onto trucks and hauled to a city owned upland (non-wetland) disposal area located approximately 1-1/8 miles (mi) to the southwest.  Existing flows from both Broad and White Brooks will be diverted away from the sediments to be excavated by excavating a central channel through the pond prior to complete drawdown and using silt fencing to control turbidity.  In addition, a temporary weir will be installed at the upstream side of the culvert connecting Nashawannuck Pond to Rubber Thread Pond under Williston Avenue.  The temporary weir will maintain the surface elevation of Rubber Thread Pond during the excavation activities.  During construction the sluice gates will be adjusted to continually discharge a minimum outflow equal to the inflow of the three tributaries. At the completion of the excavation, the sluice gates will be partially closed in order to maintain downstream flow and allow the pond to refill.  It is anticipated that the refilling of the pond will take approximately three months.  Excavation must be completed by 30 November 2009.  The cost range of the project is between $1 million and $5 million.<BR><BR>The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a size standard of $33.5 million. The solicitation will be issued as a 100% HUBZone set-aside. The estimated issue date for the solicitation is on or about 6 May 2009. Interested bidders can download the solicitation via the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The due date for the bid and specific requirements will be stated in the solicitation package. Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, fax, or email will not be honored. Additional instructions for bid submission will also be provided in the solicitation. All responsible (HUBZone) sources may submit a bid for consideration.<BR><BR>

<AWARDEE>Technology Security Associates, Inc., 46915 S SHANGRI-LA DR, LEXINGTON PARK, MD 20653-1099 US
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has awarded a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, consisting of a base year and four option years, to Technology Security Associates, Inc. (TSA) for management and technical support services.  Per FAR 16.301-2, cost-reimbursement types of contracts are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.  A CPFF type contract was appropriate as the associated tasking is dynamic, which makes it difficult to estimate labor mix and hours with confidence.   Cost-reimbursement contracts may be used only when (FAR 16.301-3(a)(1)) the contractor’s accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract; and (FAR 16.301-3(a)(2)) appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used.  TSA’s accounting system was deemed adequate via Audit Report Number 6701-2006M17740002, dated 21 November 2005 from DCAA Baltimore.  In order to ensure appropriate Government surveillance, a Contracting Officer’s representative (COR) was appointed to review all required technical/financial data submissions and provide daily oversight of contractor efforts.  In addition, a performance based statement of work and a quality assurance surveillance plan, including performance metrics, were incorporated into the contract.  The contract was awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition of Title 10 USC 2304 (c)(4), as implemented by FAR 6.302-4, “Full and open competition need not be provided for when precluded by the terms of an international agreement or a treaty between the United States and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the acquisition of the supplies or services of such government.” As stated in their Letters of Offer and Acceptance, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom desire to jointly procure contractor support for their respective national programs from TSA. This acquisition satisfies agency requirements as they relate to management, engineering, and technical support efforts critical to the AV-8B Harrier Joint Program Office (JPO) International Program.  All inquiries should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Daniel Chambers, via e-mail at Daniel.Chambers@navy.mil or via telephone at 301-757-7104.

Oracle does not allow any reseller to provide the support services for its Hyperion SQR for Oracle licensing.  A reseller may coordinate the purchase of support, but will never actually provide the support.  Oracle does not discount their support services to resellers; therefore, a reseller will either charge the same price or a higher price for the support.

Due to the fact that Oracle is the only authorized provider of the services and that no reseller discount is available, Oracle is the least cost provider of these support services to the government.

<ARCHDATE>06012009
<DESC>This requirement is for the continuation of contract TIRNO-04-C-00028 for a two-month period as a bridge until a new competitive contract can be awarded. The extension to the contract is required in order to prevent a disruption in services. Having an on-board janitorial contractor is critical in ensuring that the buildings are kept in a clean and sanitary condition. Without the extension of services, there would be a lapse in service, and unclean / unhealthy conditions could lead to possible injury or spread of contagins resulting in illness or death.
