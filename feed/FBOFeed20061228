<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Oracle Federal Financial System (OFF) support for the National Business Center (NBC) Advisory Multi-Step Process. This synopsis is issued by GovWorks under the franchise fund authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) on behalf of the Department of Interior, Office of the Secretary, NBC.  GovWorks intends to award a competitive small business set-aside, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for one or more industry partner(s) to assist in providing integration support to current and potential customers of the Oracle Federal Financial accounting system and supporting Oracle enterprise applications and other third party systems.  Individual task orders will be issued as competitive, Firm Fixed Price task orders.  Of specific note, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, Dec 1996 applies to this solicitation; at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. To be successful, the vendor must be able to demonstrate its ability and capabilities to support simultaneous implementations of various size agencies at any given time. The NBC is an organization within the Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, and serves as the business arm for the Department providing administrative and financial systems and/or services to DOI bureaus and other Federal agencies.   The Government anticipates that the majority of this effort may be performed under NAICS code 541512 Computer Systems Design Services and/or 541519 Other Computer Related Services.  However, in order to provide a total solution to complete all the requirements, other appropriate NAICS codes may apply. The Solicitation/Request for Capability Statement number is 1406-04-07-RC-66969.   All documents applicable to this pre-solicitation notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/Solic/openmarket.asp.   Entire pre-solicitation notice with additional details, Past Performance Template, Attachment 1; Oracle Staff / Resources Vendor Competencies Matrix Template,  Attachment 2.  A list of potential 8(a) teaming partners is also provided at the request of the Small Business Administration, Attachment 3. 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program Participants are strongly encouraged to submit offers. Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.   Please ensure the Request for Capability Statement (RFC) number 66969 and program title (Oracle Federal Financial System Support for the National Business Center) is referenced on all correspondence.   Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.   ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS:  This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.   Phase 1 consists of the submission of the Vendor Capability Statement, agency evaluation of the capability statement, and subsequent advisory notification to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.   Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), proposal evaluation, and competitive range determination, oral presentations and award.  This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit a detailed technical and price proposal, management plan, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify two SAMPLE task scenarios to be priced.  To ensure that the Government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors who are most highly rated and are in the competitive range will be provided an opportunity to participate in oral presentations.   PHASE 1:  SUBMISSION OF VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT, GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION   This phase includes submission of the Vendor Capability Statement followed by Government evaluation and advisory notification.  The program Background and Sample Support Activities are included below for the purpose of providing background information required to participate in this acquisition.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1.  The capability statement Evaluation Criteria are included in this announcement. A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statement: Interested vendors are invited to submit a Capability Statement describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements must be submitted via email to Michael.Farrell2@mms.gov and shanda.georg@mms.gov no later than 2:00 PM, EST February 2, 2007.   Responding to this requirement which seeks contractor-developed solutions, requires a significant effort on the part of the contractor to propose to the Government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the Government's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the Government?s intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this contract award are asked to carefully review the attached Program Background, Sample Support Activities, and Capability Statement Evaluation Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to whether your organization has the experience and capacity to compete. B.  Government Evaluations: The Vendor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions and Evaluation Criteria section.  The Government will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.   C.  Advisory Notifications: GovWorks will issue an advisory notification stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process, ?The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.? PHASE 1 - VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS  The Government only expects a capability statement from qualified prime contractors.

Future customers may include large agencies as well.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate its ability and capabilities to support simultaneous implementations of various size agencies at any given time. NBC BACKGROUND The National Business Center (NBC) is an organization within the Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of the Secretary, and serves as the business arm for the Department in providing administrative and financial systems and/or services to DOI bureaus.  In 1999, DOI established the NBC to provide general administrative and financial services and systems across the Department and to other Federal agencies on a ?service-for-fee? basis.  The NBC has an ongoing need for industry partners to assist in providing implementation and integrator support to current and potential customers of the Oracle Federal Financial accounting system and supporting Oracle enterprise and third party applications.  The NBC currently supports small (less than 1,000 employees) and medium (1,000 to 5,000 employees) Federal agencies with the Oracle accounting system and integrated support systems.  Future customers include large agencies as well.   The future number, size, and nature of the NBC?s Oracle customers will directly depend on the NBC?s and its supporting contractor?s ability to offer competitive Best Value solutions as a Shared Services Provider (SSP) of the Federal-wide Financial Management Line of Business. The NBC is seeking a contractor with significant qualifications to assist the NBC in three (3) areas with regard to Oracle systems implementation, operations, and maintenance: (1) Implementation Proposal Preparation and Execution (2) Support for NBC Implementation Activities  (3) Support for Oracle Applications Operations and Maintenance To be successful, the vendor must be able to demonstrate its ability and capabilities to support simultaneous implementations of various size agencies at any given time.

The selected contractor(s) shall assist the Government in developing implementation price proposals to potential customers and shall serve as the implementation integrator where the Government is selected as the service provider by the customer.   SAMPLE SUPPORT ACTIVITIES General Information: The Government encourages teaming arrangements with other vendors to ensure that there are no instances where the Contractor?s resources are unable to satisfy any or all requirements and timeframes.   The NBC currently supports small (less than 1,000 employees) and medium (1,000 to 5,000 employees) Federal agencies with the Oracle accounting system and integrated support systems.  Future customers include large agencies as well.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate it?s ability and capabilities to support simultaneous implementations of various size agencies at any given time. 1.

The Contractor shall take the lead in developing the technical approach and obtaining Government input and approval.  The technical proposal shall identify the Contractor as the integrator for performance of the implementation services, with the Government acting as project manager responsible for overseeing the agency implementation.

<SUBJECT>A -- Hemispheric Array Detector for Imaging (HARDI)
<SOLNBR>BAA06-48
<RESPDATE>021207
<ARCHDATE>12282007
<CONTACT>Devanand Shenoy, Program Manager, DARPA/MTO, Phone (571) 218-4932, Fax (703) 696-2206, Email Devanand.Shenoy@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop Hemispherical Array Detectors for Imaging (HARDI) in the VIS-NIR-SWIR (400-1900 nm) spectral region.  The ultimate vision for the program is to demonstrate a focal plane array integrated on a hemispherical surface that will enable high-performance imagers with a small form factor and field of view that far exceeds the state of the art possible with planar focal plane arrays.  The program??s end objectives are to demonstrate a focal plane array prototype that achieves a D-star greater than 10E13 cm-sqrt(Hz)/W over a wide spectral range, a 1 cm radius of curvature with million pixels, a large 120 degree FOV, and a 60 Hz frame rate.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in organic and/or inorganic material systems with inexpensive, easily scalable processing methods.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

The objective of the HARDI program is to exploit the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of both organic and inorganic semiconductor materials along with innovative processing methods to create compact, light-weight detection systems.  The program goal is to develop new photo-detectors that will allow the use of fewer optical elements and eliminate the need for image post processing since the hemispherical planar array will inherently correct for spherical and other optical aberrations.  The challenge to be addressed in this program is to achieve high photo-detector performance over a wide 400-1900 nm spectral band on a curved surface.  Whereas, curved focal planes have been previously demonstrated with a radius of curvature ?? 5 meters, this program seeks to develop curved focal planes with a radius of curvature down to 1 cm.  The detectivity of such a curved focal plane array must be comparable to the performance of inorganic semiconductor planar arrays currently demonstrated in the NIR spectral region (using detectivity, D*, as the relevant metric. This figure of merit was chosen because it is a normalized metric that is independent of unit area and bandwidth) with FOV that far exceed those of current systems.  A FOV greater than 90?? will allow for a simple optical design, which will in turn reduce the weight of the system.  The improved functionality is very beneficial to many military applications by replacing the need for multiple detectors or gimbals thus lessening the mechanical and optical complexity of the system normally required to achieve a wide field of view.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

I.  Technical Area One:  Develop organic materials and processes required to fabricate a curved focal plane array consisting of photo-responsive materials that operate efficiently in the 400-1900 nm spectral range.  These materials may be organic or organic/inorganic composites.  In addition, research and development efforts will include novel materials and device processing technologies necessary to create a small form factor, hemispherical array with more stringent features.

II.  Technical Area Two:  Develop inorganic materials and processes required to fabricate a hemispherical focal plane array. The research and development in this area will exploit the performance of existing photo-responsive materials in the 400-1900 nm spectral range.  Further, new technologies will be required to process inorganic semiconductor materials onto a hemispherical surface with the necessary performance parameters to achieve the end program goals.  These materials could be amorphous inorganics that can be deposited and patterned on a hemispherical surface or alternately, inorganic structures prepared on a planar substrate and then transferred to a non-planar surface.

For both technical areas, a prototype with the following metrics will need to be developed:  
(1) D-star (cm-sqrt(Hz)/W): greater than 10E13 , (2) Array size: million pixels, (3) Radius of curvature:  1 cm, (4) Fill factor:  80 percent, (5) Frame rate: 60 Hz, (6) Dynamic range: 60 dB, (7) Operability: 99 percent, (8) MTBF greater than 5000 h.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-48 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Devanand Shenoy, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: Devanand.Shenoy@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to issue a sole source modification to AT&T Communications, Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by AT&T under contract DCA200-97-D-0054 that was competitively awarded in February 1997.  This modification will: 1) extend the period of performance of the contract from 28 February 2007 to 31 August 2007, and 2) increase the ceiling dollar amount by $17 million, from $125 million to $142 million.  The DISN Video Services-Global (DVS-G) system is in the process of being replaced by DISN Video Services-II (DVS-II).  This modification will provide the continuation of current work and the transitioning of current customers to the new system when DVS-II becomes operational (anticipated in Feb 2007).  AT&T owns and operates all the equipment and proprietary software for the existing DISN Video Services under the DVS-G contract.  The Network Operations Center is located in an AT&T facility in Dranesville, VA.  The government is unable to turn operations over to another vendor since AT&T owns the equipment.  AT&T is the only vendor to incorporate both dial-up and dedicated Video Teleconference Facilities (VTFs) and provides classified support at the level of security required in the timeframe available.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DoD cannot afford any disruption of DVS-G services.  AT&T provides this secure service at a reliability of 99.6% on dedicated transmission links.  The above contract actions will be awarded sole source to AT&T based on their unique ability and capability to maintain the current video teleconferencing (VTC) services system. All delivery orders processed under the DVS-G contract are, and will continue to be, non-synopsized, sole source orders per the original fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Numbered Note 22. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Patricia E. Hilton, Contract Officer, at Patricia.Hilton@disa.mil, or Stephen J. Lemon, Contract Specialist, Stephen.Lemon@disa.mil, no later than 10 February 2007.  (NAICS) 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.                                             Document URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Agency and contracting activity (FAR 6.303 2(a)(1))

a.	The requesting agency is the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Offutt AFB, NE
b.	The contracting activity is 55 CONS/LGCB, Offutt AFB, NE.
c.     The sole source is The Asheville YMCA.

 
2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved (FAR 6.303 2(a)(2))
	
	a.  This requirement is for the acquisition of 76 gym memberships for Air Force members of the Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC).  These memberships are required because no other supplies or services will satisfy unit requirements.

b.  This is a new contract action contemplated to be a Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order using FY07 funds.  No options are being purchased.

c.  The estimated delivery date is 3 January 2007.

3.	Supplies or services required to meet the Agency needs (including estimated value) (FAR 6.303 2(a)(3))

Requirement is to purchase 76 gym memberships to perform physical training as a group, adequate shower facilities, parking, and distance within three miles (or approximately five minutes drive from Veach-Baley Federal Building).  Member must be able to perform a 60-minute workout, shower and return to work (no more than 90 minutes total with commute to/from facility) in accordance with AFI 10-248 and AFWA Supplement 1.

4.	Statutory authority (FAR 6.303 2(a)(4))

10 U. S. C. 2304(c) as stated in FAR 6.302-1(c) ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?

5.	The proposed contractor's unique qualifications require use of the authority cited above (FAR 6.303 2(a)(5))

The Asheville YMCA is .63 miles (three-minute drive from the workplace) and has adequate equipment and parking, as well as a swimming pool.  Capital Fitness is only 1.3 miles from the workplace, but does not have sufficient facilities to accommodate a group of this size.  Asheville Racquet Club is located over five miles away.  Consequently, the Asheville YMCA is the only fitness center with sufficient size, equipment and proximity to the workplace to satisfy the requirement.  No other facility can accommodate unit fitness requirement per AFI 10-248 and AFWA Supplement 1.  

6.	Description of efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable (FAR 6.303 2(a)(6))

See attached.

7.	Determination of fair and reasonable cost (FAR 6.303 2(a)(7))

A separate determination of price fair and reasonable will be made at time of award based on market research of the prices similar in the industry and a comparison of the prices paid on previous acquisitions that have been deemed fair and reasonable.

8. Market survey (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8)

We revalidated the market survey that was accomplished in late Summer/Fall 05.  No new facilities have been reconstructed in the area to accommodate our requirement.

9. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)

Unit has 76 military who must by AFI 10-248 conduct weekly PT to meet AF standards.  Group PT is essential to continue success of this Commander directed program.  Lack of suitable facilities would result in degraded performance and ability to prepare for Air Expeditionary (AEF) requirements.

10.  List of sources, if any, that expressed a written interest in the acquisition (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).

Capital Fitness/Spa Health Club
Asheville Raquet Club

11. Actions, if any, that are being taken to remove and overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)

If future acquisitions are needed for this requirement, extensive market research will be accomplished to determine if other sites are available which will be practical to use for the time constraints that are established.

12.  Contracting Officer certification (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)

I certify, by signature on the cover page, that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

13.  Technical requirements personnel certification (FAR6.303-2(b)

I hereby certify that this justification and approval for other than full and open competition is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully complete this requirement.  I further certify that this requirement is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.

<CONTACT>Kenda C. Tucker Chief of Contracting 7758616417     Kenda_Tucker@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation Number FAQ070021 will be issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the following services: seeding sagebrush and sagebrush/forb mixes on approximately 11,541 acres using Government furnished seed. The Charleston Watershed Aerial Seeding project location is located within Elko County approximately 50 miles northeast of Elko, Nevada. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: General - The Contractor shall seed an estimated 11,541 acres of designated areas in conformance with these specifications and the Detailed Specifications.  Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall furnish at work sites applicator(s) experienced in applying seed in rough, rocky or mountainous terrain, all equipment, labor, supplies, and materials required to complete the job.  The Contractor shall service and repair his/her equipment as necessary to maintain satisfactory progress on work.  Estimated start date is January 22, 2007 and all work will be completed within 45 calendar days. Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) - The Contractor shall be required to utilize a DGPS for electronic Navigation.  System must be capable of utilizing ArcGIS or ARC-INFO shape files created by the government and given to the contractor on a standard HD 1.44 mb, 3.5 inch floppy disk, compact disk or USB compatible flash memory stick. (1) On the ground flaggers and an auto-flagger system can supplement the DGPS system, but not substitute for it. Navigation - DGPS is required for tracking, and data collection. The Contractor shall provide all guidance equipment, materials, computers, printers, personnel, and services required for the system to be used.  The system shall be sufficiently sensitive to provide immediate deviation indications (real-time).  The DGPS system must be capable of determining a differentially corrected location with an error of no more than one to two meters in the horizontal plane.  The guidance system shall be capable of updating current position at a rate of a minimum of one time per second.  Differential correction must cover the complete operational area.  During operation, differentially corrected signal must be accurately recorded at least 90% of the operational time.  Differential correction may be, provided by a portable differential station, FM radio fixed towers, or satellite.  Software provided with DGPS must be designed for parallel offset in increments equal to the assigned swath width of the application equipment.  Base of Operations - The Contractor shall provide such landing facilities as may be required for competent performance of contract. The use of any loading area shall be arranged by and at the discretion and risk of the Contractor, and the Government shall not be held responsible for any loss, mishap, or accident due to conditions of any site used.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate warning signs for traffic if roads are used as loading sites. Equipment - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to satisfactorily seed the designated areas in the time specified as required in the Detailed Specifications.  Equipment shall be capable of traveling at moderate speed and low enough to give proper control and distribution of seed.  This project is limited to rotor wing seeding only.  Fixed wing seeding will not be permitted.  Communication - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to have communications with the Government either by using radio frequencies designated by the Project Inspector or by providing a radio to the Project Inspector. Seed Bucket(s) or Hopper(s) - Sagebrush seed presents unique problems due to its bulkiness and its tendency to bridge in the seed bucket.  In addition, it is anticipated that a majority of the sagebrush seed will have a high moisture content which causes seed to compact, clump, and bridge even more severely.  Therefore, seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include a mechanical agitation system to prevent the seed from bridging in the bucket or hopper.  Equipment that cannot perform the specified work shall be modified or replaced by the Contractor.  Equipment shall be equipped for carrying seed with an approved distribution mechanism complete with release, shutoff, and spreading device, which can be calibrated for spreading seed at the prescribed rate in a satisfactory manner and uniform pattern.  Seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include lids, which fasten securely to prevent seed from blowing out. Seeder Calibration - The Contractor shall calibrate seeding equipment prior to application on the project.  The Government will supply seed for calibration.  However, the seed may not be available until approximately two days prior to the approximate start date of the project.  Seed used for calibration shall be recovered for use on the project. Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the Detailed Specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor. Seeding Operation - Rate of seeding - Seed shall be distributed at the rate stated in the Detailed Specifications, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Some seeding rates may be slightly reduced due to availability of seed.  The following is a list of the locations and quantities for the required seeding: Description/Pounds of Seed/Estimated Acres Desert Unit Mix/55,907/37,271 Mountain Unit Mix High Elevation/2,736/4,275 Mountain Unit Mix Mid Elevation/22,928/8,785 This is a 100% set-aside for small business.  The standard NAICS classification is 115112.  Size standard is $6.5 million.  The Government intends to award this contract on an all-or-none basis. The solicitation will be issued on or about January 2, 2007.  The solicitation may be downloaded from the IDEASEC website:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp. Please print the Standard form (SF)-18 and print all clauses and attachments. Quotes are due January 12, 2007 by 1:00 PM Pacific Standard Time.

(b) must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the !  U.S. for less than two years). (c) will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III). If the background check is selected for verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database. NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO) of the Combat Center. For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  3. Permanent Business Access: Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years. Submit all items listed above under “business access.” NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense. Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor’s expense.  4. Emergency Access: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  5. Installation Access Badges: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation. The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  6. Denial of Access: The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission. In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access. Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract. Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: a. is on the National Terrorist watch List. b. is illegally present in the United States. c. is subject to an outstanding warrant. d. has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent information. e. has been issued a debarment o!  rder and is currently banned from military installations.  7. Employee Identification: Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.  8. Employee Compliance. The Contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.  9. Contract Termination: The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

Description
	This activity will build on successful prior United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assistance developing market value chains in the agricultural sector to include other non-agricultural sectors such as tourism and handicrafts.  Specifically, whereas USAID has successfully supported the development of the Haitian agricultural export industry for a number of years and has  also supported the handicraft sector under a another separate initiative, its support for market value chain development will now be carried out across all sectors where there is the most potential for local, regional and export value-added.  The intent is to gain economies of scale and synergy by combining all value chain analysis and strengthening into a single market-oriented activity.

	The Performance-Based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase the numbers of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities and the income derived there from.   As a result of this activity, USAID expects to see increased incomes, increased trade and investment in selected market chains; increased sustainable livelihood options, and better management of natural resources (particularly soil) by way of increased value of environmentally friendly (non-erosive) products.  The MarChE Project is expected to work in tandem to the maximum extent feasible with other ongoing and planned USAID development activities.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for comprehensive foreign language interpretation, transcription, reporting, and translation services to support various units and troops for SOF operational requirements worldwide.  This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available.     Requests for the same will be disregarded.     THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. 

GENERAL INFORMATION:     Considering recent market research, identified risk factors, previous acquisition history of USSOCOM and its components, and the socio-economic goals of DoD, a solicitation permitting for multiple award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts following the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.504 (b) and (c) is being considered by the Government.  The Government is contemplating that one award be set-aside for a yet to be determined socio?economic class of small businesses and one award allowing for full and open competition.  However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.

The anticipated period of performance would begin on 01 April 2007 and run for a five-year period. Ordering periods would be established in the contract (s) and would run for twelve (12) months each.  The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all ordering periods would be 01 April 2007 to 31 March 2012.
  
Any resulting solicitation will call for Contractor (s) to provide comprehensive foreign language interpretation, transcription, reporting, and translation services to support various units and troops for Special Operations Forces (SOF) operational requirements worldwide.  The actual numbers of linguists, types of languages, and categories of linguists, necessary to meet operational requirements, will be identified by individual task orders.  Potential offerors must be able to provide all labor, equipment, tools, materials, travel, and other items and services necessary to provide foreign language interpretation, transcription, reporting, and translation services to support various units and troops for USSOCOM.  For the purposes of this announcement, USSOCOM includes all personnel in the USSOCOM Headquarters, the Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the U.S. Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs), and any Government agency providing direct support to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission.

Potential Offerors must be able to provide on-site linguists and site managers to support elements in various locations worldwide.  The objective of this contract support is to increase capabilities to meet unforeseen, ongoing, and extremely demanding mission requirements brought about by the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  

Contractor (s) must also have the ability to provide linguists for foreign language translation and interpretation support operations in other areas/countries and exercises/rehearsal events.  Linguists may be required to travel from the Continental United States (CONUS) to the operational area or via travel conveyance arranged and directed by the Government.  

Potential offerors must also be able to provide interview and translation support to USSOCOM.  This support shall include providing linguist support to USSOCOM in the interview and debriefing of sources that are detained/captured and/or persons of interest being questioned.  

Contractor (s) must also be able to provide written conversions of source texts, including but not limited to local periodicals, magazines, foreign government publications, and captured enemy documents from one language into a target language, while keeping the meaning and intent of the original source.  All translation documents shall be word processed in a standard text format and a hard and/or soft copy will be provided to the requiring activity as delineated in individual task orders.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure from Applied Fiber Manufacturing  25 Garrett Drive, Havana, Florida 32309 a Quick Disconnect System.  The Quick Disconnect System safely dissipates recoil produced when releasing 9/16? rope made of high strength Aramid fibers. The Quick Disconnect System needs to be integrated into a high strength potted termination and is required to be lightweight (no more than 2 lbs) and rugged/resistant enough to withstand flight deck shipboard conditions and handling by Naval personnel.  The potted termination must be compatible with a new rope construction consisting of an unjacketed single braid Technora with high pics/inch and a light abrasion resistance coating.  

Applied Fiber Company is considered the only responsible source and has a proprietary potted termination process that guarantees the rated strength of potted terminations to ensure safe operation.  The proprietary process uniquely engages individual fibers for added strength and quality assurance.  It is likely that an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Applied Fiber specializes in the development of applications such as this.  Use of other sources may cause the rated strength of the assembly to vary more than 20% causing potential safety hazard to both personnel and equipment.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Stacy McClain is the point of contact for this notice and can be reached at telephone: (732) 323-4663 and e-mail address: Stacy.McClain@navy.mil. Responses must be received in writing no later than  January 12, 2007 (4 pm EST).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is for the continuation of a current ongoing research project.  T he period of performance is for a base period of 9 months (1 Mar 07  30 Nov 07) and 4 option years.

This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement s.  This notice is not a request for a competitive proposal.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that  competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Needs Assessment for EPA Criteria Pollutant Scientific Literature Database 12/28/06 Amendment 1 to RFQ-OH-07-00033. The purpose of this amendment is to indefinitely extend the due date for receipt of quotations pending an amendment to the solicitation. The Clean Air Act  requires the establishment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the "criteria" air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and lead) and the periodic review of these  standards. One of the primary responsibilities of the National  Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) is to prepare Science Assessments (SA) and Science Assessment Supporting Documents (SASDs) previously known as Air Quality Criteria Documents (AQCDs) for these  criteria air pollutants.  The review of scientific literature is a fundamental component for these activities.  The EPA is considering the development of a continuous process that will identify, compile, characterize and prioritize new scientific studies, which shall include the creation of an  electronic database of information from the studies. Under this order, the EPA seeks to assess the needs of potential users of the literature database and to develop options for database designs that meet these needs. An important factor in the creation of the database is that the database shall  not be simply a method of linking a reference to a published abstract or paper. Input to the database shall be accomplished by individuals knowledgeable in the various scientific disciplines contained in the SA/SASDs  and database references must be categorized into experiments relative to dose,  exposure time, exposure model, endpoint and other parameters. Database queries shall be retrievable in tabular format. Epidemiology analysis and other data references shall be categorized into usable information. This acquisition is designated as a small business set-aside under NAICS code 541710,   size standard of 500 employees and procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested and responsible sources may submit a quotation in response to the RFQ -OH-07-00033, which shall be considered by  the Agency.   The Government will award an order resulting from the RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ, meets  the minimum requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW), delivery and task completion schedule.   The order resulting from this acquisition will be firm-fixed  price.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the RFQ, but will provide electronic copies upon request. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number and email address. All responsible sources may submit a written request to receive the RFQ to Yvonne Harris at   harris.yvonne@epa.gov or by fax at (513) 487-2107. All requests for the RFQ must be received at the office identified above no later than Thursday December 14, 2006. Telephone responses will not be honored.

IN SUPPORT OF THE FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION
 
 
 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of Overseas Buildings Operations, Facilities Management Division is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Build maintenance and repair projects at various Foreign Service Posts worldwide.  The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to licensed firms specializing in building envelope, roofing and waterproofing design-build projects.  Two of the contracts will be set aside for small business.  The small business size standard North American Industry Classification system code is 238160,  $13 million average, based on the annual average gross revenue of a firm which has been in business for three or more years. 
 
Each Contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods. The Government guarantees a minimum of $20,000 in task orders over the life of the Contract.  The maximum dollar value of Task Orders issued under this Contract shall not exceed $3,000,000 per year; the total Contract amount over five years shall not exceed $15,000,000.  Task Orders will be competed between the selected firms. The competitive selection process for individual task orders will be based on a firm fixed price to include all expenses (travel and lodging).  The cost of the Government required Defense Base Act Insurance shall be a direct reimbursable.  The Government reserves the right to make award of individual task orders estimated to be less than $750,000 on a sole source direct negotiation basis under this Contract.
 
Task Orders shall include, but are not limited to, cost and schedule proposals; pre-award on-site investigations; building envelope, roofing and waterproofing contract documentation for design-build to include specifications and calculations; construction and workmanship warranty services; and related requirements for maintenance and repair projects worldwide.  Submissions under this contract shall be compliant with Office of Overseas Buildings Operations guidelines and compatible with Autocad Release 2000.  The work must comply with applicable U.S. and foreign building codes, regulations, and standards.  The anticipated design-build cost of these Task Orders will range from $250,000 to $3,000,000, depending on specific design limitations, locations and security parameters.   Roof replacement and repair work will account for approximately 75-percent of the Task Orders.
 
Professional Design services may include architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, historic preservation, sustainability, curtain wall, roofing, fire, life safety, hazardous material and specification expertise.  Design submission phases will be identified in a design recommendation report and performance specification provided by the Government with each task order and will typically require Design Development (50%) and Final Design (100%).  All submissions shall be sealed and signed by a licensed professional.  Submissions may include product submittals and material procurement for fast-track projects.  Overseas Buildings Operations will review each Design submission and comments will be returned to the design-build firm for incorporation into the Design and Construction.
 
Construction services may include providing all labor, equipment, and materials to execute the design; schedule and cost control; shipping logistics and mobilization; safety planning and implementation; on-site quality control personnel to ensure overall project coordination; overall means and methods throughout the life of the project; acceptance testing; and projects closeout services.  Only U.S. personnel will be allowed to perform specific Construction in specified areas.  Not all Construction will require U.S. personnel therefore the use of foreign labor may be employed for some tasks.  Some building products may be procured from foreign sources. (Reference the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 25, Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Programs).   Labor requirements and a list of materials that don't have to be "U.S. End Source Products" will be identified in each task order.

<RESPDATE>013107
<ARCHDATE>04012007
<CONTACT>Sarah Sims, 309-782-3233
<DESC>Request for Information  Contracting for the Operation and Maintenance of Iowa and Milan Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) PURPOSE: The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, which includes the U.S. Army, PEO Ammunition and Joint Munitions Command, has a continuing requirement for a contractor(s) to operate and maintain the following two Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) facilities: - Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP) located in Middletown, IA, and - Milan Army Ammunition Plant (MLAAP) located in Milan, TN.   We are seeking information that may assist us in the formation of a final acquisition strategy.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is being issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals  (RFP).  This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service.  We reserve the right to accept, reject, or use without obligation or compensation any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. OBJECTIVES: In addition to maintaining various critical capabilities at the facilities, the Government desires to implement an Acquisition Strategy that achieves the following short- and long-term objectives: 1. Provide continuous, effective, safe operation and maintenance of Iowa and Milan AAPs.  2. Create an efficient operation that allows the operating contractor(s) to successfully compete for business in the open market (ammunition or otherwise) without the guarantee of product from the Government.   3. Minimize the total cost to the Army (O&M, product, PBS, modernization) by increasing the efficiency of facility operations. 4. Provide a seamless transition from the current facilities use contract to future facilities use contracts to facilitate the production of conventional ammunition for any/all future requirements. 5. Provide increased transparency into O&M costs and the relative impact on ammunition pricing. 6. Maintain maximum flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. BACKGROUND/GENERAL INFORMATION: American Ordnance LLC (AO) has operated and maintained IAAAP and MLAAP since October 1998 under one, no cost, facilities use contract which will expire 31 Dec 2008.  Benefits to the operating contractor include: - The right to use Government owned assets (property, buildings, equipment) to generate revenue.  - The right to bring in tenants via the ARMS program to generate revenue and help offset the cost of operation. - The Government will provide some initial limited workload, as well as the potential for directed work when justified under a CICA exception. - The Government will fix and/or modernize the Government-owned assets upon receipt, review, approval, and funding of the operating contractors recommendations.  The Government will identify potentially available funds (BRAC, etc). In consideration for the exclusive use of the facilities, the operating contractor complies with the operational plans for base support.  Base support tasks typically include: - Maintenance: Real property and grounds maintenance and management. - Property: Maintenance and management of Government property, to include buildings, structures, roads, bridges, grounds, railroad equipment & facilities, vehicles, equipment, and utility systems. - Security/Force Protection:  Providing a security program for the protection of the people, facility, and its arms, ammunition, and explosives. - Safety: Providing a safety program which protects the lives and health of employees (both Government and contractor), the public, and the facility, including lessees and subcontractors. - Fire Protection: Establish capabilities needed to protect employees and property against fires, hazardous material spills, etc. - Environmental: Ensuring the necessary environmental and hazardous mate rial permits issued in the name of the operating contractor; the Government is responsible for environmental restoration, and the operating contractor is responsible for everything else, such as compliance with Federal and State mandated environmental prog rams and pollution prevention activities. For additional information including draft scopes of work outlining each of the major areas of base support your attention is directed to: http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm . These draft scopes of work are currently undergoing thorough review by the government to assure their contents clearly and accurately reflect the Governments requirements. Other services are separately funded under a companion contract (often on a fixed-price basis; however, time and materials or other terms and conditions can be used). Such services include: - Tenant Support - ACO Support - Specialized Testing - Production Base Support - Project Work, to include disposal activities and installation restoration - Execution of special programs for forestry, agriculture, fish, and wildlife programs - Commercial Reuse Efforts - Material Management Efforts - Planning for emergency demands in the event of a national emergency - BRAC transition project efforts. The mission of these facilities is the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) of finished ammunition product in support of DOD training and war-fighting requirements.  In order to fulfill this mission, these LAP facilities must possess sufficient expertise, capabil ity and capacity to provide manufacturing core capabilities consisting of melt-pour, the pressing of precision missile warheads, and the ability to LAP 120mm training and tactical tank rounds at IAAAP, and mortar melt-pour as well as C-4 extrusion, and hig h-speed loading of high explosive 40mm rounds at MLAAP. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS):  Numerous ARMS agreements are currently in place at each facility.  New Operating Contractor(s) (NOC(s)) will be required to retain and manage any ARMS Agreements in place at the time of the new Facilities Use contract award. Transition from Current Operating Contractor to NOC(s): Potential Encumbrances:  Both facilities may have production lines encumbered by the current operating contractor through 31 Dec 2012 (depending on the outcome of product solicitations currently in competition and other potential future product awards).  T he current operating contractor can elect one or both of the following if they are not the successful offeror under the new Facilities Use contract: - Negotiate an assignment of any then-ongoing production contracts with the NOC(s) - OR - Make appropriate payments to the NOC(s) for services provided to them as long as they remain the prime contractor under such production contracts.  Anticipated services which would be purchased from the NOC(s) include:  material handling/storage, technical  support, administrative, safety, security, and environmental. Total payments for 2009 are currently estimated at $30M for the services listed at:  http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm . It will be up to the NOC(s) to negotiate the appropriate amount of rent from the current operating contractor for the services provided in the outyears. Intellectual Property/Contractor-Owned Equipment: Whether in the near term or at the end of the current production contracts, the transition from the current operating contractor to NOC(s) also poses challenges in the areas of intellectual property and con tractor-owned equipment.  The current operating contractor may retain ownership of some proprietary production process information as well as some pieces of production equipment.  Due to the complexity of ownership and intellectual property issues, it appe ars these may best be resolved by making use of industrys expertise and assistance. Production Contracts: The Gove rnment does not intend to guarantee product with this acquisition, but it is considering the acquisition of some product at the time of award.  Specific quantities, terms, and conditions relative to such product are yet to be determined. However, items und er consideration include M112 demo charge, MICLIC, 40 lb Cratering Charge, and M107 and 75mm/105mm Blanks.  The 40mm LAP is also directed to MLAAP through at least 2009 (via systems contracts).  Refer to Transition from Current Operating Contractor to NOC (s) above for potential NOC(s) constraints in assuming such production. PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRATEGY: The U.S. Army, PEO Ammunition, and Joint Munitions Command propose the following: Issue one solicitation with the Government reserving the right to award one Facilities Use contract covering both facilities or two separate contracts (one for IAAAP, one for MLAAP), twenty-five years in length.   The Government contemplates a 25-year performance period for the contract to allow the contractor to plan for an optimum return on investments in an efficient, modern plant.  Periodically (proposed as every five years) the Government and contractor may rev iew the contract to incorporate changes necessitated by changes in Government policy, budgets, and the operating environment.  In addition, the Government may include periodic award term evaluations (proposed as every five years) to review contractor per formance with the Government option whether to extend the period of performance to the full 25 years. Potential offerors will have the opportunity to compete for one or both of the facilities but are not required to bid on both. Prospective offerors will provide technical proposals for the following: a. Operate & Maintain the Facility: Prospective offerors will be required to identify their proposed business and management approach to operating and maintaining the facility.  Offerors will be required to provide a Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS)  to accomplish the objectives set forth in Statements of Objectives for each of the identified base support tasks.  The PBWS will become part of the contract and the contractor will be required to perform these objectives through the implementation of thes e documents. b. Optimization Plan: Prospective offerors will be required to identify their plan(s) (one for Iowa, one for Milan, and/or both) for minimizing the total cost of operations to the Army (O&M, product, PBS, modernization) throughout the life of the contract.  Included might be such recommendations as modification and/or reduction/reconfiguration of facility footprint, infrastructure improvements, facility modernization, etc. c. Prospective offerors will also be required to demonstrate financial capability as well as a legal ability to assume ammunition related responsibilities. The Government will evaluate the proposals and make a best value source selection decision as to whether it is in our best interest to award one or two, twenty five year facilities use contract(s).  It is estimated that beginning no later than 01 Jan 09, the NOC(s) will assume the contractual duties as facilities use contractor(s). Supply and additional service requirements will be purchased through a companion contract(s) to the facilities use contract.  INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY: In responding to this RFI, potentially interested parties are asked to submit information on the following: 1. Briefly describe your company, products, services, history, ownership and any other information you deem relevant.  In particular, describe any contracts you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including m anagement and operations approach, ability to assume ammunition related responsibilities, financial capability, security requirements, and any relevant lessons learned. 2. Suggest or comment on the Armys proposed acquisition strategy as outlined above,  relative to the stated objectives.   3. Identify potential risks associated with the Armys proposed acquisition strategy, along with possible methods of mitigation. 4. Assess the likelihood of the Government achieving its objectives; also assess the likelihood of the Government achieving zero cost. 5. Assess the impact of the transition period on this acquisition.  6.  Provide recommendations on any preferred alternative strategy(s) that is capable of achieving the Armys aforementioned objectives for the proposed acquisition. 7. What, if any, incentives are needed to interest you in this facilities use contract. 8. Provide comments/recommendations on the proposed period of performance, periodic review of the contract, and award term provisions. 9. Provide comments on the draft scopes of work posted at the following Website; specifically, feedback on requirements contained within those documents which would not be applicable in a purely commercial ammunition production facility:   http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm .

Responses should be submitted to:  Ms. Cindy Peterman, Army Sustainment Command, ATTN:  AMSAS-ACA-L, Rock Island, IL  61299-6000 One-on-One Discussions: It is the Governments intent to hold one-on-one discussions with respondents to this RFI sometime in Feb 07.

<CONTACT>Kristina Lukin, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4562
<DESC>The following is a list of questions and answers for the PA117 Containers: Question 1:  Pricing Data and Part I â€“ Price, the instructions do not ask for  anything except for filling in Section B, yet in the General Instructions, â€œone  hard copyâ€ has to include the cost volume.  Would this just be a copy of  Section B from the solicitation? Answer 1: Per Section M, we only ask to see the unit price per year, so yes  copy of Section B. Question 2:  L.1.2.2 Part II:  Technical and L.1.2.4.2 Part II Technical both  show a page limit of 30 pages.  Do we actually have 60 pages in the technical  section or do we have a total of only 30 pages?  With two different â€œL.1â€¦ â€œ  numbers it looks as if there are 2 sections with 30 pages each. Answer 2:  Both L.1.2.2 Part II: Technical and L.1.2.4.2 Part II â€“ Technical  refer to the same requirement.  The total is 30 pages. Question 3:  Have these metal containers been subcontracted to Industry before: Answer:  Yes. Question 4:  What quantities should be quoted? Answer 4: Quantities are shown on Section B for each Item Number. Question 5:  Does the Government intend to award this contract on a sole-source  or multiple-source basis? Answer 5:  Only one contract award will be made. Question 6:  Does the Government own the design of these metal containers? Answer 6:  Yes. Question 7:  Will the Government consider an 8A set-aside on this program? Answer 7:  No. Question 8:  Have funds been made available for this acqusition yet? Answer 8:  Short-of-Award authority. Question 9:  Is the Government willing to offer an extension to the submission  date of 4 January 2007. Answer 9:  Closing date has been extended from 4 January 2007 to 16 January  2007.  Amendment 0001 was posted to ProcNet and Fed Biz Opps extending the  closing date on 22 December 2007.

<SOLNBR>BAA-CRIISRPI0001
<RESPDATE>022807
<ARCHDATE>04022007
<CONTACT>Mari Beckler, (505) 678-1158
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Agency, White Sands Directorate (WSMR DOC), White Sands Missile Range in support of Test Resource Management Center, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), is soliciting white papers and proposals, both technical and cost f or the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Rapid Prototyping Initiative (RPI) from qualified corporations, research institutes, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), DoD laboratories and centers, and o ther US government organizations under the BAA CRIIS RPI # 0001.   The CRIIS RPI is to provide capabilities for the generation, collection and real time distribution of precision Time Space Position Information (TSPI) from Dismounted Soldiers (DS) and Low Dynamic Vehicles (LDV) engaged in complex Test and Evaluation (T&E)  events. For the purposes of this solicitation Low Dynamic Vehicles are considered to be ground or air vehicles that are subjected to sustained accelerations of 4 gs or less.  It is expected that solutions will make use of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, to generate the TSPI data, coupled to Radio Frequency (RF) modems that serve as Data Links (DLs) to form a regional data network.  (Note: vendors may propose non-GPS based solutions.) Within this network the system will provide the capability to  generate and distribute TSPI data from as a few as one participant to as many as two thousand simultaneous participants in real time.  Vendors should not expect this acquisition to fund significant non-recurring engineering cost as solutions are expected to be able to heavily leverage Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technology and/or Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) technology where practical and beneficial.  Largely complete to complete pre-existing solutions are desired.  Successful vendors must be able t o deliver the first participant packages to the Government by mid May 2007.  The BAA is conducted using full and open competition. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA uses a two- step process. The first step will be the submission of a white paper.  The white paper must contain as a minimum: Title, Period o f Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude Cost, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email, Task Objective, Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.  Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the int ent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two).  The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award.  White papers submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A white papers technical evaluation and its im portance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  White papers will be accepted continuously through 28 Feb 2007.    OFFEROR INFORMATION: Evaluations may take up to 30 days from receipt of White Paper to complete.    Numerous awards may result from this BAA and will depend upon the quality and merit of white papers and proposals received and available funding. If the Gov ernment decides to pursue a concept with regard to this BAA a formal proposal will be requested.  Award of any contracts resulting from this BAA is anticipated to occur in FY07.    If selected, you must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/) in order to receive the award.  If you are not in the CCR at the time we are ready to make the award, you will be disqualified. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to fund any white paper, pay any proposal prep aration cost s, or to award any contract.     All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper, which will be considered. No portion of this announcement is set aside for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's)  or minority institutions (MI's); proposals are invited from all sources. The Government     reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the white papers or proposals received in response to this announcement.  The CRIIS RPI BAA, instructions for the submission of white papers and required proposal summary form are published at the WSMR DOC web site located at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm .  Potential sources are reminded that it is their responsibility to frequently check this website for any issues and updates regarding this Broad Agency Announcement. White papers are to be submitted electronically on CD-ROM in Microsoft Office 2003 or highe r.  The original and one copy of the CD-ROMs shall be submitted to Army Contracting Agency White Sands Directorate. Deadline for questions is 28 January 2007. Email your questions to Norma Martinez at martineznm@wsmr.army.mil. The date and time for submiss ion of the completed white papers and the proposal summary form, is 12 Noon Mountain Standard Time, 28 Feb 2007. Point of Contact  Norma M.

<DESC>The Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE) Program Office, 500 Combat Sustainment Squadron (Battle Management) 500 CBSS/GBLD invites prospective contractors to an UPS Fuel Cell Industry Day to be held on 28 February 2007, 8:30 a.m., at the Ridley Mission Control Facility, Bldg 1441, Edwards AFB CA.  Contractors planning to attend must contact Mike Dougherty, Program Manager, at the following email address, Michael.dougherty@hill.af.mil, no later than 30 January 2007 with the names of those attending.  Due to space limitations, participation for this Industry Day will be limited to three people per contractor.  Also, due to site security requirements, only US citizens will be allowed to attend.

It is the intent of the PCCIE Program Office, which is the United States Air Force Product Group Manager for PCCIE, to explore the feasibility of utilizing fuel cell technology in an effort to replace in total or augment UPS batteries at a remote location at Edwards AFB Ca.  Attendees must have the capability to design a complete cradle to grave UPS solution which is unique for Edwards AFB, CA, including a qualified UPS which meets Air Force standards, ancillary equipment e.g. remote monitoring, installation, set up and removal and follow on maintenance of any current UPS equipment.  A contractor must also have a proven 20 to 30kVA, three phase, on-line, double conversion UPS fuel cell system that has previously been fielded. PCCIE engineers will be available to answer questions on the current Air Force standards for UPS equipment. Additionally, PCCIE administers an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract and is looking to incorporate fuel cell technology into future procurements.  Additional information will be provided to those contractors who are interested in attending regarding the sites access requirements.

This specification applies to on-line/reverse transfer, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems. This specification is for Commercially Available Equipment (CAE) and defines requirements for the contractor to completely engineer, furnish, install and test UPS Systems worldwide.  Services include providing various engineering and technical services, and accomplishing reconfiguration, upgrading, and expansion of an existing UPS Systems, as well as installing new UPS systems under this contract. The contractor shall provide all efforts needed to design, supply, test, transport, survey, install, start-up, train personnel, deliver, de-install and dispose of old equipment, warrant, and maintain UPS/UPS systems as described herein. The contractor shall provide a turn-key system, consisting of the UPS equipment, ancillary equipment, material and services, which satisfy the site specific unique power needs.  Due to the diversity of sites and installations, equipment, system design and configuration shall be appropriate for the facility and application, e.g. computer room, office environment, industrial area, austere, or pristine conditions.  When specified at the time of order, the contractor shall ensure all subcontractors provide the same support, maintenance, data, and warranty requirements levied on the contractor. Ancillary equipment shall only be supplied as part of a UPS system acquired under this contract.
 
 The UPS provided shall be on-line/reverse transfer.  Double Conversion (on-line/reverse transfer) systems are defined as those UPS systems which provide continuous filtered power to the load.  When commercial power fails, the inverter section draws needed power from a DC source (usually a battery), with no mechanical switching action on the load.  If the on-line/reverse transfer UPS system fails, it automatically transfers the load back to the bypass source with no interruption to the critical load.

The Contracting Officer (CO), Linda R. Ellis, is the point of contact for this acquisition.  Address any questions or concerns you may have to the CO.  Email is the preferred method of communication. Questions regarding the above must be submitted in writing to the CO no later than 14 February 2006.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. The government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AUTHORITY:

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) currently utilizes the Boson NetSim CCNP system for extensive training of communications personnel on Cisco network infrastructure support equipment.  The complexity of the network infrastructure, the sensitivity of JCSE network support and the nature of JCSE training require a seamless transition of training materials between the classroom and the field environment.  JCSE currently has the Boson system installed on 26 training systems at a cost of approximately $49,000.00 for hardware and software.  An additional $19,000.00 has been spent on another 13 systems in anticipation of installing the Boson system in order to expand our training capability.  Furthermore, approximately 240 GS-11 equivalent man hours have been spent in developing training materials for the Boson integration into the JCSE systems.  The cost to the Government of testing and installing a similar type of software, in terms of time and money, exceed any savings that would be achieved through competition of this requirement.

<SUBJECT>D -- WebEx On-Line Conferencing Services
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Administrative Resource Center?s (ARC) Business Technology Division, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with WebEx Communications, Inc., for the acquisition of on-line conferencing services.

At this time, the Government intends to award for the period of 12 months.                       

Nature & Description of Action

The Business Technology Division implemented a program, approximately six years ago, for training and providing demos for new/potential customers, remotely but in real-time.
 
WebEx was selected because it does not require a particular type of software or internet browser. The specific needs of ARC preclude using any other commercial sources for the WebEx services, as ARC?s needs for the customized package of Meeting Center and Support Center, along with the size of the package, are only available from WebEx. As to avoid the cost and time that would be incurred changing to an entirely different application, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue using WebEx for these services.  These services need to go into effect January 6, 2007.
 
Based on this information, a sole source to WebEx Communications, Inc. is intended for this contract.

No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than January 2, 2007. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to WebEx Communications, Inc. (DBA: WebEx.com).

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to psb2@bpd.treas.gov. E-mail responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.  We are unable to receive the following computer file extensions: .bat, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .gz, .hta, .pif, .rar, .scr, .tgz, .vbs, .z, and .zip.

a) Support a current VIP/SAM air fleet of 6 simultaneous aircraft worldwide with a desire for the number of simultaneous aircraft to increase
b) For any near-term solutions (prior to 2009), no modifications to the airframes are possible while only form, fit, and function modifications internal to the aircraft should be considered
c) Systems must meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight safety standards for usage upon commercial aircraft
d) Utilize low-profile / conformal antennas acceptable to the commercial airline industry
e) Provide world-wide northern hemisphere coverage of the major air routes as a minimum with the objective of full world-wide mid-latitude (between 60o N and 60o S latitude) coverage
f) Provide a proven high system availability rate
g) Support for 20+ simultaneous users with throughputs capable of supporting:
(1)Real-time, two-way, high speed internet access
(2)Government Intranet access
(3)E-mail
(4)Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
(5)Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for LCF Testing of seventy (70) ME3/Rene 104 disk superalloy specimens to be LCF tested at temperatures of 400-1300F as described as follows:  The specimens are:  Drawing No.		Description 1)  4013195-203 	0.40¡¨ gage dia. LCF specimen with button-head ends from ¡V731P03 2)  PGR-3-1997		0.40¡¨ gage dia. LCF specimen with button-head ends from ¡V731P03short. The drawings will be uploaded.	If you have any issues or problems opening the drawings, please contact the the primary point of contact by e-mail. Please quote assuming at least 10 specimens would be shipped for testing at a time.  A testing time of 4 weeks after receipt of specimens is desired.	Deliveries of partial quantities are encouraged and will be acceptable for meeting delivery time requirements in large orders.  TESTING: 1)  Low Cycle Fatigue Tests - The vendor shall run strain-controlled or load-controlled fatigue tests according to the latest ASTM E-606 standards.  Stress-strain hysteresis loops at periodic cycles as well as tabulated results including initial and half life values of modulus, maximum and minimum stresses, and inelastic strain range shall be reported as appropriate; as well as expansion strain, initiation life, and failure life.  The tables shall be provided as hard copies and on a computer disk as Excel spread sheets.  Tested specimens and remnant material from machining shall be returned.  Then for elevated temperatures up to 1300„aF, please quote quantity discounted unit price for E-606 strain-controlled fatigue tests and load-controlled fatigue tests of these specimens.  The test quote should be provided for tests assumed to run all at 1300F for a total time duration of 48 hours, using the procedures described below.	 2)  The following LCF testing procedures should be utilized; deviations from this should be coordinated with the Government Representative at NASA GRC prior to conducting the tests: LCF specimen tests:   1.	The shanks of all LCF specimens shall be shotpeened, while the gage sections are masked for protection from shotpeening.  2.	Measure and control temperature using a procedure specifically pre-agreed with NASA 3.	First run 10+ cycles in load control, then 10+ cycles in strain control, both at about 0.2% strain range (R=0) with tight interlocked limits to check extensometer stability and the test system¡¦s control stability. 4.	Start test using an agreed startup procedure which gradually increases the strain range to the target value at a slow frequency of 0.05 hertz while avoiding overstrains.  Then continue the test at a frequency of 0.33 hertz for 24 hours.  Then: a.	If max. and min. cyclic stresses are stabilized, please switch to load control at 10 hertz with the same max. and min. cyclic stresses, run to 5x106 cycles runout. b.	If cyclic stresses are still relaxing by more than 1 ksi per 500 cycles, continue until stabilized for mode switch for up to 2 more hours.  Call if not yet stabilized. 5.	Run most tests to failure, agreed tensile load drop, or agreed runout cycles.  Place fracture specimen halves in the plastic tube with the button ends butting together, fracture surfaces protected from metal contact. 6.	It will be requested that several tests be stopped approximately three to four times during the life of the specimen at NASA specified cycle increments.  Do not assume any tests will be interrupted in the quote.  After each interruption the specimens shall be separately packaged, marked with specimen ID number and send for an overnight mail delivery shipment to NASA. After the first interruption the tests shall be switched from strain control to load control and cycled for a designated number of fatigue cycles.  Initial set up fee for strain control as well as subsequent set up fee for load control testing segments shall be assumed for any interrupted tests. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-14. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.

<DESC>Amendment #01:
The purpose of this Amendment #01, is to answer contractor questions and extend the Quotation Due Date.  
Solicitation Reminder:  A contractor will have to provide awarded backpacks within 4 calendar days of being notified of Government need for each class.

The following questions and answers are hereby incorporated into the solicitation (and subsequent purchase order).

1.  Is the leather on the bottom of the bag to be "Split", or  "Full Grain" or is there any type of tanning needed?
Answer:  The leather can be ?split? or ?Full Grain? with or without tanning.  Basic need for a leather bottom is for durability and appropriateness given the rest of the requirement.

2.  Can contractor use Monofilament Kevlar thread in place of bonded or semi-fused multi-strand Kevlar?
Answer:  Kevlar thread is appropriate.

3.  Please define the thread called ?Ballistic thread? is it nylon or Nomex or Kevlar?
Answer:  Kevlar thread.  The wording ?ballistic? was used as a slang, but the Kevlar is the correct thread to use.

4.   What sorts of things will be held in this backpack?  At 75 pounds load weight it is difficult for us to think it is only books and papers, and we want to make sure we leave appropriate room.  If it is normal books and papers, we may want to divide the main section:  Is there any requirement on the main section open space? 
Answer:  See Solicitation.  Thick law books, binders, study guides, etc. No divider needed.

5.  Is there any specific use for the two zippered front pockets and the zippered side pocket?  We would want to know if there were, as there are no size requirements (please send size requirements) for those pockets.
Answer:  Pens, pencils, ID, cell phone, calculator, keys, etc. Female students don't carry purses so they use the pockets for personal items.  A particular size is not mandated as long as tall enough to hold a pencil and wide enough to hold a calculator.

6.  Your solicitation calls for leather bottom?  We would plan to use an alternative that we already know from use and testing as appropriate.  Would you allow for a different bottom? 
Answer: Yes, if durable. The backpacks are kept on the floor and take a lot of abuse if bottom of bag or seams separate the bag will be returned and replacement provided at no cost to the Government.  Note: multiple quotes are allowed per each backpack provided in accordance with the solicitation.  The Government retains the right to reject any non-leather bottom backpack based on their preference.

7.  We do not use nylon ballistic thread, although we certainly could purchase it for the order.  We believe in the strength of the thread we do use (100% bonded nylon #69 - ('#70, tek'), or  #99 - ('#90, tek')design.  Would a sample without the nylon ballistic thread be acceptable? 
Answer:  No. We've used other bags with other threads that didn't hold up. This thread with double-stitching prevents bag from tearing due to weight of books.

8.  The zipper that we normally use is domestic YKK continuous coil zipper with nylon tape, which we believe is stronger.  However, we would be happy to fulfill, with the YKK Vislon, the order you would place. May we use our own thread for just the sample and provide the required thread with an order?
No.  The backpacks are being evaluated per the specs, if a bag does not meet the specs it can?t be evaluated on an equal basis with other backpacks received.  

9.  Your solicitation does not say what Pantone color thread.  We assume it would be a shade of black, and we assume that for the sample purpose any shade of black would be acceptable. 
Answer:  Yes, black thread.

10.   We are not sure what your solicitation means by "double stitching."  To some people, "double stitching" means 2 lines of stitching on the same line, and to some people it means one line of stitching and then a parallel line of stitching.  Which one is required?  
Answer:  Two lines of stitching on the same line.

11.   Would you accept a Camel Pack backpack this type backpack has a water bladder installed in it? 
Answer:  No, water bladder not needed.

12.  Can we provide more than one backpack with proposal?
Answer:  You may provide as many quotes as you like per each backpack submitted as long as the backpack meets the minimum requirements of the specification.

The Due Date for quotes is changed from January 5, 2007 to January 10, 2007, no later than 2:00p.m. local time (Easter Time). 

All other terms, specifications, and conditions remain unchanged.

SUBJECT:  Amendment to Include Referenced Attachments to Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Logistics Specialist in Washington, DC.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.)  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
