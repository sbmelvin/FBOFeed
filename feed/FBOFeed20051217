<DESC>This acquisition is to establish a requirements contract for the following item.  Item 0001 NSN: 3655-00-995-8579, P/N: MIL-PRF-27720F, NOUN: Liquid Storage Tank.  FUNC: The Storage Tank is a complete, self- contained, skid-mounted unit for the storage of liquid oxygen, the air transport of the filled unit to the point of use, and, for the transfer of the liquid product into small servicing containers.  It will store up to 400 gallons of liquid oxygen at its atmospheric boiling temperature (-296 F for liquid oxygen).  The Storage Tank consists of an inner tank suspended inside an outer tank or jacket.  The inner tank, containing liquid oxygen, is wrapped with layers of insulation and is separated from the outer tank by a vacuum like a large Thermos bottle.  The control housing, at the front of the Storage Tank, protects the valves and other controls for the Tank.  The pressure buildup coil is at the bottom of the control housing.  It acts as a heat-exchanger, where the liquid product is converted to gas, providing vapor pressure to the storage Tank.  The basic quantity is eight (8) each.  A first article is required for all manufacturers, except those who have completed a contract (for the Government) for this item in the last 60 months.  There will be four (4) annual options: the first option quantity is five (5) each, the remaining options are for a quantity of six (6) each.  The Estimated Total Quantity is 31 each.  

Technical data is available.  Tentative Destination: Robins AFB GA 31098, Delivery is three (3) months after receipt of order.  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  An RFP will follow.  The estimated award date is 30 September 2005.

<DESC>LINE		DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLY	        QTY		
			
0001	Kevlar Combat Helmets (Level IIIA)	11,891	
        Green or Woodland Camouflage with Chin Strap

***  Helmets MUST meet NIJ Level IIIA specifications IAW NIJ Standard 0106.01 and meet MIL-STD-662E requirements.  NIJ Approved Laboratory V50 testing certificates documenting NIJ Level IIIA compliance must be submitted with proposals.  ANY OFFEROR WHO FAILS TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR PROVIDE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION WILL BE DEEMED UNRESPONSIVE AND REMOVED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

Solicitation will be posted to FBO on 16 Dec 05. 

All quotes should be submitted to robert.brooks@pco-iraq.net

Preferred method of submission is email attachment.  Unable to receive faxes.

Q:  1) Are you requesting only Kevlar with the helmets or would an equal ballistic fiber that meets the specifications be acceptable ?
2) Clin 002, Do you want extra chin straps for the helmets ? (all helmets come with a chin strap)
A:  Kevlar only…11, 891 chin straps…no more, no less…

Q:  When is closing date for W9GY0-06-Q-0043?
A:  22 Dec 1630 Baghdad Time…

Q.  Are the chin straps listed additional chin straps required or do you want them priced separately from the helmets?
A:  Chin straps are not additional…if part of the helmet ensemble, separate pricing not required…

Q:  1) You mention Mil Std 662E requirements.  It is my understanding that this is a test protocol used to measure v50 performance against certain projectiles.
Can you further define the minimum level of v50 required and the projectile to be used in the test?

2) You also mention the requirement for" NIJ approved laboratory V50 testing certificates documenting NIJ level IIIA compliance".  It is my understanding that a NIJ level IIIA compliance requires a V0 test result for certification.  Please clarify the requirement.

3) You mention NIJ 0106.01 certification.  Is the test data required the ballistic portion of this test only or is it also the Acceleration measurement portion.  If it includes the acceleration measurement portion testing then I am unaware of any NIJ certified lab that has the necessary equipment to perform this test. 
 
4)The NIJ 0106.01 standard only addresses ballistic testing up to threat level II only, not IIIA.  How is one to obtain certification if the standard does not allow such certification?

A:  Ballistic Testing requirements continue to evolve…NIJ 0106.01 addresses Level I and II as MINIMUM performance requirements…NIJ approved independent labs will certify helmets to level IIIA…certification to a higher level is what we are requesting…the requested testing standard reflects NIJ 0106.01 Level IIIA…there are a number of companies with documentation reflecting this exact certification…
Please contact United States Test Laboratory, LLC., 7447 W. 33rd St. N., Wichita, KS 67205 Phone: (316) 832-1600 Fax: (316) 832-1602 to address technical testing requirements.  If your product has been tested in one of the approved NIJ testing laboratories, showing NIJ 0106.01 Level IIIA testing was performed/passed, then you will be considered compliant and therefore responsive…
