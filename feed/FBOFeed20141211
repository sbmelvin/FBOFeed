This first Stryker ECP DVH brigade will be similar to the FBH/DVH Exchange program, except that the reclaimed common components from the FBH donor vehicles will be installed in a production ECP DVH Stryker.  This 4th Stryker brigade will be created based on a Stryker FBH direct to Stryker ECP DVH brigade set conversion process.   <br>  <br> GDLS is the only known source with the unique background and engineering expertise required for the complex vehicle engineering tasks associated with producing the Stryker FBH directly to a DVH ECP. GDLS is also the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of all Stryker variants and retains ownership of the TDP. GDLS is also already in the process of taking a Stryker DVH to a Stryker DVH ECP by performing the Engineering Design, Prototype Development, Logistics, Test, and Evaluation Support under the ECP Phase II Contract W56HZV-14-C-B019. <br>  <br> To maximize subcontracting opportunities, the OEM will be directed contractually to compete work at principal subcontractor and lower tier vendor levels in support of Government competition objectives.  <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which the agency will consider. <br>

<SUBJECT>Pre-Solicitation of a Prospectus for Marina and Associated Operations, Lodging, Food Service, RV Parks, Boat Rentals, and Retail Sales All associated with serving the Recreating Public at New Melones Lake, Sonora, California
<SOLNBR>MP-14-238
<RESPDATE>021315
<CONTACT>Peggi Brooks, Chief, Recreation Resources Division, Phone 916-978-7180, Email PBrooks@usbr.gov - Dan Holsapple, Recreation Planner, Phone (916) 989-7170, Email dholsapple@usbr.gov
<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Reclamation, through this Prospectus, is outlining opportunities for a new expanded concession operation at New Melones Lake. This Prospectus is for the development of a marina and other commercial services that provide facilities and services as have been determined by the New Melones Lake Area Resource Management Plan and related documents. The planning effort that culminated in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) in 2010 provides the basic guidance for a new concession operation at New Melones. Reclamation has completed an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impacts (EA/FONSI) for the issuance of this prospectus identifying concession area boundaries and recreation services that shall be required along with additional services that would be authorized. The EIS and ROD, EA/FONSI, plus numerous other helpful documents mentioned throughout this Prospectus, may be viewed by visiting a specially developed New Melones Prospectus website at http://www.usbr.gov/mp/ccao/newmelones<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Business opportunities for the next concession contract term may include a full service marina, limited overnight lodging, houseboat and pleasure boat rentals, retail sales, RV Park, and day use facilities. Some operations may be seasonal in nature while others will serve year-round business demands. There may also be other appropriate facilities and activities that Offerors will suggest as a part of their unique proposals. It is likely that successful Offerors will propose a development program that requires substantial new concession investment. (Please see PART 5 of the attached Prospectus for detailed information on the proposal evaluation process to be conducted by Reclamation).<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Concession operations at New Melones have been operating in a very similar manner for over 25 years. However, since the construction of the original marina, there have been weather related and wave action incidents which has led to the conclusion that major portions of the marina must be relocated to a more protected cove. The new contract will provide for a new marina location that is much more protected. The current water based operations shall be terminated with the new contract except for the water area for the mooring ball field, which shall be available as a seasonal operation. The land portion of the original marina area will be available as part of the new contract, along with new land areas in the expanded concession boundary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Land based operations may continue to be utilized in the existing marina concession boundary. The concession area water well and one (possibly two if the outgoing 1 concessionaire leaves the one they own) 55,000 gallon potable water storage tanks are available and located adjacent to the existing maintenance building.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A maintenance yard is fenced and utilized by the current concession contractor for storage of concession-related personal property including rental houseboats, pleasure boats, and personal watercraft during the off-season or when demand for them is low. Sufficient land space is available in the existing land based operations to permit the maintenance yard to be expanded for the provision of Dry Yard Storage for houseboats seasonally moored in the Mooring Ball Field.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Additional land based facilities include paved and unpaved roads, a paved marina access ramp, two paved parking lots with overhead lighting and one unpaved parking lot, and a full hook-up RV site for temporary occupancy by the concession manager and/or site security staff. Additional facilities may be available for temporary use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Boat and houseboat rentals, RV sites, attractively designed cabin/yurt installations, and quality day use opportunities are all services that, following the re-development, should show immediate visitor demand. Current occupancy levels on rental boat slips at the existing marina is already nearly 100% and increases and upgrades in those Fixed Assets will also be met with continued user popularity. In addition, an existing waiting list for marina slips indicates a high interest in having a boat moored at New Melones.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It is apparent that this opportunity at New Melones Lake will require some well managed and timed phasing for new development to realize all of the apparent benefits. Reclamation is prepared to work closely with the eventual new concession contractor in approving and helping to coordinate the re-development of commercial public facilities. This Prospectus will be open for a period of 60 days in recognition of the complexities involved and the potential for individual Offerors to develop proposals. There are also inherent complexities in this opportunity because of the relocation of the marina and development of new RV camping and lodging opportunities.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">With the change to a business model that is committed to the provision of new facilities and services, Reclamation foresees outstanding commercial opportunities at New Melones Lake. New Melones is readily accessible by millions of potential visitors. It is within 3 hours drive of the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento and other municipalities in central California. The location, environment, scenic vistas and a multitude of outdoor recreation opportunities at New Melones Lake and vicinity make this a desirable location for a marina and related water-based commercial recreation services. Together, this presents a financially viable business opportunity favorable for the establishment of appropriately designed recreation facilities and services with outstanding growth potential over the term of the next concession contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The current concession contractor does not have any preferential rights for consideration on the next contract term nor will the eventual new operator have preference for the contract term following this opportunity.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Reclamation will provide through this Prospectus, opportunities for prospective Offerors to tour existing facilities, ask appropriate questions and express concerns regarding aspects of this concession business opportunity (see PART 3 Section B of the attached Prospectus).<br /> <br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #363636;">**This announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer nor any solicitation of any offer or </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">commit the Government </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #363636;">to purchase, otherwise acquire, issue, subscribe for, or sell any services.**</span><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"></span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">The DARPA ElectRx program seeks innovative research proposals for creating closed-loop neuromodulation systems that utilize innate neurophysiological circuits to achieve therapeutic benefits. To achieve this goal, ElectRx will simultaneously drive biological understanding and technology development. Specifically, ElectRx is looking to develop and leverage fundamental understanding of the anatomy and physiology of neural circuits in the spinal cord or peripheral nerves that mediate health status.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This knowledge will be leveraged to design and demonstrate feedback-controlled neuromodulation systems for the direct regulation of immune system functions and CNS disorders. In parallel, technology development focused on next-generation minimally-invasive neural interfaces and biosensors will enable interaction with the neurophysiology of interest at unmatched spatiotemporal resolution, precision, and specificity. These neuromodulation treatments will be tuned automatically and continuously to the unique physiology of each individual and will produce no off-target effects.&nbsp; Additional information set forth in attached BAA.</p>

<DESC>DLA Energy will be issuing a procurement for the long term (20 years) supply and purchase of electricity generated from newly constructed renewable energy generation assets for delivery to various Naval Installations located in the Middle Atlantic Region (MidLant) and PJM market footprint. The procurement will be executed using the authority under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2922a. Under this procurement, the Government plans to enter into a long term Renewable Energy Supply Agreement (RESA) whereby a Contractor agrees to finance, design, install, operate and maintain a renewable power generation system on private land and the Government will agree to purchase the energy produced from the system at a firm-fixed price. DLA Energy will request competitive proposals for the purchase and delivery of the off-site renewable energy for a 20 year period to Philadelphia Depot Mechanicsburg, Naval Support Activity (NSA) Philadelphia, Earle Naval Weapons Station, and Naval Station (NAVSTA) Great Lakes.
<p>The RFP will request that the Contractor furnish all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and incidentals required to produce and deliver electricity generated from a newly constructed off-site renewable energy generation system, including all associated Environmental Attributes, capable of meeting up to 100% of the electricity requirements of the above listed installations. This totals 217,885,331 kWhs annually. At a minimum, the Contractor's system must be capable of supplying at least 113,000,000 kWhs annually. Contractors proposing less than the full requirement may propose to supply the balance of power from conventional energy resources. However, the Government will not consider proposals where the conventional power quantities exceed 48% of any single year requirement.</p>
<p>The Contactor shall deliver all electricity into the Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland Power Pool (PJM), provide the interconnection agreement, maintenance, and ancillary services to properly supply the renewable power to the point of utility inter-connection, and then schedule it with the local utility for ultimate supply to the Navy meters.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for a&nbsp;mobile terminal scanner repair/replacement plan. The Interagency Cache Business System (ICBS) is an inventory management application. These "caches" are used to house equipment and supplies used in fire suppression and non-fire incident response activities. <br /><br />ICBS is based on a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software product called IBM Sterling&reg; Warehouse Management System. ICBS provides real-time location-level inventory visibility. This is made possible by scanning a product and location bar code label every time an item is moved in the warehouse. The infrastructure for this includes a wireless local area network (WLAN) attached to an agency network, and hand-held wireless mobile terminal devices (bar code scanners).<br />

<a href="mailto:Bobby.J.Holden@nasa.gov">Bobby J. Holden</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support of Architect-Engineer (A/E) Miscellaneous Environmental Engineering and Occupational Health Services at Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) located in California, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Alabama and other NASA centers and installations under the current contract which provides engineers with environmental compliance experience, professionals with experience in Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) investigation/clean-up, natural resources specialists, cultural resources specialists, chemists, risk assessors, community relations specialists, and hydrogeologists.  Registered, licensed professionals will oversee all work under this contract and will stamp all prepared documents.  These activities emphasize supporting the missions of MSFC, SSFL and other NASA installations in a safe, reliable and timely manner. <p> The A/E services will include the range of tasks outlined as follows: <P> 1.  Conduct studies and prepare permit applications, plans, and reports in support of environmental compliance activities at MSFC. Compliance activities include Clean Air Act permits and reports, Clean Water Act permits and reports, pollution prevention, natural and cultural resource management, energy management and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation, and other Federal, State and local regulations. <P> 2.  Prepare documentation as required under either federal or state implemented RCRA and CERCLA; perform field investigations; analytical laboratory services; groundwater modeling; environmental studies; perform risk assessments and risk evaluations; treatability tests; demonstration projects; corrective measures studies; feasibility studies; engineering design documentation; munitions and explosives of concern investigations; and construction/remediation oversight. <P> 3.  Prepare ISO 9000 and ISO 14000-based or compatible environmental management system documents. <P> 4.  Conduct environmental compliance audits and root cause analysis. <P> 5.  Perform Environmental Engineering feasibility and cost studies and prepare Preliminary Engineering Report (PER's) and final design packages for environmental, energy, and other engineering-related projects at MSFC. <P> The A/E contract is a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.  It is recommended this action be accomplished through a 2-year extension to the A/E contract with CH2M Hill, Inc. (CH2M). NASA/MSFC intends to extend the period of performance of the current contract from May 31, 2015 through May 31, 2017 and increase the ID/IQ contract ceiling by $35M.  It is anticipated that the re-competition for this procurement will begin June 1, 2016.  Approval of this action will allow for continuation and stability of these services to ensure mission critical environmental engineering and occupational health services goals are met. <P> As the current A/E contractor, CH2M is uniquely positioned to continue providing A/E services in support of MSFC, SSFL, and other NASA centers and installations.  For approximately 50 years, the SSFL was utilized for the development, test and validation of various fuels and solvents which have over the years collected in the ground water and caused contamination.  Federal and State environmental laws require remediation of areas followed by a period of monitoring for SSFL and MSFC. California law requires that remediation be sustained, without cessation, through completion.  The required Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) schedules are extremely challenging, with many interrelated components which are being managed by CH2M in order to achieve the interim and final deadlines. The schedules are achievable with no impacts to the presently planned and ongoing work being performed by CH2M, but there is significant risk that the schedule will not be met should there be a disruption in the services CH2M is providing or if a contract transition occurs prior to NASA satisfying the cleanup requirements. These actions are scheduled to be completed by May 2017. No other source is capable of completing the tasks discussed above in the timeframe specified. Use of CH2Ms existing and proven capabilities will permit the execution of significant tasks that are necessary for achieving NASA/MSFC milestones without delay.  A re-competition of the A/E contract would introduce considerable schedule risks and unacceptable delays to the program and mission goals. <P> The government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> This synopsis is for information only due to the nature of the environmental remediation effort ongoing at SSFL.    <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <P> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <P> NASA clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (BRAND-NAME-Cartagenia Inc.).
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Cartagenia, 485 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 300, Cambridge, MA 02139-0418 to provide</p>
<p>THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.</p>
<p>Procurement:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Add Amazon Web Services;<br />2. Set-up new dedicated private cloud, VPN and firewall and adapt Bench Connector to new environment;and<br />3. Support Assistance for Bench NGS and Bench Connector optimization in the UDPics environment (for 60-Days).<br /><br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National<br />Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address<br />the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found<br />despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and <br />discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The multi-<br />user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures,<br />engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system.</p>
<p>UDP continues to work in conjunction with Cartagenia to continue providing Bench NGS and Bench Connector services and support to NHGRI UDP LIMS System. Cartagenia is the sole provider of the BENCH platform of software that the UDP laboratory has used for the past year. This software platform is unique that it offers a standardized data interpretation from both high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing and microarray data for its analysis and has been modified to fit NHGRI needs. The BENCH platform has the ability to detect structural and molecular variation measured by different technologies that includes copy number variation, loss of heterozygosity, single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions, and variant classification status (benign, pathogenic, etc.)</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Cartagenia Bench platform software is required by the Undiagnosed Diseases laboratory to reliably and systematically sift through large lists of patient genome variants derived from next generation sequencing and SNP microarray data in order to make informed calls on variants that are potentially deleterious and the cause of the unique disorders seen in admitted Undiagnosed Diseases Program patients. The intramural NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) has been given the additional mandates of founding and training extramural UDP sites and providing classes for analysis of next generation sequencing data and SNP chips. To this end, the UDP requires a mechanism by which it can uniformly provide mentoring and a common database for analysis of genomic and sequence variants.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The Cartagenia BENCH Communication Module (BCM) has already been integrated into the UDP LIMs system. In conjunction with NIH Security Standards, Cartagenia shall supply the hosting of Amazon Web Services. Additionally, they shall develop and set up the newly dedicated UDP private cloud, VPN and firewall in order to meet the specifics of the UDP LIMs system. Finally, Cartagenia shall provide the optimization of both BENCH NGS and BENCH Connector to this new environment. These integration services are an integral part of the LIMS development and connectivity that will allow the transfer of data from the Cartagenia software to other analysis software, to collaborators and to generate necessary reports. Cartagenia is the sole provider of the BENCH platform software and is the only provider of the BENCH Communication Module as well as the LIMs Integration services that will accompany the module.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research seeks to continue the advancement of SSL weapon system designs, architectures, and component technologies. The government believes that improvements in lethality may be achieved through maturation and optimization of a variety of system characteristics, including laser power (government estimates indicate that systems with laser power of 100-150 kW may be supportable using ship power and cooling), beam quality, beam director architecture, and other physical and optical aspects of the laser, beam director, and system design. Furthermore, the government believes that duty cycle, operability, and maintainability improvements may be accomplished through system architecture, system design attributes, and maturation and optimization of component technologies, potentially including modification of commercially available components.<br /><br />Under this BAA, the government plans a design, build, test, and demonstration effort to mature the system, sub-systems, and component technologies necessary to produce a Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) consisting of a performer-supplied Tactical Laser Core Module (TLCM), integrated by the performer with required government-furnished elements and subsystems. The LWSD will be installed by the Government aboard a Navy test ship with representative support system constraints (e.g. ship's power and cooling, sensors, etc.) and demonstrated at sea. During the at sea demonstration, the LWSD will be operated from the ship to execute live-fire engagements in day and night conditions under operationally derived test scenarios consistent with ship self-defense missions including countering threats from adversary Fast Attack Craft/Fast In-Shore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and sensor systems used for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). <br /><br />The goal of this project is to successfully engage and defeat both single and multiple threat representative targets with performance characteristics significantly improved over current and previous systems.* The program also has the objective of achieving a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 for the system in order to support the Navy's potential consideration of a Program of Record (PoR) milestone decision. The Government seeks balanced approaches in proposals that reflect: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the most advantageous use of existing subsystems and components where appropriate,&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) technical maturation of components or<br />designs, of current and previous systems, that provide significantly enhanced lethality, higher duty cycle, reduced maintenance, improved durability, or lower system cost, and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) a cost effective approach to achieving maturation of technologies, integration of the design, and an at-sea demonstration. The Government will use a three-phased acquisition structure, with an overall 30-month timeline from contract award to project completion with the at-sea testing. This BAA calls for fully integrated system level proposals for the LWSD. Proposals that only address partial solutions or component level&nbsp; technologies will not be considered for award.<br /><br />See&nbsp; full announcement for full description.&nbsp;

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command Technology Applications Contracting Office has a requirement for a follow-on contract for the production of tri-band antennas that support Secure Real Time Video for installation and use on Special Operations Aircraft. This effort includes production of antennas, spares, technical guidance and support, and associated technical data. This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract is expected to begin on 15 February 2015 with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods, ending on or about 14 February 2020.
<p>The Government expects to negotiate and award this requirement on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, to First RF Corporation, 5340 Airport Blvd, Boulder, CO 80301. The antenna covered by this requirement has undergone extensive testing and approval in conjunction with prior competition. To recompete this requirement would cause substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delay. Parties that feel they can meet this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves. While this notice is not a request for competitive proposal, the Government will consider all bids, proposals, quotations, and capability statements received at aaron.b.martin12.civ@mail.mil by the response date specified in this announcement.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey for the Strip Stock Rubber Material  <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br>  <br> 1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br>  <br> 2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br>  <br> 3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br>  <br> 4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> 5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>  <br> 6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as  quote mark Confidential quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br> THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.

<DESC>DO NOT CONTACT POSTER POC, S. SICA.  FOR ANY INFORMATION CONTACT:: Mr. Kenneth Vereb, Electronics Engineer, (443) 395-1205 FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. <br>  <br> This market survey notice is a sources sought for information ONLY, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. NO proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals and NO contract shall be awarded from this survey. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. This is a Market Survey for a contract for Depot and field level Overhauls and Repair (O&R) services, field maintenance support, engineering services, and Software Support Services for the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS), and when necessary if affecting or affected by the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Electronics Counter-Countermeasures Control Subsystem (DECS), DSCS/CDECS, Central Component (CC)/DECS Remote Component (RC); the DECS systems. CECOM Software Engineering Center (SEC) is responsible for providing life cycle software support for Mission Critical Defense Systems (MCDSs). The goals of the SEC are to: 1) establish/maintain Post Production Software Support (PPSS) for fielded systems, and 2) provide software engineering support for systems both deployed and under upgrade. The contractor shall support the PPSS for both the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS) and DSCS /CDECS with the PPSS efforts  In addition this acquisition will also continue to provide resident site support (fault isolation, corrective action, engineering support and testing) through Field Maintenance Technicians (FMTs) for the subject equipments. The FMTs will support site personnel which are required to maintain fielded systems worldwide. No more than 2 manned sites will support various CONUS locations.. The Contractor's Systems Engineering Staff will provide analytical support to the FMTs on-site problems and duplicate and suggest corrective action for system anomalies reported by the FMTs. In addition all Depot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul and redeployment required to correct said anomalies will be accomplished. The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package which would be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems and anomalies, furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes that availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete technical data package) necessary to provide the detailed Depot level and site engineering support for the systems for which this contract is intended. This PPSS support will consist primarily of the correction of software defects/deficiencies/errors, and the implementation of software refinements and enhancements to the operational and support software for these systems.   <br>  <br> Contractor shall provide a CAPABILITIES DOCUMENT which should demonstrate their abilities in handling the engineering support, depot repair support and FMT support  required to support such a legacy system  originall fielded in 1974.  Document should indicate what other systems they have had contracts on and how they handled these issues; especially engineering of legacy systems of over 30 years old.. This contract will establish the requirements for level of effort base contract of one year, with four one year options (2015 plus Options 2016-2019), for the acquisition of PPSS and all other efforts concerning the systems.  A respondent must be able to prove to the Government how Depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings. A written response must include evidence of the respondent's ability to support the described equipment by writing to Mr. Kenneth Vereb at Email: kenneth.m.vereb2.civ@mail.mil, Electronics Engineer, (443) 395-1205 <br>  <br> Commander,  <br> USACECOM, ATTN: AMSRD-RDER-PRA-ED (VEREB),  <br> Building 6007 Room 3 floor 140 Pod 28,  <br> Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005  <br>  <br> For more information contact Mr. Kenneth Vereb, Electronics Engineer, (443) 395-1205.  <br>  <br>

<DESC>Description:
<p><br />1.0 Summary</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Development, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting market research to identify businesses for services to examine the characteristics of drug use among drivers arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) or Driving Under the Influence of Drugs (DUID). The Contractor will collect information-for example, self-report data about over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drug use and biological samples to detect the presence of these drugs-on the day of arrest. The study will take place in two jurisdictions; most likely in separate states. This Sources Sought Notice does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br />&emsp;<br /><br />2.0 Background</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an administration of the U.S. DOT. NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes, through education, research, safety standards and enforcement activity. Under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), Subsection 402(c), the Secretary, acting through the NHTSA Administrator, shall establish a cooperative program to research and evaluate State highway safety countermeasures. NHTSA, in conjunction with the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), has identified several areas for research and evaluation to be conducted under this program. In support of NHTSA, the Volpe Center will assist in establishing and managing this new cooperative program.</p>
<p>Drug-impaired driving is receiving additional focus within federal and state agencies. Impairment not only arises from illegal drugs, but from over-the-counter and prescription medications. The public and industry stakeholders are increasingly asking questions about drugged driving; however, due to the lack of data there is often difficulty in providing answers. NHTSA seeks to learn more about the prevalence of drug use among drivers, which drugs (and how many of them) cause impairment, what type of impairment results, and whether certain drugs increase the risk of drivers being involved in a crash (or a fatal crash), etc. These questions are especially relevant now, as the states of Washington and Colorado have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and other states are considering doing the same.</p>
<p>It is important for NHTSA to know about the drug use of DWI and DUID offenders because:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Impaired-driving offenders who are arrested for alcohol-impaired driving are rarely tested and prosecuted also for drugged driving. Knowing more about the extent to which arrested impaired-driving offenders test positive for alcohol, drugs or both can help better define the extent of the drugged driving problem.<br />&bull;&nbsp; Knowing more about the extent of the drugged driving problem can better inform State and local community decisions about the development, implementation, and evaluation of countermeasures to prevent drugged driving crashes, injuries, and fatalities.<br />&bull;&nbsp; Knowing whether arrested impaired-driving offenders are using drugs, alcohol or alcohol in combination with other drugs, can help pinpoint a jurisdiction's needs for enforcement and treatment. This information may also translate to prevention messages and outreach efforts.</p>
<p>3.0 Description</p>
<p>This research study will collect self-report data about over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drug use, and biological samples to detect the presence of these drugs, on the day of arrest among drivers arrested for DWI and/or DUID.<br />&emsp;<br />The study will examine the characteristics of drivers arrested for DWI and/or DUID, which can lead to information that will better define the problem of drugged driving. It can also inform decisions about the development, implementation, and evaluation of countermeasures to prevent drugged driving crashes, injuries, and fatalities.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for supporting the Government in the following work areas: <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Gather information about and recommend two potential sites for data collection. This Investigation will be in coordination with Volpe, GHSA, NHTSA Regional Offices, and any affected State Highway Safety Offices. <br />2.&nbsp; Develop a plan to obtain data on impaired driving suspects' drug use on the day they were arrested and their drug use characteristics in general. Drug use includes over-the-counter, prescription (including medications that are used inappropriately or illegally), and illegal drugs. It is possible that even though a person is arrested based on alcohol use, the suspect also used other drugs.<br />3.&nbsp; Maintain and protect the confidentiality of all subject data.<br />4.&nbsp; Research "archival" data already being collected by the law enforcement agency and/or the lab the agency uses<br />5.&nbsp; Identify and describe alternate approaches for collecting the data, including a detailed description of the methodology for each approach. <br />6.&nbsp; Collect self-reporting data on offenders' drug and alcohol use. It may be most practical to do this at the time of arrest (for example, at a sobriety checkpoint) or during the booking procedure. (It is possible that this self-reporting and "archival" data may be collected by the arresting officer and/or Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) officer.<br />7.&nbsp; Submit a final report.</p>
<p>In order to perform the above tasks, the Contractor must demonstrate expertise in collecting biological samples on a number of drugs (including prescription and over the counter medications), and alcohol. In addition, the Contractor must take into account Internal Review Board (IRB) procedures and receive IRB approval, as well as follow the requirements set forth in the Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>
<p>4.0 Submission Instructions</p>
<p>Interested Contractors must submit a written Statement of Capabilities of sufficient detail demonstrating their understanding of the Section 3.0 description of requirements (above). Additionally, the Contractor must provide information on relevant experience on projects similar to the one described above (a minimum of three (3) previous or current projects in the past five (5) years). Capability information for the previous or current projects shall include: Contract number; Customer (Government agency, private industry); Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) name, telephone and fax numbers; contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided shall be detailed and shall show technical capabilities, knowledge, and expertise so the Government can assess the ability to provide the described services in each of the above stated work areas.</p>
<p>All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than six (6) pages. Page size is set at 8.5" X 11" and text should be no smaller than 11 point and double-spaced.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by <strong>10:00 am </strong>Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, <strong>Friday, 12 Dec 14. </strong>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The part numbers, descriptions, and quantities required are as follows:</p>
<p>TARGET DETACHABLE COIL 360 NANO 1mm x 2cm</p>
<p>TARGET DETACHABLE COIL 360 NANO 1mm x 3cm</p>

<CONTACT>Michael Maher, Mr., Email DARPA-SN-15-12@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is requesting information on areas of research related to developing materials and processes that would allow for the manufacturing of complex aerospace composite parts at automotive efficiencies.  Innovations in these areas could potentially result in solutions that would significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing aerospace composites and allow them to buy their way onto next generation aircraft and future advanced unmanned aerial vehicles.  In addition to significantly reducing the cost of fabricating small, complex aerospace composite parts, such solutions must maintain performance akin to typical intermediate modulus carbon fiber toughened epoxy systems.  Composite materials are an integral part of several military platforms but individual parts costs are still too high to allow for expanded use of aerospace composites within the Department of Defense (DoD) despite their superior performance (strength to weight ratio) when compared to traditional metals.  Commercially, the automotive industry has optimized the process to build and assemble complex parts that allow for significantly reduced costs associated with manufacturing.  DARPA/DSO is exploring materials and techniques that can be applied to aerospace industry for composite parts to significantly reduce the cost and time to make small composite parts.  DSO anticipates such materials and techniques would be build rate insensitive, less capital intensive when compared to traditional methods, and able to meet emerging aerospace platform requirements.

<DESC>Military Sealift Command- Washington, DC (MSC-DC) intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to a single source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, on or about 02 February 2014 to L-3 Communications Corporation (L-3). The period of performance will include a one (1) year base period plus four (4) one-year option periods. The purpose of this contract is to provide MSC with the services to maintain, troubleshoot, repair, modify, and/or upgrade the Machinery Centralized Controls System (MCCS) aboard USNS SUPPLY class vessels. L-3 developed this system with the use of several of its subsidiaries under a previously awarded and completed contract. Because of this, the expertise for the maintenance of each part of the system lies within one or more subsidiary group of L-3. Given the complexities of the system which was newly installed by L-3 under a previous contract, L-3 is the only company with personnel that are intimately familiar with all aspects of the system design, software coding, and the interfaces to the existing ship's equipment. Further, in some instances, utilizing another company in the performance of this effort would result in potential harm to the Government in terms of voided warranties.
<p>This procurement is a FAR Part 12 acquisition being conducted using FAR Part 15 procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330 with the size standard of $35.5 million. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within 7 calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by MSC. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address lisa.bouchelle@navy.mil. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the lowest price technically acceptable evaluation process, with technical proposals. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1. Price:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2. The lowest priced offeror will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If the offeror meets all criteria the process will end and award will made to that offeror. If the offeror does not meet all criteria the process will move on to next lowest priced offeror and so on until an award is made. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Direct Attack Division, 102 West "D" Avenue, Suite 261, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</span></p>

Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>

<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A. Contracting Information. <br />(1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make an offer which includes individual's name, title, e-mail address and phone number.<br />(2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). <br />(3) Organizational Representatives.

Certification shall be in accordance with Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) (v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph ii above.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Renewal and purchase of new Universal Imaging Utility Software Licenses.</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR PART 13.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78.</p>
<p>1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)<br /><br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to Judith.hicklin@nist.gov. Questions should be received no later December 17, 2014. Any responses to questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation. Even if provided in other form, only the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519 with a small business size standard of 150 employees. <br /><strong>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. This solicitation is for a renewal of Universal Imaging Utility (UIU) software licenses. Only proposals from authorized resellers will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br /></strong>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price Offeror meeting technical acceptability requirements. This is a brand-name requirement and substitute products will not be considered.</p>
<p><strong>DUE DATE FOR QUOTES</strong><br />***The due date and time for receipt of quotations is December 17, 2014 no later than 12:00PM EST. The offeror shall hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>Quotations must be received at judith.hicklin@nist.gov before the due date and time specified in the solicitation. Facsimile quotations will not be accepted. Only information received on or before the due date and time shall be considered for award. Any quotation, or part thereof, received after the due date and time, shall be deemed late and not considered for award. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span></strong>&nbsp;<br />The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) Desktop Support Team at NIST (Gaithersburg &amp; Boulder) installs 1,500 new Windows based computers at NIST annually and provides maintenance to 3,000 Windows based computers that were installed with the Univeral Imaging Utility. This requires the Universal Imaging Utility (UIU) software to reduce the overall number of images that must be created and maintained in order to install these systems. This request is to renew 3,000 Universal Imaging Utility (UIU) software licenses and purchase 1,500 new licenses.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brand Name Justification:<br /></span></strong><br />There is no other software tool available that provides this capability for Windows based computer systems. With the UIU software NIST has reduced the number of Windows images from twenty-eight standard images to three standard images. It also enables the Desktop Support Team to maintain only 1 image per Custom OU Image instead of many images per Custom OUT Image. Without the UIU software NIST would incur substantial additional labor and material (data storage) costs. The required UIU software licenses are available through authorized resellers and business partners.</p>
<p><br />Offerors shall provide firm-fixed-pricing for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001:<br />Description: The Contractor shall provide Universal Imaging Utility Software Licenses (Renewal)<br />Part# UIUGM2000<br />Period of Performance: 1/1/2015 - 12/31/2015<br />Quantity: 3,000</p>

<p>(b) Invoice Submission.  The contractor shall submit invoices in an original and one copy to the office identified in Block 21 (i.e. U.S. Department of State, 4000 North Andrews Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309., via e-mail at GoodwineLC@state.gov and RushLE@state.gov .

<p>(c) Contractor Remittance Address.  The Government will make payment to the contractor's bank and account included in SAM.</p>
<p>9. EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS</p>
<p>9.1. The Government intends to make an award based on the initial quotations. If further questions are required, the contracting officer may contact the offeror or offerors. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and also provides the best value to the Government. Best value to the Government will be determined on a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) basis. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>9.1. 1. Non-Price Factors</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Products: Contractor proposes the brand name products detailed in Section 2 or "equal" products meeting the requirements of FAR 52.211-6.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Delivery within 30 days of receipt of order</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate for acceptability, but will not rank the quotations by the non-price factors. The Government will evaluate the quotations on an acceptable or unacceptable basis, assigning one of the ratings described below.</p>
<p>Acceptable	Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable	Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>Any factor evaluated as "Unacceptable" will render the entire quotation unacceptable and, therefore, unawardable.  Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award.</p>
<p>9.1.2. Price</p>
<p>Price will be determined based on the pricing template contained in Section 2. An evaluation factor may also be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(VIII) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items (APR 2014), applies to this acquisition.  In addition to written price quotes, offerors are instructed to provide existing product literature or other documents as stated in paragraph (4) and past performance references as stated in paragraph (10) of the referenced clause.
(IX) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014), applies to this acquisition.
(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  The following technical factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in descending order of importance. 
Factor 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:  Sellers shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years.  Each reference shall include: the number and email addresses.  References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's quotation.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offeror's quotation may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offeror's quotation to the extent appropriate.   Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.  All past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.
Factor 2 - QUALITY OF DATA:  The digital data shall be of such quality as to allow the USGS interpreters the ability to distinguish key geologic features.  Data must be of sufficient resolution to allow interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow).  If the quality of the processed data are not of sufficient quality to allow for the interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow), the USGS will request access to the raw unprocessed field data in order to re-process the data with better results.  The contractor offering seismic data with the highest CMP fold will be considered as a great value.
(b)	 Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
PROPOSAL PREPARATION
The vendor is cautioned to study the Evaluation Factors stated above along with their relative importance.  Your proposal package must address each of these factors since these are the standards against which your proposal shall be evaluated.  It is the vendors responsibility to include the appropriate documentation in its quotation package to allow a complete technical/price evaluation.  Failure to submit the appropriate documentation may result in the rejection of the vendors quotation.  Any licensing agreements that are proposed to be applicable for the purchase of data under this procurement shall be provided with the proposal.
Note the requirements for System for Award Management (SAM) registration and completion of the On-line Representations and Certifications as contained in the terms and conditions section.
QUANTITY
After reviewing the quality of available data, the USGS will have the option whether or not to purchase data from the areas described in Attachment 1 - Description of Data.:
AWARD
The award of this requirement shall be made using only the procedures found in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13.  Award shall be made to that vendor whose proposal, conforming to this RFP, is determined to be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed above.  In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be significantly more important than evaluated price or cost.  Price or cost will become the determining factor between proposals judged to be essentially equal in technical merit. The Government may award a single or multiple contracts as a result of the evaluation of proposals.  The Government anticipates an IDIQ type contract with individual task orders issued under multiple awards which may be made as a result of this solicitation.
(X) The offeror shall submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Dec 2012), with its quote.  An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM .  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the SAM website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance on rail information technology (IT) integration and development in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Project Background and Description of Grantee</span></p>
<p>Kazakhstan Temir Zholy Joint Stock Company ("KTZ") is the state-owned rail company of Kazakhstan.  The purpose of the KTZ Rail Information Technology Integration and Development Technical Assistance ("TA") is to conduct a comprehensive review of KTZ's current IT and management information systems and, in light of what is currently available to advance railways, recommend system improvements or additions.  This analysis will provide an overview of all of the IT and information systems in place and options for modernization.  The TA will provide a gap analysis and recommendations for deployment of IT systems.  In addition, the TA contractor will conduct workshops in order to familiarize KTZ personnel with the types of software, their functionality and benefits.  Using the results of the gap analysis and the workshops, the TA will develop a financial analysis for the IT systems (including looking at the financial impact of operational efficiencies) and an implementation and integration plan.  This implementation and integration plan will enable KTZ to consolidate its information systems and make investments to modernize and take advantage of its functional grouping into three new departments.  The TA will also develop specifications for information technology and management systems for KTZ, refining the recommendations.  In addition, the TA will design a future training and technology transfer program that would enhance KTZ's familiarity with such systems and the full range of benefits they can provide, through &lsquo;hands on' experience for its employees.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Description of Study Components</span></p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $437,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<p>52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (IAW FAR 12.301(b)(1)) (APR 2014): Paragraph (b), entitled "Submission of Offers": <br />(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate volumes; Volume 1 - Cost/Price Proposal and Volume 2 - Technical Proposal (Maximum of 30 pages). Offerors are not required to provide past performance information.<br />52.212-2: EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. Proposals will be evaluated on lowest price technically acceptable basis. Award will be conducted under the provisions of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, and FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Submit only written offers; oral offers will not be accepted. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES<br />A. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures, to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. Tradeoffs will not be permitted. Award will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements and is judged, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government. The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).</p>
<p>While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO BE AWARDED <br />The Government intends to select one contractor for this acquisition. However, the Government reserves the right not to award a contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>C. REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract or price terms and conditions, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>D. CORRECTION POTENTIAL OF PROPOSALS<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an Offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>E. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />1. Factors:<br />Factor 1 - Cost/Price</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical<br />Subfactor 1 - Security Management<br />Subfactor 2 - Program Management<br />Subfactor 3 - Technical Expertise</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors herein. <br />2. Order of Importance:<br />In LPTA, Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. <br />3. Evaluation Methodology:</p>
<p>Proposals will be first evaluated by price and then evaluated for technical acceptance. Once the offers are ranked by TEP, they will then be evaluated for technical acceptability from lowest price to highest price until a technically acceptable offer is found. When the offer with the lowest price is deemed technically acceptable, no further technical evaluations will be conducted for any of the remaining offers. Technical evaluations shall be evaluated as set forth in paragraph 5 below, with a determination of Acceptable or Unacceptable. <br />4. Factor 1 - Cost/Price:</p>
<p>(1) Total Evaluated Price (TEP)<br />The offeror's Price Volume will be evaluated for award purposes based upon the total anticipated contract value. The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated as the sum of the Firm-Fixed-Price sub-CLINs under CLINs 0001-0003, and the sum of the sub-CLINs under CLIN 0002, "over and above" shall be evaluated for balance and reasonableness by comparing against commercial market rates and or wage determination rates. The TEP will be provided to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for consideration in the best value decision.</p>
<p>(2) Price Reasonableness<br />An offeror's Price Volume will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable. A price is reasonable when it provides best value to the Government when consideration is given to the current market prices, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror and risk. IAW FAR 15.403-1(b), the Government may require submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to evaluate price criteria for reasonableness. When adequate price competition exists, generally no additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
<p>(3) Unbalanced CLIN Prices<br />Price analysis and evaluation of the information in the Price Volume will be used to determine if the prices for the proposed contract line items are balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total solicitation effort price, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line items appears to be significantly over or under-stated. Unbalanced pricing may result in an offer being rejected if the Government determines that it presents an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>F. TRADEOFFS<br />Tradeoffs are not permitted in LPTA procedures.</p>
<p>G. DISCUSSIONS<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, they will be held in written format.</p>
<p>H. SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as complete terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide accompanying rationale.<br />5. Factor 2 - Technical:<br />Each subfactor within the technical factor will receive one of the ratings described below based on the criteria listed below. Individual subfactor ratings will be used to determine the overall technical acceptability of each proposal. To be technically acceptable at the factor level, the Offeror must be rated acceptable in each subfactor. A final unacceptable subfactor assessment will determine an overall technical unacceptable rating.</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an Unacceptable rating are not awardable.<br /><br /><br />Subfactor 1: Security Management<br />The Government will assess the Offeror's proposed Security Management approach. The subfactor threshold (minimum) is met when the Offeror's proposal demonstrates details and development of the processes on all of the following essential components and is supported by the inclusion of previous contract experience in these areas:</p>
<p>a. SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS: (PWS ref: 4.1, 4.2) The offer demonstrates a clear understanding of the security clearance process to ensure contractor personnel have the applicable clearances to accomplish the Base-Wide Network, Web and PC Support Services mission IAW DoD 5220.22-M "National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual" (NISPOM), AFI 31-501, "Personnel Security Program Management", and AFI 31-601, "Industrial Security Program Management".</p>
<p>b.

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The specification calls for availabilty to fit a 7 to 12" mattress.. <BR> <BR>My question is, does our company have to have at least 500 employees or does that mean up to 500 employees?  This means if you have 500 employees or less you are a small business when you are considering bidding on this NAICS code classification <BR> <BR>Is it a requirement for the encasements to be manufactured in the U.S. or a Trade Agreement Act countries acceptable?A trade agreement country is acceptable. <BR> <BR>Does buyer just want the "Mattress" protector or also the "Box Spring" protector? The reason we ask is because the dimensions specified by buyer of 38"x80"x9" is for the combination set for BOTH the mattress AND box spring set. The Protect a Bed "BUG PROTECTION" Cover for the "TWIN XL" MATTRESS ONLY has dimensions of 38"x80"x8.5". Thank you Interested SDVOSB seller:  Mattress only please <BR> <BR>product provided needs to meet Trade Agreement/Buy American Act compliant <BR> <BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS</p>
<p>Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of <br />personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) notice for Sustainability/Logistics Basing Science and Technology Objective - Demonstration (SLB-STO-D) Industry Assessment and Demonstration. NSRDEC will conduct an Industry Assessment of Commercial technologies in September 2015.  This assessment will be based on emerging technologies that reduce sustainment requirements for small contingency base operation. The implementation of the technologies under consideration will lead to a reduction in the delivery of water and fuel to base camps, while lessening the burden of waste collection, management, and disposal.    <br>      <br>   Submission instructions and specific details on technologies of interest are at Attachment 1 and should be thoroughly reviewed before responding to this RFI.  An RFI Submission Form is at Attachment 2 and must also be submitted with your response.   <br>      <br>   The SLB STO-D team will review all documents submitted in response to this RFI and will select candidate technologies based on their relevance and technology readiness level to reduce sustainment requirements for small contingency basing.  Companies with candidate technologies of interest will be invited to participate in the Industry Assessment and Demonstration event.   <br>      <br>   The due date for responses to this RFI is midnight EST on 16 Jan 2015.   <br>      <br>   ABOUT SLB STO-D:  In February 2012, the Department of the Army approved SLB STO-D, a 6-year major science and technology (S&T) program to demonstrate integrated solutions for improving the management of fuel, water, and waste at expeditionary base camps. The program objective is to reduce the need for fuel resupply by 25%, water resupply by 75% and decrease waste by 50%, while optimizing quality of life options at contingency bases ranging in size from 50-1000 PAX (personnel). The focus of the program is the following problem statement:  quote mark The Army needs improved capability to enable sustainment independence/self-sufficiency and to reduce sustainment demands at expeditionary basing level contingency bases. It is too costly, too unpredictable, and too labor intensive for a Small Unit to carry all required consumables to last for weeks or months at a Combat Outpost/Patrol Base (COP/PB).  Storage facilities and systems do not meet needs of these small bases, and resupply efforts are highly unpredictable. quote mark   To put the problem in perspective, in 2011 contingency bases (all Services) consumed approximately 254,000,000 gallons of fuel, which is equal to that of ground and air platforms combined (according to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs (ASD, OEPP)). At a conservative fully burdened cost of fuel of $10 per gallon, this represents a significant cost of $2.54B. Even more significant is the risk to Soldiers who conduct tactical resupply to these bases on ground vehicle convoys. Industry Assessment Concept: SLB STO-D has adopted an incremental demonstration concept to accommodate a large number of currently funded, Army RDECOM Science &Technology (S&T) projects. These projects will feed into multiple demonstrations having independent schedules and technology maturation paths. The incremental approach provides the opportunity to move early successes to the appropriate transition path as soon as possible. The SLB STO-D demonstration concept also includes an Industry Assessment to ensure capability gaps are met and innovative technologies are identified from industry (in addition to government-sponsored programs). This RFI seeks candidate technologies specifically for the SLB STO-D Industry Assessment. SLB STO-D will coordinate an initial, user-based Industry Assessment of selected technologies followed by a brief demonstration. The assessment will assist in the identification of mature, desirable systems while the demonstration will provide an opportunity to highlight technology benefits to interested technology transition partners. Formal transition partners include: Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PdM FSS), Project Manager Expeditionary Energy and Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) and Product Manager Petroleum and Water Systems (PdM PAWS). Representatives from our transition partners will be on-site during the Industry Assessment. Additionally, as mentioned above, the planned assessment will focus on specific areas for fuel, water and generated waste reduction technologies outlined further in this document. Industry will be invited to demonstrate technology capabilities in addressing these areas. Knowledge gained as a result of this assessment may be used to refine inputs for on-going base camp modeling efforts.   <br>      <br>   SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:  To respond to this RFI, please review Attachment 1 Topic Areas and White Paper Instructions, prepare a white paper NOT TO EXCEED 3 PAGES, and complete the attached SLB STO-D Submission Form, and provide additional pertinent information.     <br>      <br>   Send submissions and white papers via e-mail to:    <br>   benjamin.j.campbell26.civ@mail.mil and elizabeth.d.swisher.civ@mail.mil    <br>      <br>   Please do not attach marketing brochures, test reports, or other extraneous materials to your Submission Form as they will not be reviewed.    <br>      <br>   The due date for responses to this RFI is midnight EST on 16 Jan 2015.   <br>       <br>   If your technology is of interest, the SLB STO-D Team will contact you with an invitation to participate in the Industry Assessment that will occur at Contingency Basing Integration and Technology Evaluation Center (CBITEC), Ft. Leonard Wood, in September 2015.   <br>      <br>   All companies will be notified of invitation/non-invitation decisions by late-February 2015.   <br>      <br>   Additional details regarding the Industry Assessment will be provided to invited candidates at an Information Session held in March, 2015.   <br>       <br>   IMPORTANT NOTICE: This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.<br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires a contract to provide the Epidemiology branch in the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention with data collection, analysis and other project management activities associated with the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS), a large ongoing epidemiologic study related to the diagnosis, care and treatment of persons infected with HIV disease in the United States.<br /><br />Since 1993, the HOPS has been a unique source of longitudinal epidemiologic data about the health of HIV-infected persons in the United States. HOPS collects medical records abstraction data from nine HIV clinic sites located in Denver CO, Washington DC, Tampa FL, Chicago IL, Philadelphia PA, and Suffolk County NY. The HOPS database currently contains over 10,000 patients and over 800 variables. Due to its size and scope, HOPS is nationally recognized for its longevity, and the breadth and depth of its clinical chart abstraction. The HOPS allows for the examination of trends in the epidemiology of chronic HIV disease in this aging population; the identification of association and interactions between HIV disease, antiretroviral therapy, and other comorbidities. HOPS data are also being used to monitor the progress in achieving the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This requires continuous, consistent, quality data collection from the aforementioned study sites and subsets of patients for this ongoing longitudinal study. The anticipated period of performance is September 30, 2015 through September 29, 2020. The&nbsp;services are&nbsp;currently performed under Contract HHSD200201141872D with Cerner Corporation.
<p>In order for us to know if the capacity at your company or organization may be suitable for administering one or more aspects of this large scale project, please provide answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What is your capability in public health or medical research projects addressing HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in the United States? If applicable, please provide the following information for each specific project (contract number, client, duration, dollar value and description).</p>
<p>2. What is your capability and expertise in the collection and management of multi-site longitudinal data from physician-patient interactions including data on demographics, social-behavioral characteristics, symptoms, medical diagnoses, treatments and laboratory values? If applicable, please provide specific examples of previous projects that reflect your experience (project name, description, agency/organization, and duration).</p>
<p>3. What is your capability and expertise in the analysis of multi-site longitudinal data from physician-patient interactions including but not limited to demographics, social-behavioral characteristics, symptoms, medical diagnoses, treatments and laboratory values? If applicable, please provide citations for peer-reviewed research articles based on analyses you performed. Provide citations for any public health or medical conferences or meetings at which the analyses were part of a poster or oral presentation.</p>
<p>4. As described above, the HOPS is a longitudinal study of over twenty years in duration with over 10,000 patients and 800 variables. Previously collected chart abstracted data need to be seamlessly combined with newly collected data for the same patients for analyses. What is your capability in maintaining continuous collection of the data to ensure comparability and scientific validity?

The contractor shall focus on the final performance years and close-out of the HITECH program. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background:<br /></strong></span>Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) amends Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) by establishing incentive payments for EPs and EHs to promote the adoption and meaningful use of Health Information Technology (HIT) and qualified Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The expanded use of HIT and EHRs is considered essential in order to significantly improve both the quality and value of American health care. Collectively, these provisions, together with Title XIII of Division A of ARRA, are termed the HITECH Act.<br /><br />The incentive payments are part of a broader effort under the HITECH Act to accelerate the adoption of HIT and the utilization of qualified EHRs; importantly, the incentive programs outlined in Division B Title IV of the HITECH Act are considered to be the keys to inducing providers to actively utilize HIT. EPs and EHs are eligible for the EHR incentive payments if, among other requirements, they &ldquo;meaningfully use&rdquo; certified EHR technology. Meaningful use is a term defined by CMS that describes and helps measure the use of HIT in order to further the goals of information exchange among health care professionals.<br /><br />The provider registration and verification of eligibility for HITECH incentive payments is managed through the NLR; the NLR is hosted at a CMS Enterprise Data Center (EDC). The NLR is the designated system of records for the HITECH initiative that contains all provider registration/attestation documentation, banking information for each recipient, calculates the recipient payments amounts, verifies meaningful use, checks for duplicate payments, and maintains the incentive payment history files.<br /><br />The Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and various Medicare systems will interface with the NLR to provide information related to allowed charges, EH payment amounts, the recipient name, National Provider Identifier (NPI)/CMS Certification Number (CCN)/Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and banking/payment details for each recipient [account/routing numbers for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) deposits and an address for paper checks]. The NLR will compile a single file from these data with complete payment information on all eligible recipients for each monthly payment cycle in an agreed upon format that the PFDC will receive from the NLR. The PFDC will develop two separate files from this NLR file: 1) the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) standard payment file that shall be sent to the Medicare bank for processing EFT payments; and 2) a positive pay paper check payment file that the PFDC shall use to disburse paper checks. CMS is reserving the right to require the PFDC to issue paper check payments to providers that do not receive their HITECH payments through EFT deposits.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose:<br /></span></strong>The purpose of this pending effort is to assist CMS in disbursing EHR incentive payments to eligible Medicare professionals (EPs) and eligible hospitals (EHs) under the HITECH Act. The contract will focus on the final performance years and close-out of the HITECH program; the tasks include: making payments to EPs and EHs, closing out accounts, processing meaningful use audit and cost report audit demand letters, collecting and reporting on receivables, debt referrals to the US Treasury, processing and handling Remedy tickets, managing/monitoring extended repayment plans, making manual payments and manual adjustments to payments, and working with all associated stakeholders in helping to finish the HITECH program. The PFDC also ensures proper oversight of funds control and accounting related to these payments, recoveries and communications, as well as participating in the annual Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Audit and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A123 Audit. <br /><br />See attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) for further information.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements for Submitting Responses to this Sources Sought Notice:<br /></span></strong>In order for CMS to evaluate a firm's capability, Capability Statements shall be submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice and shall include written responses demonstrating knowledge and experience to perform the Tasks included in the SOW.

<p>2.0 BACKGROUND<br />___________________________________</p>
<p>TRICARE Online (TOL) Project</p>
<p>TOL increases access to care for the beneficiary, optimizes the provision of care by the provider, and assists in population health management while optimizing the business management of the MHS. TOL provides the 9.6 million DoD beneficiaries, as well as providers and managers with a single, efficient, cost-effective, user-friendly, network-centric platform that enhances the access to the delivery of health care from any location, at any time. The vehicle, or strategic enabler, to achieve these goals is a common, MHS-wide Internet portal focused on providing patient centric services.</p>
<p>TOL is focused on shore-based facilities, although accessible to ships/locations that have Internet connectivity. It reduces the redundancy of individual Service and Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) efforts and optimizes the beneficiary's ease of navigation through the MHS. TOL is designed using open architectural standards using existing Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and currently available commercial infrastructure.</p>

SYNOPSIS:   <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) is conducting market research for live training requirements anticipated for the Range Instrumentation Lifecycle Management (RILM) effort. This includes: the study, design, development, testing, qualification, production, integration, training, fielding and interim sustainment support to maintain relevancy of fielded training systems.  This Request for Information seeks market information on businesses' approach to the requirements described in the below sections.    <br>    <br>  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code has not been determined at this time. Once it is identified, this announcement will be amended.  <br>    <br>  Overview:  PEO STRI, PM TRADE, Product Manager Digitized Training (PM DT) anticipates numerous live training requirements for the study, analysis, design, development, installation, testing, materiel procurement, integration, training, fielding, and Life Cycle Management support of various training systems.  RILM will support the full range of live training requirements from individual training to collective training at unit home stations, Combat Training Centers (CTCs) Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) - Instrumentation System (IS), and other training ranges throughout the world.    <br>    <br>  Covered Systems: The Range Instrumentation Lifecycle Management (RILM) effort will encompass life cycle support associated with the following Programs.  <br>    <br>  a) Digital Range Training Systems (DRTS)  <br>    <br>     1) Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complex (DMPRC)  <br>     2) Digital Multi-Purpose Training Ranges (DMPTR)  <br>     3) Battle Area Complex (BAX)  <br>     4) Digital Air/Ground Integration Range (DAGIR)   <br>     5) Aerial Gunnery Range (AGR)  <br>     6) DRTS Scalable Ranges (variations of the above listed ranges)  <br>    <br>  b) Integrated MOUT Training Systems (IMTS)  <br>    <br>     1) Combined Arms Collective Training Facilities (CACTFs) and Collective Training Facilities (CTFs)  <br>     2) Shoot Houses (SHs) and Automated Shoot Houses (ASHs)  <br>     3) Urban Assault Courses (UACs)  <br>    <br>  c) Targetry Range Automated Control and Recording (TRACR)  <br>    <br>     1) Scout/Recce Range   <br>     2) Small arms ranges  <br>     3) Known Distance (KD) ranges  <br>     4) Infantry Platoon Battle Courses  (IPBCs )  <br>     5) Location of Miss And Hit (LOMAH)  <br>     6) Other TRACR ranges  <br>    <br>  d) Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS) Exportable Training Capability - Instrumentation System (ECT-IS)  <br>    <br>  e) Combat Training Centers (CTCs) MOUT-IS  <br>    <br>  Requirements. The Government is seeking innovative approaches to Life Cycle support, sustainment, technology upgrades, obsolescence management, and improvements of training systems.  Your approach may include innovations in processes, components, software, hardware, Commercial-Off-The Shelf products, network communications, advanced technology, and other methods to improve the system life cycle, reliability/availability, technical capability and training relevance.  The objective is to employ a consolidated streamlined approach that leverages the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Product Line investment, continues the evolution of the Live Training product line, core assets, architectural frameworks, while continuing to provide an efficient, effective, and agile method to accomplish development, integration, testing, Configuration Management (CM), maintenance, and total life-cycle cost reduction for fielded and future training devices. The basic types of efforts expected under RILM are described below.  This list may be expanded if the RILM effort proceeds through the acquisition process.  <br>    <br>  a) Planning: The contractor will be required to develop/ update Life Cycle Support plans.  The plan must include Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality (FMECA), obsolescence management, and Reliability Growth analysis for each major or critical subsystem.  It must consider the coupling among the requirements, design and product support strategy and ensure that the supportability analysis results in an affordable design and product support package.  The planning process must result in an executable plan to maintain system operational status.    <br>    <br>  b) Analysis: The contractor must be able to analyze current system conditions and develop cost effective solutions which extend the system lifetime expectancy or increase specific system capabilities. The analysis will identify Courses Of Action (COAs) with a description of the pros, cons, and risk for each COA.  This analysis may address evolutionary changes to the identified system(s) based on Changes to the Capability Production Document (CPD).    <br>    <br>  c) Obsolescence:  The contractor will identify replacement equipment for obsolete equipment which may or has failed.    <br>    <br>  d) Design: Design efforts may be required as a result of support planning and analysis to develop a solution which maintains or increases system capabilities or based on changes to system(s) requirements.  <br>    <br>  e) Procurement: The contractor will potentially procure replacement hardware for all systems identified in paragraph 2.1 above.   <br>    <br>  f) Integration: The contractor may also be required to install hardware and/or software procured or provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or Government Furnished Information (GFI) into legacy training systems.  As legacy equipment is replaced, the contractor will be required to integrate new equipment and/ or software into various training systems without reducing system availability.    <br>    <br>  g) Test: Legacy systems will be fully tested following integration of any hardware or software, system upgrade, or changes.   <br>    <br>  h) Upgrades:  The contractor will be expected to perform upgrades to the existing training systems.  These upgrades will range from a simple sub-component replacement to a significant system modification involving both hardware and software control and target systems.  <br>    <br>  i) Documentation: The contractor will be required to provide cost, schedule, and performance documentation as required by the Government and identified in the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs).  <br>    <br>  j) Configuration management:  The contract will support the PM TRADE Live Training Transformation (LT2) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) process.  <br>    <br>  k) Training: The contractor will be required to provide operator and maintenance training on all systems upgrades and modifications.  <br>    <br>  l) Support: The contractor may be required to provide interim contractor support for defined periods following completion of site upgrades or modifications.  <br>    <br>  m) Program Management:  The contractor will be expected to provide the required program, financial, technical, and logistical management oversight as required on the individual contracted efforts.  <br>    <br>  n) Information Assurance (IA): The contractor will perform all functions necessary to maintain the existing IA certification through any system modifications or upgrades.   <br>    <br>  All RILM efforts are expected to utilize Government Furnished Information (GFI) software when available from the Army's Live Training Transformation (LT2) for all sites being upgraded or modified.  This requirement expects an approach to leveraging the LT2 software components, maximizing reuse, and optimizing the implementation of standards. https://www.lt2portal.org/   <br>    <br>  II.

<DESC>The C-44 Reservoir/STA Project, Contract No. 2, Martin County Florida  project includes a Base Bid with Options for soil cement (In place) - utilizing off-site aggregate. <br>  <br> The work includes an above-ground reservoir, discharge canal, and associated structures to capture water from the C-44 Basin. Specific project components include the following items and incidental related work: <br>  <br> The remaining portion of the Project Access Road from the termination of the portions of the road built by others. <br>  <br> A reservoir (D-400) comprised of approximately 50,000 linear feet of earthen embankment with a soil cement crest surface and soil cement facing on the interior embankment face. Additional embankment components include an internal inclined sand chimney drain and horizontal blanket drain with pipes running parallel to the embankment with discharge points draining to a swale, and a 3-feet wide trench drain of sand and drain pipes running parallel to the downstream toe of the embankment. The approximately 3,400 acre reservoir has a normal full storage level of 15 feet (EL 41 feet NAVD88) and provides approximately 50,600 acre-feet of storage capacity. <br>  <br> A reservoir discharge tower structure (S-402) comprised of three (3) 7 feet by 7 feet slide gates to convey a maximum of 1,100 cubic feet per Second (cfs) (600 cfs under normal operations) through two 7 feet by 7 feet cast-in-place box culverts (with operable slide gates) to the system discharge canal. The structure also includes a service spillway capable of conveying 810 cfs for emergency discharges and a 50 cfs low reservoir stage withdrawal pump. <br>  <br> The Western Reservoir Perimeter Canal (WRPC) (C-400W) is approximately 35,000 linear feet in length, paralleling most of the northern, western, and southern extent of the reservoir embankment. The WRPC maintains a bottom width of 5 feet for a majority of the canal with a transition from 5 feet to 25 feet along the south side of the reservoir. The canal bottom is constant at EL 12.0 foot NAVD88 for the majority of the canal. The canal includes a 1.5 ft thick sand filter below normal water level along the side slopes and bottom of the canal. The WRPC will be used to transmit surface runoff, seepage flow from the embankment internal drain and the trench drain systems. <br>  <br> WRPC spillway (S-403) is a 50 foot wide spillway which discharges to the intake canal with a crest elevation of 18 feet NAVD88 and a 1,100 cfs capacity. <br> The Eastern Reservoir Perimeter canal (ERPC) (C-400E) approximately 15,000 linear feet in length paralleling the eastern embankment of the reservoir.  The canal maintains a bottom width of 5 feet at an elevation of 12 feet NAVD88. The canal includes a 1.5 ft thick sand filter below normal water level along the side slopes and bottom of the canal. The ERPC is designed to convey runoff and seepage from the embankment internal drain and the trench drain system. The termination of the ERPC includes a drop-inlet drainage structure (S-419) to convey water from the ERPC to the Intake Canal. <br>  <br> The discharge canal conveys flows from the reservoir through the Distribution Canal (C-401N and C-401S) to the Eastern Storm Treatment Area (STA) Collection Canal (C-402E); note; only a portion of this canal will be built as part of this contract, which will be connected to a portion being constructed by others. The canal maintains a bottom width of 10 feet, a bottom elevation of 18.5 feet NAVD88, and a normal operating elevation of 28-29 feet NAVD88 with a design conveyance capacity of 1,100 cfs. One side of the Distribution Canal includes STA berms on one side; this berm will be built by others and the canal constructed under this contract will tie into those previously constructed slopes. The Distribution canal is approximately 20,000 feet in length. <br>  <br> The installation of buried conduits for permanent power for the reservoir discharge structure, connecting to conduit being placed by others. <br>  <br> The installation of several cast-in-place box culverts (S-420A, S-420B) in various locations around project footprint to provide vehicular access across canals. Additionally, the reservoir embankment includes the construction of several boat ramps for access to the reservoir interior. <br>  <br> The installation of embankment piezometers and associated conduit and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) to transmit data back to the future pump station, as well as several groundwater monitoring wells to do the same. The embankment crest includes the installation of settlement plates for long-term settlement monitoring.   <br>  <br> PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Proposals will be evaluated on Technical Merit, Past Performance, Small Business Participation and Price.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Use of Quick City Courier DBA Billings Group Inc. for Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System's (NWIHCS) courier needs is required due to unusual and compelling urgency.  The current NWIHCS courier contract will expire on November 30, 2014, and is currently performed by Quick City Courier DBA Billings Group Inc..  NWIHCS cannot meet its mission without courier services for the following reasons: 1.  Time and temperature sensitive patient vitals are transported from NWIHCS Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) to the parent facility (Omaha Site) for immediate analysis to assist in patient diagnosis.  2.  Used instruments are sent from CBOCs to the Omaha parent facility to be cleaned/re-sterilized and then returned to the CBOCs for use.  3.  Medical Supplies, office supplies, DME/prosthetics, C-files (Compensation and Pension files), mail, medical records, cashier transfers, compact discs, radiology films, and other medical/business items are transported between the parent Omaha site and its CBOCs.   

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
Only  the current vendor performing courier services for NWIHCS is able to perform the needed NWIHCS courier needs beginning December 1 ,2014 with such short notice, due to the following criteria:  route knowledge/ability, badging, etc.   

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: Contracting Officer will determine price fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Pursuant to FAR Part 10 market research was performed to obtain an Independent Government Estimate and famework (timelines) of needed additional NWIHCS courier services, based on input from the current vendor performing NWIHCS courier services.  Research to determine if NWIHCS permanent staff could meet/perform the needed courier services of NWIHCS via government vehicles was conducted, and it was determined as not feesable.    

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Quick City Courier DBA Billings Group Inc.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The purpose of this 6 month PO is so we have enough time to solicite this on EBuy for a FSS Contract as a 100% small business set-aside.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>&nbsp; Task order will provide Physical Access Control Services, software engineering and project coordination support to multiple PBS Security Projects at the McCormack, JFK, and O'Neill Federal Buildings in Boston, MA and the Murphy Federal Building in Waltham, MA. These support services require the existing XTEC Authentx Physical Access Control System components and infrastructure to be modified both in the software logic and physical components to continue to provide secure access to the buildings for PBS due to phased construction projects by PBS. The modified equipment and infrastructure to be maintained and operated by XTEC must provide maximum security during these projects and project coordination of the PBS newly installed security equipment (barriers and gate arms along with infrastructure) to be integrated with the Authentx equipment and components for controlling of new equipment for secure access into the respective buildings. The O'Neill Federal Building new front entrance security pavilion project will require detailed card reader removal and temporary installation as well as new installation of new equipment to support new pavilion equipment. The Murphy Federal Building project in Waltham due to a front entrance security project requires a single card reader to be controlled by the Authentx Global Physical Access Control System and SaaS servers currently deployed for control by the Region. Physical Access Control Services and project coordination are integral to the successful deployment and integration of the PBS security equipment (barriers and gate arms and infrastructure) at these Level 4 buildings and the resulting continued operations of the Authentx PACS equipment during these projects.
