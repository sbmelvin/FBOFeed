The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors. The design, fabrication, installation, performance and acceptance for a complete Mechanical Rubber Denuding Machine Cell to be performed under the firm fixed price contract will consist of the following requirements: 3.1 - General Requirements. A complete turnkey machine cell shall be provided. Turnkey is defined as a project that is designed, built, programmed, installed and tested by the contractor such that it is fully operational to perform mechanical denuding as stated in this specification. The Roadwheel Mechanical Denuding Machine Cell shall consist of a primary machine tool used to remove rubber from new and used roadwheels, a secondary machine to remove remaining rubber, adhesive and residue from the roadwheel surface, robotic material handling, and all required peripheral equipment in order to mechanically remove rubber and bonding agent (adhesive) from used roadwheels. The Mechanical Roadwheel Denuding Machine Cell shall consist of all components necessary to automatically handle and denude roadwheels within an industrial production environment and process the various sizes of roadwheels. Processes such as cryogenics or chemical solutions are not acceptable means of denuding roadwheels. The roadwheels are constructed of aluminum, steel or a combination of aluminum with steel wear rings. All the roadwheels contain tire material which is bonded to the metal around the periphery of the roadwheel. The tire material consists of natural rubber compounds. The removed rubber material shall be handled in such a manner as to cause no hazardous condition to personnel, equipment or the environment.<br>3.2-Major Components. The following list of major components for the Roadwheel Mechanical Denuding Machine Cell is general in nature and in no way limits the contractor in the submittal of alternate concepts or designs. The component list is intended to convey the government's concept of the machine cell based upon experience and historical information of the denuding process. Following is a list of major components of the conceptual machine cell.<br>3.2.1-Primary Denuding Machine.<br>3.2.2-Secondary Denuding Machine.<br>3.2.3-Human Machine Interface (HMI).<br>3.2.4-Robot Material Handler.<br>3.2.5-Conveyor & Pallet Station.<br>3.2.6-Machine Cell Safety Barrier.<br>3.2.7-Scrap Rubber Collection System.<br>3.2.8-Fume, Smoke, Particulate Abatement Equipment.<br>3.2.9-Peripheral Equipment.<br>3.3-Government Furnished Property.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>1.  BASIS OF AWARD<br>a.   A single firm-fixed price and cost contract will be awarded for this requirement. All proposals will be evaluated for lowest price/technical acceptability.<br>b.	 Award will encompass the entire Performance Work Statement (PWS).  No partial awards will be made.  Offerors must propose to perform all the aspects of the PWS to be considered for award.<br>c.	Award Without Discussions:  As set forth in FAR 52.212-1(g), the Government intends to award without discussions.  Accordingly, offerors are advised to submit initial proposals that are fully and clearly satisfactory without the need for additional information or explanation and containing the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.<br><br>d.	  Competitive Range Determination:  As set forth in FAR 15.306, in the event that the Government concludes that discussions are necessary, the Contracting Officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.  Therefore, offerors will be notified that the competitive range can be limited for purposes of efficiency.  The Contracting Officer may limit proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br><br><br>2. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br>Evaluation criteria consist of factors and sub-factors. The proposals will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  A proposal must be determined technically acceptable to be evaluated for past performance and price.The Technical factor and its sub-factors will be given a rating of "Acceptable," "Susceptible to being made acceptable," or "Unacceptable." The Past Performance factor will be given a rating of "Excellent," "Good," "Adequate," "Marginal," "Poor," or "Neutral."<br><br>Factors to Be Evaluated.<br><br>(a)  TECHNICAL EVALUATION. The Government will evaluate technical proposals to determine the adequacy of each offerors proposed approach to meeting the technical requirements of the PWS based on the sub-factors identified below.<br><br>(1)  Sub-factor 1, Experience - Demonstrated ability to perform the technical requirements for each of the functional areas (Preventive Maintenance and Repair Service Calls) identified within the PWS.<br>(2)  Sub-factor 2, Technical Approach - The offeror's proposed approach (scheduling, staffing, etc) to meet the PWS requirements<br>(3) Sub-factor 3, Certifications - The offeror's plant manager shall be a Grade 4 Water System Operator as classified by the Environmental Protection Agency. This certification must be maintained for the life of the contract. The offeror's plant operators shall have either a Grade 1 or Grade 2 Water System Operator as classified by the Environmental Protection Agency. This certification must be maintained for the life of the contract.<br><br>	The Technical factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings as defined below.  Any sub-factor that receives an unacceptable rating will result in an overall unacceptable rating for the factor and will not be eligible for award.<br><br>ADJECTIVAL RATING	DEFINITION<br>Acceptable	Acceptable quality and meets minimum PWS requirements necessary for satisfactory contract performance. Proposal contains no deficiencies or significant weaknesses, and any identified weaknesses do not impact the probability of meeting minimum requirements.  Fair probability of success with low to moderate degree of risk.<br>Susceptible to being made acceptable 	A proposal that satisfies most but not all of the minimum PWS requirements and/or in some instances fails to provide sufficient detail to demonstrate the feasibility of a proposed approach.  The proposal contains weaknesses (to include possible significant weaknesses) and/or some deficiencies, but the overall approach is sufficiently sound that the weaknesses and/or deficiencies may be corrected without a major rewrite of the proposal.  The degree of proposal risk is moderate to high. <br><br>Note:  A Susceptible rating cannot be a final rating. If award is made without discussions, a proposal initially evaluated as "Susceptible to being made acceptable" is not eligible for award.  If discussions are conducted and a proposal initially evaluated as "Susceptible to being made acceptable" is retained within the competitive range, the Final Proposal Revision evaluation must be "Acceptable" to be eligible for award. <br>Unacceptable	A proposal that fails to meet minimum PWS requirements necessary for acceptable performance. Where discussions are contemplated, the proposal contains weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies that cannot be corrected without a major rewrite of the proposal.  The degree of proposal risk is very high.<br><br>Note:  A final rating of Unacceptable in ineligible for award.<br><br><br>Deficiency - A material failure in a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.<br>		<br>Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contact performance.<br><br>Significant Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br><br>Uncertainty - A not clearly defined or unknown finding that may increase the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br><br>(b) FACTOR 2 - - PAST PERFORMANCE. The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  The past performance evaluation will focus on the quality of the offeror's recent and relevant current and past performance taking into consideration  the elements of Quality of Service, Schedule, Safety, Customer Satisfaction, and Business Relations.  In order for the Government to assess past performance, proposals shall include the following information relative to three current or completed (within the last three years) contracts relevant to the YPG requirement:<br><br>1)	Name of Contracting Activity that awarded the contract<br>2)	Contract Number and Period of Performance<br>3)	Contract Type (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursable, etc.)<br>4)	Total Contract Value<br>5)	Contracting Officer name and contact information<br>6)	Brief history of the airlift support services performed<br>7)	Name/organization/position and phone number of knowledgeable individual who can be queried by Government evaluators<br><br><br>ADJECTIVAL RATING	Description<br>Excellent	Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Performance Risk Level:  Very Low <br>Good	Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Performance Risk Level:  Low <br>Adequate	Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.  Performance Risk Level:  Moderate <br>Marginal	Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record. Performance Risk Level: High <br>Note:  A final rating of Marginal is ineligible for award.<br>Poor	It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record. Performance Risk Level: Very High<br>Note:  A final rating of Poor is ineligible for award.<br>Neutral	The offeror has insufficient/no relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Performance Risk Level:  Unknown <br><br><br>	(c)  FACTOR 3 - PRICE<br>Price will not be assigned an adjectival rating; however, unreasonably proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from the competitive range.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b).  <br><br> (End of provision)<br><br><br>52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) <br><br>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):<br><br>http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm<br><br>(End of clause)<br><br><br><br>Local Clause 5152.233-4000, AMC-Level Protest Program (Nov 2008)<br><br>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve<br>those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to <br>Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested<br>parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution<br>forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external<br>forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and<br>within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve<br>protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the<br>periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest<br>Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address<br>below.

<p>FAR 52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010)<br />(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

<p>(b) The offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.</p>

<p>(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.</p>
<p>(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.</p>
<p>(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-</p>
<p>(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or</p>
<p>(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.</p>
<p>(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.</p>
<p>(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.</p>
<p>(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7).<br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance: Technical capability, Past Performance, delivery time frame, and Price. Offerors shall provide name, title, and phone number of principal for no less than three prior or current contracts for similar contracts performed during the previous three years.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
