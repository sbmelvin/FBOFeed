<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 08-04-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 5 June 2008; FY 09 by 1 March 2009. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br />Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement and Supporting Technology, to include testing of prototype capabilities. Solutions to basic and applied research and engineering for the problems relating to Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement and Supporting Technology are sought. This includes high risk, high payoff capabilities for gaining access to any remotely located open or closed computer information systems; these systems enabling full control of a network for the purposes of information gathering and effects based operations. Of interest are any and all techniques to enable user and/or root level access to both fixed (PC) or mobile computing platforms. Robust methodologies to enable access to any and all operating systems, patch levels, applications and hardware are of interest. Also, we are interested in technology to provide the capability to maintain an active presence within the adversaries' information infrastructure completely undetected. Of interest are any and all techniques to enable stealth and persistence capabilities on an adversaries infrastructure. This could be a combination of hardware and/or software focused development efforts. <br />Following this, it is desired to have the capability to stealthily exfiltrate information from any remotely-located open or closed computer information systems with the possibility to discover information with previously unknown existence. Any and all techniques to enable exfiltration techniques on both fixed and mobile computing platforms are of interest. Consideration should be given to maintaining a "low and slow" gathering paradigm in these development efforts to enable stealthy operation. Finally, this BAA's objective includes the capability to provide a variety of techniques and technologies to be able to affect computer information systems through Deceive, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Destroy (D5) effects. Of interest are any and all techniques including enabling D5 effects to computers and their networks; integration of effects with Access, Stealth and Persistence and Cybint capabilities; command and control of effects; and determining effects' link to operational impact. In addition to these main concepts, we desire to have research efforts in the supporting areas including (but not limited to): Information Assurance through Flattened Computer Architectures in special application/user environments; NGPSec: Secure Next Generation Protocol Suite to investigate feasibility and determine whether reinventing the network protocol stack can be done and the resulting success quantified; Proactive Botnet Defense Technology Development specifically as applies to new ideas/concepts for practical application; Carbon nanotubes for high density interconnects and RF applications, to allow for incorporating novel IA designs into computer architectures through nanotube interconnects with nanotube based RF peripherals (antennas).</p>
<p>Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing the Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement problem. However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting applicable techniques will also be considered, if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. <br />Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels. Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII before submitting any classified white papers.</p>
<p>This effort includes any and all techniques to enable user and/or root level access to both fixed (PC) or mobile computing platforms, using robust methodologies to enable access to operating systems, patch levels, applications, and hardware of interest. Further techniques include enabling of stealth and persistence capabilities on an adversarial infrastructure, possibly in combination with hardware and/or software focused development. In addition, other areas include techniques to enable exfiltration on both fixed and mobile computing platforms with consideration given to maintaining a "low and slow" gathering paradigm to enable stealthy operation. Finally the effort includes any and all techniques to enable D5 effects to computers/networks; and integration of these effects with access, stealth, persistence, Cybint capabilities; command and control of effects; and determination of effects link operational impact. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and results of experiments which provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research. Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (ie brassboards) if appropriate.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical, operational approach and program milestones/schedule; (2) Experimental approach for evaluation of the technology; (3) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's Computer Network Attack (CNA)/Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) Information Assurance requirements; (4) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; and (5) The reasonableness and realism of: proposed costs, fee (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access at the appropriate level at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>W. John Maxey<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3617<br />Email: William.Maxey@rl.af.mil</p>

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Cross Domain Innovation & Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Information Directorate is interested in secure, accreditable services to assist in sharing information between two or more independent security domains. 

Key Terms:

Secure: The solutions must be highly resistant to inappropriate use, either deliberate or accidental.

Accreditable: The solutions must be able to pass appropriate accreditation procedures, such as DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/3, and/or the emerging National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) 8500 standards in its final form. (Systems will not need to be immediately accredited, but must make all reasonable efforts to retain the ability to be accredited via best practices and good security design, such as Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA’s) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) series)

Need to Know: Not every user will necessarily be allowed access to every potential resource. Solutions must have appropriate measures to allow enforcement of access policies.

Sharing: Information handled through these solutions must be able to be easily shared with appropriate personnel and/or systems. This typically requires adherence to published data, security, infrastructure and interoperability standards such as those available from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) among others. In general, solutions should be capable of interacting appropriately via Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/web service means.

Independent Security Domains: By default, each level of classification is required to run on physically separated infrastructures. Cross-domain solutions are the bridges between these infrastructures, and hence require an exceedingly detailed security analysis and risk identification.

Specific Focus Areas for FY 2009: 

Security Labeling Assurance & Pedigree:  Defining the standards, interrelationships, processing and security requirements for assuring appropriate labeling of information with metadata. The goal is to allow the Operating System (OS), applications, storage, and transport mechanisms to enforce appropriate access policies to information.
 
HAP & MILS Architecture Adaptation to W/S & Mobile Platforms:  Researching the High Assurance Platform (HAP) and other multi-level operating systems architectures such as Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) and Multi-Level Security (MLS). Investigate their performance with multi-level environments (such as Multi-Level Repositories (MLR), among others) in the interest of determining how they adapt to workstations, mobile platforms and other platforms.  Addressing issues such as cost and benefit comparison, scalability, bandwidth requirements, the ability to integrate policy models, and system performance.

Cognitively-Assisted Cross-Domain Information Sharing:  Applying cognitively assisted information technologies to assist in automated and reliable human review of data, automated labeling of data, and/or assisting human labeling efforts.  Using knowledge based technologies, natural language processing, case-based learning and the like, providing assistance in classification labeling of documents and parts of documents.  The goal of this technology is to assist users developing documents, users reviewing documents and data being automatically produced by mission applications in labeling textual data based on current information sharing policies.  Another goal of this effort is developing machine reasoning to attach appropriate metadata labeling to support the transmission of data to other security domains.  This technology should easily integrate into SOA for ease of use and accessibility for enterprise and cross domain information sharing.

Secure cross domain discovery of web services:  Securing Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) or functionally similar capabilities for cross domain application, including implementation of need-to-know verification checks and related capabilities.

General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs: 

MILS/MLS technologies: MILS & MLS technologies are operating systems or equivalents which allow for trustworthy handling of data at different classifications. These are often core functionalities utilized in cross domain solutions. Examples of MILS systems include Green Hills “Integrity” Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) (as part of the current HAP effort) or Wind River’s offerings. Examples of MLS operating systems include Trusted Solaris 8, Solaris 10 with Trusted Extensions, or Security Enhanced Linux (SE-Linux).
Object level auditing: Modern auditing is typically performed on specific events, such as accessing a new process, potential modification point, etc. This tends to lead to massive amounts of audit data, some with little or no security relevance. An alternate approach is to have data objects be capable of recognizing appropriately auditable events – creation, deletion, copying, etc – and report their occurrence to some centralized service(s). Such an effort would face an extreme amount of validation requirements to be accreditable.
Policy-based configuration: Most systems typically are independently configured, leading to difficulty in reconfiguring a network of systems to handle an overarching change. Additionally, most are directly configured, rather than being dynamically reactive to policy changes. Having systems being both centrally configured and reactive to policy changes could greatly reduce the administrative overhead of such systems. 
Workflow Enforcement: Most systems are good at maintaining a workflow within their capabilities. However, few systems are easily adaptable to enforce new workflows across multiple systems, maintaining non-repudiation and auditability across each step. This general focus area seeks to rectify this gap.
Redaction: The ability to modify an information flow (either in limited formats, or optimally, in any format) to remove information inappropriate to its destination. The ultimate goal would be a system capable of automatically preventing inadvertent or malicious release of inappropriate information while not restricting the appropriate sharing of information. Further challenges include determining the point at which redaction removes the value of transmitting any resulting information, potentially reducing bandwidth/processing requirements for cross domain solutions.
Label/Metadata Validation: Being able to assure that the content (‘data’) matches the labels and metadata associated with it. This is a dual task – not only assuring by (preferably automated) inspection that there is an appropriate linkage between specific data and metadata, but allowing for highly-trusted validation mechanisms to reduce the computational overhead, while still fulfilling the certification and accreditation requirements.
Improved/Reliable Human Review: Increasing the speed and efficiency of the human review process required on transfer of most information from a higher classification domain to a lower classification domain. Methods are expected to be highly variable, from machine comprehension to statistical techniques to hidden content mining and including many others.
Enterprise Common Operational Picture (COP) – An awareness of challenges, risks and problems to an enterprise is critical to being able to respond appropriately to reach resolution. As such, we are looking into how to generate a COP of the entire enterprise, regardless of classification. Note that there are some non-trivial operational and need-to-know issues involved.
Policy management: Being able to represent policies for access to system resources electronically, allowing for a simple policy change to affect the configuration of systems and networks. See also Policy-based configuration, above.
Service management: Given the growing interest in and support of SOA in the various domains, improving the management of such resources becomes increasingly urgent. Adding in the desire of many customers to form ‘mashable’ (read, rapidly adaptable by users) interfaces to critical data sources via SOA, this management requirement becomes even more critical. Additional concerns come into play when these single-domain SOA-based enterprises begin incorporating cross domain solutions. 
Interoperable systems: Wherever possible, solutions provided to this BAA should follow open standards. Examples of these include the standards offered by the W3C, OASIS, Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC) and others.
Label Integrity & Classification: Being able to appropriately label information is an early precursor to flattening the networks. As such, the integrity of the labels – especially classification labels – is critical in the long run. Various methods are being researched for this, from authoritative information servers to various cryptographic binding methods, and including other approaches.
Data Aggregation & Attestation: A classic concern with automated data handling is the data aggregation issue, also referred to as the ‘sources and methods’ problem. That is, a document made up of multiple pieces of information may end up with a final classification higher than any of its constituent parts. Finding methods to assure this does not happen within automated, adaptable services is a major challenge, and finding methods to attest that it has not occurred increase the level of difficulty.
Data pedigree: Knowing information is important, but knowing where that information is derived from is at least as important in evaluating it. As such, there are many different ways to maintain the history (or ‘pedigree’) of information. Issues arise when one attempts to send this pedigree cross domain – either due to resources being unavailable (cryptographic key stores, for instance) or due to policies preventing such transfers. 
Trustworthy labeling tools & services: Given the importance of appropriate labeling of data in a flattened networking environment, the tools to add labeling to data become very important targets of malicious users. Finding ways to assure that the labeling is correct and not maliciously applied or reapplied become critical.
Identity management. Maintaining track of who has access to what resources is a non-trivial, but mostly understood challenge within a single domain. When this capability is extended into a cross domain environment, many critical issues immediately arise and make what seems reasonably solvable in a single domain quite thorny. Examples include need-to-know issues, such as: Do low-side users need to know about high-side users? When and why and how do you allow only appropriate information flows?
Storage of sensitive data with multiple owners: Given the focus of centralization of capabilities currently ongoing within the various communities (Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC)s, Regional Service Centers (RSCs), etc), the issue of sensitive information owned by multiple disparate organizations being collocated on a single device becomes a potential showstopper. Finding ways to protect the need to know of the information at a level acceptable to all the various data owners in question becomes a very difficult problem, especially when you add in the modern need-to-share requirements.
Secure non-hierarchical data sharing. The Bell-LaPadula concepts (‘Write up, read down’) work extremely well for hierarchical data classification schemes. However, we have many non-hierarchical data classification schemes in use across the various domains – releasability, caveats and code words are all examples of non-hierarchical classification schemes. What are the equivalents of Bell-LaPadula’s concepts in such information spaces?
Appropriate discovery and subscription to data flows in other domains.  A common theme across academic approaches to web services and SOA is discovery – sharing information about how to get information. This is a great advantage to the transfer of information, but is completely insecure. To allow for discovery of services in trusted networks, there must be some level of need-to-know enforcement built into the standard academic discovery approaches. 
Disadvantaged (‘tactical’) user support. The Tactical user is unable to handle the information load expected within the enterprise, as they are typically limited to the computer hardware they can carry or have mounted to a vehicle. Yet these users are still in need of many of the enterprises’ data feeds, and are the ultimate reason for those enterprises’ existence. How do we link these users back into the enterprises, given the challenges on weight, power, bandwidth, and effective time? (Would you rather have a soldier performing administrative tasks, or fighting?)

NOTE:  White papers are not being solicited for FY 2010/2011 at this time.  The research descriptions that follow are for informational purposes only.  Additional information for these FYs and beyond will be provided under modifications to this BAA.
2010: 
Information Security Metadata Formulation:  Researching & implementing a method to link data and metadata within and across domains in a trustworthy manner. This includes gathering security policies for relevant domains into a standardized, appropriately accessible framework, potentially allowing for single-point configuration of multiple security domains.

Dynamic, Adaptive Security Policy Expression, Machine Reasoning & Learning: Developing a standardized multi-domain security policy system to automate the transfer of appropriate data and metadata as required.  This centralized policy system should be easily and dynamically adaptable to new environments in a secure and trustworthy manner. 

2011: 
Trusted Information Sharing Across Domains: Developing an accreditable, automatable, multi-domain security policy, including provisions for adaptation to changes in policy, data, and requirements. The goal of this effort is demonstrating information sharing across multiple security domains with changing configurations.

FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to 

ATTN: Michael J. Mayhew
AFRL/RIEB
525 Brooks Road
Rome, NY 13441-4505
 
Electronic submission to Michael.Mayhew@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.  

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

The capability to work in a classified facility with classified data may be required.  White Papers / Proposals should identify any cleared personnel and access to classified facilities for completing tasks outlined above.

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

   Michael J. Mayhew
   (315) 330-2898
   Michael.Mayhew@rl.af.mil

Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to the cognizant contracting officer, as specified below:

    Lori Smith
    Telephone (315) 330-1955

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA.  The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:

	Susan Hunter
	Building 15, Room 225
	1864 Fourth Street
	Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130

<DESC>Project DescriptionIndian Affairs (IA) is implementing a structuredProject Portfolio Management (PPM) discipline for theOffice of its Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and theIndian Affairs Project Management Office (IAPMO).  Tohelp manage Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureauof Indian Education (BIE)in a more effective manner, aconcerted effort is being made to establish theprocesses, procedures, tools and organizations neededto implement best practices.  IA OCIO plans to acquire the PPM solution, servicesand training required to successfully install,configure and implement Project Portfolio Management. The IA PPM solution will be used by Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)executives, management and project managers to manageand monitor their programs, portfolios and projects.IA understands the evolution of the Project PortfolioManagement market segment as one that originated withthe principles and practices of project management,which then grew to Program Management.  An outgrowthof this market, based on business needs, is known asPortfolio Management.  The differences between thesesegment subdivisions is that project management isfocused on individual projects in terms of scope, costand schedule, while Program Management is focused ongroupings of more than one interrelated orinterdependent projects and also of groups of similarprojects within a program.  Project PortfolioManagement continues to make use of the projectmanagement skills and data from both of thesedisciplines, but is oriented toward the comprehensivecollection of investments and theirinterrelationships, examining return on investment,project and program priorities, alignment of allaspects of the portfolio and organization with itsenterprise architecture, strategic planning, executivemanagement and decision support. In simpler terms,Project and Program Management focuses on doing thejob right whereas Portfolio Management focuses ondoing the right job.  The processes and proceduresto be followed will be in accordance with standards,as defined in the Project Management Institutes (PMI)Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)  andother government and industry best practices andstandards.The IA PPM solution will provide the followingcapabilities that are outlined in detail in theStatement Of Work (SOW): Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) isDOIs process by which BIA and BIE informationtechnology investments are selected for funding,managed, and evaluated to ensure expected results areachieved.  Portfolio AnalysisThe Portfolio Analysis Process captures and maintainsBIA and BIEs currently installed and future base ofIT and non-IT investments, scores investments(systems, applications, and infrastructure)periodically based upon functional and technicalperformance criteria, and supports integratedportfolio analysis, sensitivity analysis, andreporting capabilities across user selected projects,programs, and portfolios to create to the maximumextent possible, a seamless management view of theOCIO and non-OCIO Enterprise Portfolios.

<CONTACT>
<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM), 9500 Gilman Drive, DEPT 0811, La Jolla, CA 92093-0811 for supplemental publication services regarding a special supplement "Measures of the Food and Physical Activity Environments."</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be from date of award through December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, co-sponsored the workshop "Measures of the Food and Built Environments: Enhancing Research Relevant to Policy on Diet, Physical Activity and Weight" in November 2007.  The supplement will present the results of the workshop activities, including commissioned papers, workshop presentations and breakout group discussions.</p>
<p>The scope of work will include managing the review of manuscripts, copy editing, and publishing "Measures of the Food and Physical Activity Environments" as an AJPM supplement.  The contractor will be available during regular business hours by phone, e-mail, and fax. Review involves sending out manuscripts to designated reviewers, collating reviews and sending them to the supplement editors for responses and assessment, and sending the supplement editors responses and masked reviews to each author for revision and assessment of the revision by the supplement editors.  Copy editing involves careful review of each manuscript to ensure that the format is consistent with AJPM standard formatting, that tables and references are complete and correctly formatted, that language, syntax, and grammar are clear and correct, that author statements are referenced or justified as necessary, and that tables and figures are clearly and accurately explained.  Publication includes distribution of the monograph to AJPM institutional print subscribers, individual print subscribers who request a copy, libraries, and production of the online version. No color pages for the supplement are anticipated at this time.</p>
<p>Deliverables:<br />&bull;	One copy of the monograph to each corresponding author<br />&bull;	50 copies of the monograph to the Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch/ARP/DCCPS/NCI<br />&bull;	PDFs for posting on government website</p>
<p><br />The American Journal of Preventive Medicine is the only appropriate contractor for fulfilling the objectives of this market requisition because it: 1) reaches the NCI's unique, intended audience, 2) regularly publishes supplements of the sort that NCI has proposed, and 3) provides unusual flexibility in the format of articles.  No other known behavioral research journal provides a comparable publication that would reach the unique, multidisciplinary audience of researchers interested in the food and built environments from the following fields: public health, exercise science and behavioral sciences; city and transportation planning; parks, recreation, and leisure sciences; as well as diet and nutrition.  Working with AJPM would allow the manuscripts included in the supplement to be presented in the most appropriate format.  Manuscript submissions of original work are peer-reviewed to evaluate originality, scientific quality and relevance to a broad readership. Therefore, AJPM is the only known company that can provide the service needed to publish this supplement.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on May 27, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80071-MM on all correspondence.</p>

The services being sought by this notice are related to the establishment and operation of a large repository to receive, store, process, and ship biological, chemical and drug formulation samples that will be collected throughout multiple studies (as described below).  NICHD anticipates that the repository will periodically distribute portions of stored samples to laboratories at the direction of the Government.  

Since the inception of the BPCA 2002, NICHD has awarded approximately fifteen (15) individual projects to organizations for the purposes of gathering information to improve pediatric therapeutics and inform pediatric labeling.  Samples from these ongoing studies may be integrated into the samples collected and processed from future studies described in this notice.  Further information relating to the BPCA can be found at:  http://bpca.nichd.nih.gov/.  In September 2007, BPCA was reauthorized as part of the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA).  The legislation directs NICHD to initiate studies of critical importance to specific pediatric therapeutic areas to obtain results that will be submitted to FDA for consideration of labeling changes, and used to improve pediatric therapeutics.  NICHD anticipates that the clinical studies conducted under BPCA 2007 will focus on the PK/PD, safety and efficacy of therapeutics (including drugs, biologics, and therapeutic lifestyle modifications) used in children, and the pre-clinical studies will provide vital information to the pediatric therapeutics development processes.  

NICHD anticipates that thousands of diverse biological specimens and chemical specimens will be collected from the preclinical (including samples from experimental animals and humans) and clinical (including samples from humans) studies conducted in 5 to 10 therapeutic areas (with multiple therapeutic approaches within each therapeutic area).  
&#61607;	Approximately 6,000 (six thousand) samples per year from phase 1 clinical studies
&#61607;	Approximately 15,000 (fifteen thousand) samples per year from phase 2 clinical studies
&#61607;	Approximately 500 (five hundred) samples per year from preclinical animal studies
&#61607;	Approximately 100 (one hundred) samples per year from formulation development studies

Biological samples may include, but are not limited to, tissue and organ samples, blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva, buccal cells, breast milk, placentas, umbilical cord, vaginal swabs, cord blood, and meconium from experimental animals as well as human participants, with studies conducted in vivo and in vitro.  Chemical and drug samples may include, but are not limited to, the active ingredient and excipients used in the formulation of a drug, solvents, vehicles, drug metabolites and breakdown products.  Samples from biologics may include materials used in preparing these therapeutic approaches, as well as samples from animals or humans treated with these therapies.  Additionally, prepared ampulated samples, such as digestates or extracts, and residual drug, chemical or biologic samples may be required to be stored. 

Plans for a repository for the multiple therapeutic studies being considered are evolving.  Technical requirements for the repository include shipping all samples directly from specific study sites to a central receiving repository where they will be processed, alliquotted and stored.  It is anticipated that some studies will be conducted outside of the United States, predominantly in European Union (EU) countries.  All sample processing, shipping and storage activities will be conducted under Good Laboratory Procedures (GLP) and other relevant regulatory requirements for studies conducted in the EU and US with Data being submitted for regulatory consideration (FDA, EMEA).  Periodically, at the direction of the Government, the repository will send aliquots to analytic and clinical laboratories.  Alternatively, some samples may be shipped first to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories for analysis with remaining material sent to the main repository.  The ability to move a fraction of the biological and drug samples to a separate geographic location is required to mitigate the risk of sample loss in a disaster.  

The repository shall be located in facilities with specific space allocated from the purpose of this contract, including back-up electrical supplies for computers and storage resources.  

The RFP will be available electronically on or about May 27, 2008 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire on a sole source basis with MicroCal, LLC. in Northampton, MA an iTC200 MicroCalorimeter.

The ability to quantitate binding interactions is essential for research within our department.  Isotherm titration calorimetry (ITC) is the only technique that can simultaneously elucidate the accurate determination of binding constants, reaction stoichiometry, enthalpy and entropy, thereby providing a complete thermodynamic profile of the molecular interaction in a single experiment.  An iTC200 will be employed to fully characterize molecular interactions and quantify the binding of substrates, in particular to study interactions between proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, cofactors, ligands, and drugs.  The MicroCal iTC200 isothermal titration calorimeter is the only instrument that can perform these characterizations.

This award is IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquires may be addressed to Nadine Utz, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Room A1040C, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 by 19 May 2008 at 12:00 p.m.

<DESC><p>This is a sources sought synopsis announcement; a market survey for information only. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources; please do not request a copy of a solicitation, as one does not exist.
<p>The 77 Aeronautical Systems Group, Contracting Division (77 AESG/PSK), Brooks City-Base TX is seeking, for preliminary planning purposes only, qualified and experienced sources that have the capability to provide a non-developmental full coverage Anti-G ensemble (G-suit).</p>
<p>Current G-suits rely on a 50-year-old 5 bladder design that uses pressurized air from the Environmental Control System (ECS). The pressure provided to the G-suit is based on the acceleration forces sensed by the G-Valve. This pneumatic system takes a few seconds for optimal operation, and requires the aircrew to perform anti-G straining techniques. The intensity of the straining varies from "extreme," during the on-set period to "moderate" based on the duration and the level of relief provided by the G-suit.</p>
<p>77 AESG/PSK is attempting to identify non-developmental systems that provide full coverage High-G protection using on-board compressed air and associated regulating mechanisms. In addition, systems should not require aircraft modifications and be considered safe for flight and ejection. Proposed systems should be reliable, durable, and integrate with existing life support equipment, and have the capability to accommodate the male and female aircrew population.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government is seeking interested firms to furnish the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. (2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 315999. (3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide supplies identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 315999 to be more appropriate as a classification for the supplies identified above? Please include the rational for your answer. (4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. (5) Provide no more than three (3) references for no more than three (3) of the most recent and relevant contracts performed within the last three (3) years. Include name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of references. Also, provide a brief description of the work performed, and period of performance. Information on contracts must be the same or similar to the nature of this inquiry.</p>
<p>Information submitted will be used for planning purposes. Responses should be sent to 648 AESS /TAA (attn: Lt Hayden), 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks-City Base, TX 78235-5119. The response should include one paper copy and an electronic copy. This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a request for proposal, and in no way commits the Government to an award of a contract. Reimbursement of any cost regarding the preparation of proposals or bids will not be made.

<DESC>IntroductionNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites potential offerors to submita response to this RFI to find interested and qualified sources and planning informationfor the design, development, and manufacture of a compressive-force release Non-ExplosiveActuator (NEA).  The NEA will be utilized on Ground Support Equipment for theConstellation Program to allow T-0 separation of the flight side and ground sideumbilical plates. It is envisioned that this potential acquisition may ultimately result in the award of acompetitively awarded best value Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contractbased.	Stated below are the projected quantities that are envisioned to be needed. Approximately 4 will be needed within the next 6-12 months for testing and validation. 	2010	2011	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019   TOTAL		   16	   8	   16	   16	   16	  16	   16	  24	   24	  24	 160The Government will provide in its Request for Proposal a performance specification withGovernment Furnished Drawings.	It will be incumbent upon each Offeror to determine thedrawings suitability for use.The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information from industryto assist Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in its acquisition development.  NASA reserves theright to share all information received in response to this RFI throughout NASA and touse all information submitted in response to this RFI in NASAs formulation of asolicitation seeking competitive proposals.  However, any submitted competition sensitivedata should be clearly marked and will not be shared outside of NASA.  Althoughinformation contained herein represents current program content and acquisition planning,it is subject to change.  Response to this RFI is requested within the context of thegeneral approach described in the following paragraphs.NEA OVERALL DESCRIPTIONThe size of the NEA shall be approximately 1.0 inch diameter and approximately 2.0 inchestall.  It should contain male threads of approximately .375 inch diameter and will bethreaded into an aluminum plate.  A 600lbf compressive force will applied to the pin orshaft.	The NEA will release the compressive force upon receipt of a T-0 electricalsignal by allowing the pin or shaft to retract into itself.  The shaft to which the loadis applied is approximately .200 diameter and will require a minimum stroke of .250. See Figure 1. Figure 1  Basic shape of NEA	Electrical: The actuator shall release the load in less than 100 millisecondsafter receiving the electrical signal. It is requested that responses to this RFI includean appropriate/typical circuit for actuation of the NEA	Environment:  The NEA shall be sealed from an outdoor environment and shall bemade from a non-corrosive material.	Reliability: Because of the critical nature of the separation of the umbilicalplates at liftoff, high reliability of the NEA is a primary concern.	Premature Release:  Possibly even more important than releasing the load whenelectrical signal is received is NOT releasing the load until the signal is given.  SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOLICITEDResponders to this RFI are encouraged to comment on any of the foregoing and to expresstheir interest in this proposed acquisition by submitting the following information:1.	Organization name, address, description of principal activity, primary point ofcontact and business size.2.	Cost  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for each prototype, each production unitand estimated total program cost.3.	Lead Times  Describe lead times required for prototypes and productions units.4.	Reliability  Provide reliability/ failure rate data for similar types ofdevices.5.	Experience  Describe your experience in developing and producing NEA,	as wellas what programs or customers have used the device. 6.	Proposed/Representative actuation circuitRecommend an appropriate circuit foractuating the NEA device.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONSThe requested responses are for information and planning purposes only.  NASA does notintend to post information or questions received to any website or public accesslocation.  NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses.  Feedback to thisRFI may be utilized in formulating the Governments acquisition strategy and documents.All responses should be provided in MS Word document format, both hard and electronicmedia.	Font should be Times New Roman, size 12.  Responses should not exceed 15 pagesand should reference RFI-KSC-NEA.  Responses must be received no later than June 9,2008, to NASA/KSC Procurement Office, ATTN: OP-ES/Christina L. Williams, ContractingOfficer, Kennedy Space Flight Center, FL 32899.This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subjectto FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request forQuotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter intoa contract.  Moreover, the Government will not pay for the information submitted inresponse to this RFI, nor will the Government reimburse an Offeror for costs incurred toprepare responses to this RFI.No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of thesolicitation.

<RESPDATE>052108
<CONTACT>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ), REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR INVITATION FOR BID (IFB).  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., service disabled veteran owned small businesses, 8(a)s, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the requirement.  Potential sources must demonstrate that they have the experience and capabilities to perform the tasks described in this notice.

The Office of Community Services (OCS), within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families, administers nine (9) Federal programs.  The mission of OCS is to work in partnership with states, communities, and other agencies to provide a range of human and economic development services and activities which ameliorate the causes and characteristics of poverty and otherwise assist persons in need.  The aim of these services and activities is to increase the capacity of individuals and families to become self-sufficient, to revitalize communities, and to build the stability and capacity of children, youth, and families so that they become able to create their own opportunities.  

The mission of the Compassion Capital Fund (CCF), which is administered by OCS, is to increase the capacity of grassroots organizations and community coalitions to provide social services that support children, families, and communities.  CCF seeks to help faith-based and community organizations build their capacity – that is, increase their effectiveness, enhance their ability to provide social services to serve those most in need, expand their organizations, diversify their funding sources, and create collaborations to better serve low income individuals, families, and communities.  CCF currently administers three (3) grant programs: the Demonstration program, the Communities Empowering Youth (CEY) program, and the Targeted Capacity Building (mini-grant) program.  

The CCF National Resource Center (NRC) has been established to provide program management and administrative support to the CCF Program Office.  Such support helps ensure that organizations awarded grants under the CCF Program or related programs are able to fully meet the objectives and goals of their awards and appropriately manage their grants. 

OCS intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the future and is seeking capability statements from organizations with the core capability to effectively manage and operate the CCF NRC.  Offerors must be able to: 

•	Oversee and track major activity performed under the CCF program by grantees of the Demonstration program, the CEY program, the mini-grant program, or any other discretionary grant program administered under CCF.   

•	Provide training and technical assistance to Demonstration grantees, CEY grantees, and mini-grantees, as well as any other discretionary grant program administered under CCF.

•	Serve as a repository and distribution center for information, tools, and resources needed by Demonstration grantees, CEY grantees, and mini-grantees, sub-awardees, partners, and other faith- and community-based organizations to improve their capacity, knowledge, and skills and assist with their programmatic and grants management. 

•	Provide assistance to the CCF Federal staff in support of the mission of CCF.

•	Ensure that all Demonstration grantees, CEY grantees, and mini-grantees, as well as other organizations funded under CCF, have the resources, tools, and information needed to successfully accomplish the objectives of their awards.

•	Ensure that Demonstration and CEY grantees provide technical assistance and training to faith-based and community organizations that is effective and appropriate for their needs and reflects sensitivity to their cultural environment.

•	Ensure that Demonstration grantees improve their outreach to grassroots organizations historically not involved in similar initiatives and appropriately address the capacity building needs of such organizations. 

•	Bring appropriate resources together to ensure that services that meet the needs of individuals, families, and communities most in need are improved and increased through the work of the organizations funded under CCF.

•	Plan, organize, and manage two annual conferences for CCF grantees that pull together expert information about effective methods and strategies for carrying out their grant-funded activities and managing their Federal awards.

•	Host, maintain, and expand the current CCF electronic clearinghouse, the CCF state-of-the-art websites, and the CCF grantee information database.  The current CCF grantee database is a comprehensive, web-based system that allows NRC and CCF program office staff a central location to store and track information related to grantees.  It allows the staff to find contact information, track consultations and contacts with grantees, see project information, descriptions, and funding levels, as well as upload and retrieve documents relevant to the grantee file.  

•	Coordinate the gathering and analysis of grantee data in order to respond to annual requests under the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to assess and improve program performance.

In responding to this sources sought announcement, small business concerns must:

1.	Have knowledge of and experience with overseeing and tracking major activity performed by awardees under Federal discretionary grant programs.   
2.	Have knowledge of and experience with providing training and technical assistance to awardees of discretionary grant programs, particularly with regard to issues of building the capacity of faith-based and community organizations.
3.	Have knowledge of and experience with hosting, maintaining, and expanding an electronic clearinghouse containing information, tools, and resources to help organizations improve their capacity, knowledge, and skills and assist with their programmatic and grants management. 
4.	Have knowledge of and experience with providing assistance to Federal program staff in support of a discretionary program.
5.	Have knowledge of and experience with working with organizations to ensure they have the resources and training necessary to provide effective technical assistance and training to faith-based and community organizations.
6.	Have knowledge of and experience with planning, organizing, and managing annual conferences – with at least 200 attendees – that pull together expert information about how to implement and manage effective grant programs.
7.	Have knowledge of and experience with hosting, maintaining, and expanding state-of-the-art websites and a comprehensive, web-based grantee information database.
8.	Have knowledge of and experience with coordinating the gathering and analysis of grantee data in order to track program performance under the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) annually.

Capability statements must demonstrate the knowledge of and experience with Items 1-8 above.  Please address each in the order listed above.  The Government encourages proposed teaming arrangements (i.e., subcontracting, joint ventures) in response to this announcement if potential sources deem such an approach to be most advantageous, however, any proposed arrangement of this kind must address all of the above and clearly explain which teaming partner provides which of the above capabilities.  Simply referring to the teaming arrangement as a whole as “the team” and discussing collective capabilities without discussion of the individual team members’ capabilities will not be considered sufficient by the Government.

The anticipated period of performance for this contract is one 12-month base period and the potential of four additional option periods for a total of 60 months.

Interested organizations should submit their written capability statements by 10:00 a.m. on May 21, 2008 to the Contracting Officer at the following email address:  medwards@psc.gov.  Emails should include the Reference Number of this Sources Sought notice in the subject header of their email.  Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.  The page limit is 10 pages.  Any questions must be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing to the email address listed.  

Capability statements must also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pads.         <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare System, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martin-tilghman@amedd.army.mil.    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pads, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $65,945.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period and include the following top high volume usage lines for this project: <BR><BR>PART # 	DESCRIPTION<BR>402-2204	MACROLYTE ADULT DUAL DISPERSIVE ELECTRODES, SINGLE-USE<BR>E7507		DISPOSABLE REM POLYHESIVE II RETURN ELECTRODE<BR>51-7310		THERMOGARD, AD, DUAL, CABLE<BR>9165		UNIVERSAL PAD W/SAFETY RING SPLIT PAD WITH CORD<BR>425-2508	PEDIATRIC REM GR PAD<BR>7-382		THERMOGARD, ABC, AD, DUAL, CABLE<BR>E7506		DISPOSABLE POLYHESIVE RETURN ELECTRODE<BR>450-2300	MACROLYTE, INFANT, SINGLE, CABLE<BR>E751025	DISPOSABLE INFANT REM POLYHESIVE II RETURN ELECTRODE<BR>440-2400	MACROLYTE, PREMIE, SINGLE, CABLE<BR>400-2100	ADULT DISPERSIVE ELECTROD 10' CABLE MACROLYTE ADH<BR>7-383		B-GUARD PLUS INFANT DUAL- CONDUCTOR MONITOR ELECT<BR>1149		PAT .PLATE, LG, NOCORD, 25/BX 4BX/<BR><BR>C.

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.      <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  <BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  <BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  <BR>3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.

Vendors must provide Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pads of such a design as to be an integral part of an ESU safety return electrode contact quality monitor (RECQM) or similarly operating safety system.  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets from the product group at no cost to the Government or the TRBO POC recipient, to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  Vendors will be given ten (10) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cast product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the TRBO Clinical Analyst.  Requested no-cost product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost product samples by 4:00PM EDT  on the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Extremely Poor; Two (2)Below Average; Three (3)Average; Four (4)Above Average; and Five (5)Excellent.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   <BR><BR>The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending  on the location of any break: in vendors Total Averaged Scores ((i.e. a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score Clinically Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score:  <BR><BR>1.  Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pad adhesive provides complete skin contact including pad edge continuity. [Addresses patient and environmental safety].  <BR>a. Grounding pad must adhere to patients skin with edge-attachment continuity for safe electrical conduction and to avoid pooling of body fluids/irrigation fluids under the Pad.    <BR>b. The evaluation team will review the literature and documentation provided by the vendors and evaluate criterion in a non-clinical setting.  <BR>c. The products will be evaluated by CPT members applying electrodes to simulated skin or on each others skin and observe that the pad completely contacts the surface including uniformity of pad edge adherence.  The expectation is that the electrosurgical pad provides good skin contact and the edges will be firmly intact against the skin, will provide uniform adherence even over hair and body contours.<BR>2. Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pad is flexible adhered to the skin and maintains skin-contact integrity over body contours during body part repositioning and during tension on the pad-generator connecting cord.  [Addresses patient and environmental safety]. <BR>     a. Grounding pad must adhere to patients skin with edge-attachment continuity during patient repositioning including during periods of tension on connection cord for safe electrical conduction.   <BR>b. The evaluation team will review the literature and documentation provided by the vendors and evaluate criterion in a non-clinical setting. <BR>c. The products will be evaluated by CPT members by manipulating another members body part or simulated body part with attached grounding pad to simulate patient repositioning and will apply tension on the connecting cord and observe that the pad completely contacts the surface including uniformity of pad edge adherence.  The expectation is that the product will adhere to the skin/simulated skin surface and not lose contact with movement/tension on connection cord. <BR>3.  Disposable Electrosurgical Grounding Pad is easily removed from contact without causing injury to tissue.  [Addresses patient safety/discomfort and infection control].<BR>a. Grounding pad must remove easily and completely without injury to underlying body tissue.    <BR>b. The evaluation team will review the literature and documentation provided by the vendors and evaluate criterion in a non-clinical setting.   <BR>c. The products will be evaluated by CPT members by removing a grounding pad adhered to another members body part and observe that the pad removes easily, completely and without injury to the body tissue (redness, swelling, blistering or any open break in the skin.  <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Regionrepresents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched productsand  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Linesunmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendorreduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, is more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation and meet the Clinically Acceptability target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Scoredepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Score (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Score) as determined by the CPT will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria and are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified form further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      <BR><BR>3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds.   in a proscribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.<BR><BR>4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested I the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendors quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  <BR><BR>The Northeast Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   <BR><BR>5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.   <BR> _____________________________________________________________________________<BR>END<BR>

This is a sources sought announcement only.  This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this information.  No reimbursement will be made associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up requests.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  All responses must be in written format; no telephone calls will be accepted.
This sources sought synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted to determine potential sources capable of providing Sailors and Marines with Tactical Casualty Combat Care with Live Tissue Training (TCCC with LTT).  The applicable NAICS is 541711.
In preparation for a future procurement, the Regional Contracting Office, Northeast, Marine Corps Base (MCB), Quantico, VA  22134 is seeking the most effective and cost efficient manner possible to provide Sailors and Marines with LTT.  The government will examine two (2) possible Courses of Action (COA).  The first COA will examine contracting out the entirety of the TCCC with LTT for all contractors who provide proposals on the open contract. The government will evaluate curriculum cost data and estimates received for a complete TCCC with LTT course that includes classroom instruction and live tissue lab days.  The instruction period should be approximately five days in length, three classroom days and two live tissue lab days.  The first three days will teach the skills that are listed in the attached proposed requirement and the lab portion will give the students a chance to practice the skills that were taught in the previous three days.  The duration of this course should be five days; however, the contractor shall provide rationale for exceeding this objective. The second COA will examine military provision of the classroom portion of TCCC with LTT and contractor provision of the LTT laboratory portion.  The government will examine curriculum cost data and estimates received for live tissue lab days exclusively.  As indicated previously, the government anticipates two live tissue lab days.  The Marine Corps assumes that it will require TCCC with LTT training for a total of 1800 students annually in the vicinity of Field Medical Training Battalions East and West for the next five years.  Curriculum must comply with the SOW and its enclosures and instructions included in the attachment.  
In response to this sources sought synopsis a capability statement must be submitted that demonstrates extensive experience with, and ability to develop and perform the course described herein.  Responses must contain the following information:  (1) a one (1) page corporate summary including the contractors web site; (2) an extensive summary of the contractors relevant current and prior work experience to include resumes of trainers that exhibit a minimum of one year prior combat medical experience; (3) cost data responding to each above mentioned COA and curriculum requirements in the attachment; (4) description of any potential conflicts of interest the contractor may have in performing the work; (5) a brief description of the contractors qualify control processes for deliverables; (6) past performance information, to include contact information for similar work; and (7) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedules, Government contracts, or commercial pricing schedules.
The Government will conduct market analysis by reviewing each contractors capability statement.  Any contractor should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the contractors qualifications to perform.
Government professional services contractor(s) may have access to data submitted in response to this synopsis.  Proprietary and confidential information will not be accepted.  The Government believes that standard specifications and capabilities should sufficient to respond.  If a contractor believes that their response must include proprietary or confidential information in order to be considered, their response must be properly annotated.

<SOLNBR>8-36386
<RESPDATE>052208
<ARCHDATE>05232008
<CONTACT>
<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Thailand Faculty of Engineering, Bangkok, Thailand, for a Fire and Smoke Hazard Mapping System (HMS). NOAA/NESDIS/OSDPD Satellite Services Division (SSD) has created the HMS which is a satellite-based man-machine mix interactive fire and smoke analysis system to provide near real time, quality controlled analysis of fires and smoke in North America. However due to manpower limitations, it is impossible for SSD to do an HMS analysis worldwide even though smoke intrusions from other areas affect North America. To address this problem, and also in accord with the goals of GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems), the fire and smoke HMS has been exported to collaborators in other parts of the world for use in their regions. However there are limitations to the current HMS (which was developed largely ad hoc, as fire and smoke emergencies arose), and these limitations (1) adversely affect the SSD fire program and (2) limit the ease with which other nations can adopt the system.
<p>The King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang (KMITL) will adopt the system for Thailand, to use the HMS as a basis for the Southeast Asian Satellite-based Fire Mitigation Center that will analyze fires for all of Southeast Asia. The goal is to provide the expertise to create an improved HMS that will reduce or eliminate the limitations described above, thus enhancing SSD and its collaborators' fire programs as well as provide a system more easily integrated into the Southeast Asian Center.</p>
<p>Task include:<br />1) An HMS similar to the existing HMS in NOAA, (but with imagery, gui, etc. appropriate to Southeast Asia) will be set up and used as a comparison at each step as the new HMS prototype is developed. <br />2) Using MATLAB, geostationary and polar satellite imagery suitable for fire and smoke detection will be displayed in a new prototype system, and imagery manipulation (enhancements, roaming, zooming, etc.) will be optimized for speed and ease of use by analysts. At each step, the quality of the imagery itself and the speed and ease of manipulation in the new prototype will be compared to the existing HMS to determine whether the prototype is indeed better. <br />3) Additional data will be added as overlays including an automated fire detection algorithm from NASA, landcover information, frequent false fire detects, etc.<br />4) The analyst will be given the ability to depict fire and smoke locations in the new system. <br />5) The system will be capable of creating output files in forms useful to many users including shapefiles, jpgs, and ascii.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be released for this requirement. If an interested offeror believes it can provide these services based on the Government's requirements, it shall respond within the specified date, to the agency contact point, describing how it can satisfy the Government's needs without causing unacceptable delays, duplicating costs, or failure to meet technical objectives. Interested sources shall submit a written narrative of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature, demonstrating the ability to provide the required services in sufficient detail to permit an agency analysis to determine a bona-fide capability to meet the Government's requirements, within 10 days of the publication of this notice or by c.o.b. May 22, 2008. Responses without the required documentation shall be considered non-responsive. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this notice or the Government's use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. Responses must be submitted in writing (two copies) and must include all information cited herein. Submission shall be mailed to: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NESDIS Acquisition Management Division, SSMC3 - Room 10100/OFA64, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attention: E.

<DESC>REVISED:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  NAICS Codes solicited are 541110, 541191 and 541199.  The small business size standard listed for the NAICS Codes listed is $6.5 million.  This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  USACE, Vicksburg District, Real Estate Division proposes to award one or more BPAs to furnish materials, supplies, and services for title services in Mississippi and Louisiana, from time to time, if and when requested by the contracting officer or the authorized representative of the contracting officer in accordance with the specifications. The title services to be provide include but not limited to the following: Commitment of Title Insurance; Interim Binder; title search; multiple chains of title.  SCOPE OF WORK:  1.  Please be advised that the Real Estate Division has several Mississippi based projects and a potential large Mitigation Project in Louisiana scheduled over the next several years which will require the acquisition of various estates of land, at the present time we have five year Blanket Purchase Agreements.  At the present time we have no one to perform title services in the State of Louisiana and we need timely title service in Mississippi in all of the counties. We therefore are requesting that we procure at least two more Blanket Purchase Agreements.  One of the BPAs being Mississippi based and the other being Louisiana based.  2.  The scope of work for the Blanket Purchase Agreement consists of the Vendor's providing the following title services:  a)  The issuance of a Commitment for Title Insurance.  In this regard in our current Blanket Purchase Contracts with the above named Vendors paying are supplying Commitments for Title Insurance for $400.00.  This amount, it is felt, is in line with current market.  b)  The issuance of an Interim Binder (if needed).  Again under current BPAs the Vicksburg District is paying $150.00 for Interim Binders.  This also is in line with the amount paid in the current market.  c)  It is common practice that certain title searches require that multiple chains of title be run.  In this regard under the current BPAs we were paying $100.00 for each additional chain of title that was run.  We feel this is in line with the amount paid in the current market.  d)  The proposals from prospective Vendors contain an amount the Vendor would charge for the preparation of the Owner's Title Insurance Policy.  Preparation charges include the Vendor's courthouse work in updating the title search from the day of the initial Commitment of Title through the closing date.  At the present time we were paying $100.00 for the preparation of the Owner's Title Insurance Policy. This again we feel is a fair amount.  e)  The issuance of an Owner's Title Insurance Policy.  The underwriter must use an Issurance Company that is on the U.S. Attorney's list of approved title companies.  Although each Title Insurance Company rates vary, generally most companies offer insurance in line with the following:  $4.00 per thousand for $1.00 to $200,000.00; $3.00 per thousand for $200,000.00 to 1 million; and $2.00 per thousand for 1 million to 10 million.     If the cost for insurance falls below $100.00 most title insurance companies charge a $100.00 minimum fee for the Issuance of a Policy and this is acceptable to the government.  In our Request for Quotes we should state that if the Title Insurance Company over the 5 year period increased its rates, we would be willing to increase what we would pay for the insurance accordingly as long as the insurance provider remained on the U.S. Attorney approved list.  3.  It is requested that the Blanket Purchase Agreement contain a clause that states that all title orders be filled in a timely manner.  A timely manner for the purposes of the Agreement shall be that orders of three Commitments or less will be filled no later than 14 days after receipt of the order.  If more than three Commitments are ordered at one time, then after the initial 14 day period in which the Vendor will fill a minimum of three orders, thereafter the Vendor will deliver a minimum of two orders per week until the order is completed.  Unless otherwise specified, delivery of Interim Binders shall be filled no later than 14 days from receipt of the request and Insurance Policies shall be issued no later than thirty (30) days from the receipt of such order.  The BPA duration will be upto 5 years.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement. Establishment of BPAs does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered.  The establishment of BPAs does not justify purchasing from only one source.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement.   BPA holders will be selected based on successful past performance.  The BPA duration will be upto 5 years.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement. Establishment of BPAs does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.

Responses to this announcement must include past performance information to include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the supplies/services provided.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<SUBJECT>Public relations and media program 
<SOLNBR>RFP521-08-005
<RESPDATE>051608
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Resultant award is subject to the availability of funds.

The solicitation Number is RFP 521-08-005 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-013.  The USAID Haiti Mission requires the services of a highly qualified firm – completely familiar with the country, people and media outlets of Haiti – to conduct a national public relations and media program to assist USAID in highlighting achievements made by the United States Government (USG), through USAID, in technical areas, provincial regions and for the Haitian people on a national scope.  The period of this contract will be two (2) years.  The purpose of the public relations and media program is to achieve four objectives:
•	Make the Haitian people more aware of USAID/Haiti activities and results, particularly those that affect Haitians on a daily basis.
•	Promote USAID/Haiti activities and results to concerned audiences, particularly those in the United States and Haiti, but also including the Haitian Diaspora and other donors in Haiti.
•	Increase local understanding of what USAID/Haiti is and how it works.
•	Strengthen USAID/Haiti’s image with the Haitian government and its citizens.


Description of Services:
To achieve these objectives, it is envisioned that the following outputs would be required:

o	The contractor shall generate and deliver a national public relations and media program to support USAID/Haiti efforts to increase its visibility to the Haitian people by promoting USAID/Haiti activities and results through appropriate media channels, using innovative and interesting publicity mediums that are directed at specific, target audiences.  
o	The contractor shall generate and deliver USAID/Haiti briefing materials, success stories, press information and creative publicity products.  
o	The contractor shall prepare monthly update material for posting to the USAID/Haiti external website and deliver it directly to USAID/Haiti.

Offerors are free to propose alternate outputs, consistent with the strategy proposed.


Background:  
Haiti and the United States enjoy a positive and productive relationship, bolstered by strong historical, cultural, and economic ties. However, despite the generally positive view some Haitians have of the United States, experience has shown that few people, including beneficiaries of USAID programs, really know and/or understand the nature, scope, and extent of U.S. assistance abroad. 

In Haiti, many educated civil and political leaders in general are acquainted with USAID/Haiti's work, but the average Haitian does not know that many of the development programs that have improved their lives on a daily basis are in fact USG programs, managed by USAID.  Consequently, many Haitians do not know how much USAID/Haiti has contributed and is contributing to develop his/her quality of life.  A better understanding of the positive efforts of the American people and government in Haiti will foster improved U.S.-Haitian relations and will support an already positive image of the United States among the Haitian population.

In the U.S., public diplomacy has become a leading foreign policy tool to achieve the goal of improving the image of the United States abroad and showcasing the impact of USG assistance.  USAID/Haiti has consistently taken steps to ensure that Haitians are aware of its development programs and achievements in Haiti.  The Ambassador, Mission Director, Deputy Mission Director, and Senior USAID officials are very involved in USAID/Haiti outreach and communication activities and, to a large extent, leading USAID’s efforts to ensure that the USG’s work in Haiti is constantly communicated to all Haitians.  The Mission undertakes many public relation events already, some of which include launching new projects, celebrating milestone completions with ceremonies and press releases, creating press opportunities nationwide by traveling to the provinces for program implementation and press events, and speaking regularly with concerned partners and parties to communicate joint USG and Government of Haiti (GOH) goals of contributing to Haiti’s social and economic development through USAID/Haiti foreign assistance programs.  

As part of its effort to evaluate successful outreach and communication activities, USAID/Haiti has contracted a U.S.-based polling firm to conduct semi-annual public opinion polls in Haiti from 2007-2010.  As part of these polls, respondents are asked about their opinions on USAID message effectiveness, respondents’ general awareness of USAID as an entity operating in Haiti, and respondent’s general association of USAID activities to improvements in their daily life, among others.  Relevant poll results will be shared with the successful offeror.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<RESPDATE>061308
<CONTACT>
<DESC><p>The recent tragic events at the Crandall Canyon, Darby, Alma, Sago, and Jim Walter Resources #5 (Brookwood) coal mines have all highlighted the need for reliable communications between miners inside and outside of mine (both before and after a disaster). Present hardwired communications systems may fail due to exposure to explosions, roof falls, inundations, and fires. During subsequent escape and rescue efforts, it is vital that communications, tracking, and atmospheric monitoring systems (AMS) remain operational. Survivability of these systems can be enhanced by component hardening and system redundancy. The contractor is encouraged to be creative and provide arguments for the development of any new or novel techniques that can help to enhance equipment reliability and survivability. On June 15, 2006, the &ldquo;Miner Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006&rdquo; (MINER Act), was signed by the President to amend the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. As part of the MINER act, underground coal mine operators must provide for post-accident communication between underground and surface personnel via a wireless two-way medium within three years (i.e., June 2009). The Act also requires an electronic tracking system for surface personnel to determine the location of any person trapped underground. Robust and reliable mine communications are critical to this standard for both routine mining operations and in any mine emergency. Reliability is defined as a set of attributes that bear on the capability of a system to maintain its level of performance under stated operating conditions for a given period of time without failure. An example of communications reliability is the probability that a message will arrive at its intended destination within a reasonable time and without undesired alteration of the text or loss of meaning. Reliability assessment is the determination of whether existing hardware, firmware, and/or software have achieved a specified level of operational reliability. For example, wireless networks are more prone to failures than hardwired networks and can have loss of access due to weak transmission power, underground terrain environment, interference, etc. Therefore the reliability requirements of wireless networks need to be rigorously assessed. Survivability is defined as the property of a piece of equipment or a system that provides a defined degree of assurance that the device or system will continue to work during and after a natural or man-made disturbance (explosion, fire, roof fall, pillar burst, power outage, inundation, etc.). For the purpose of this RFP, the survivability consists of two principal aspects: hardening and redundancy. Redundancy, is defined to exist where, after a mine incident occurs and communications are lost, a miner can travel a short distance from the affected area and still communicate with surface personnel. Redundancy is desired in all areas of the mine where hardwired and/or wireless coverage is provided, and the level of redundancy achieved will be a significant consideration. Various likely mine disaster scenarios need to be considered and evaluated on the effectiveness (reliability, survivability, maintainability, and ease of use) of the redundant solutions in all areas of the mine with particular focus on the active mining section. Hardening is defined as the measures taken to improve the ability of the system components to continue to perform during and after mine incidents including, but not limited to, explosions, roof falls, water inundations, fires, and power outages. Various approaches to hardening the system need to be listed and discussed. The successful quoter will focus on the active mining section(s) as it is the most likely location for a catastrophic event to occur. Hardening and redundancy may be more difficult to achieve in this area. Communication with, and tracking of, miners in face areas is essential. All major exposed external components associated with the communication, tracking and AMS systems for the purpose of hardening such systems should be examined. NIOSH recommends that both hardwired and wireless systems should support legacy UHF/VHF mine communication devices that are commonly used in mines today in order to minimize the impact on existing mine communication systems. NIOSH also suggests that in the near term, equipment survivability will be best achieved through additions and improvements to the existing leaky feeder systems and/or systems that supplement the existing leaky feeder system, rather than replacement of the existing leaky feeder system. Moreover, the contractor is encouraged to propose alternative approaches where it can be demonstrated that substantial benefits in cost, performance, reliability and/or survivability can be achieved by deviating from any solution(s) currently envisioned. Mine phones can be an integral part of an integrated communication system. While mine phones do not meet the definition of wireless, they can provide a redundancy to those systems that are wireless. However, the routing of cables, placement of phones, and the means used to harden the system must be carefully planned. Some companies are currently working on developing wireless devices that are capable of communicating over the existing phone system. At a minimum, the communication, tracking and AMS systems will likely be extended through the track entry, if present. This is where most leaky feeder systems are installed in mines today and where the highest reliability and best quality of service (QoS) is desired to be maintained. However, it is desired to provide system coverage in all entries of the mine; i.e., to provide reliable, high quality and survivable coverage in the belt entry and primary escape way as well as the track entry. Some of the options that the contractor may choose to include are: (1) propose to run leaky feeder in each entry, (2) install wireless mesh nodes in these areas, or (3) propose an alternative solution, perhaps employing antennas split off from entries containing leaky feeder or any other variation that will achieve the survivability objective. A particularly important aspect of system reliability is the availability of power via the emergency backup systems. This is a particularly difficult issue to address for systems that are used in underground coal mines. In a disaster situation, often times primary power has to be disconnected from the mine thus requiring that any post disaster system has to rely on battery back-up. The rescue operations can last for long periods of time. An added complication is that ventilation controls are often disrupted and therefore the atmosphere has to be treated as being potentially explosive due to methane. Therefore, systems survivability and reliability solutions must consider the trade off between battery life, survivability/reliability, and the potential of batteries of becoming potential ignition sources. The minimum survivability requirement is to identify areas within an underground mine where an accident could cut off communications to those in by and to provide an adequate level of hardening or redundancy to minimize such damage. Consider relevant mine-specific situations that might result in the loss of elements of the integrated communication and tracking infrastructure. For each unique situation consider what steps are needed to ensure survivability and/or provide for a redundant or alternative means of maintaining the communication and tracking capability. Situations of concern would include, but should not be limited to: Potential fire source areas Electrical equipment, motors, power centers, etc. Conveyor belts Underground shops Potential areas of explosive force pathways Intersections of sealed areas Intersections of completed sections Potential ground control failure areas Areas with potential roof problems Areas with potential rib problems Potential areas for impacts by mining equipment Travel ways Charging stations The contractor is encouraged to be creative and provide arguments for the development of any new or novel materials or techniques that can enhance equipment reliability and survivability. This requirement is being solicited as full and open competition. The CDC expects to award a single cost reimbursement plus fixed fee type contract, and the period of performance is expected to be approximately one year from date of award. The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at https://www.fbo.gov on or about May 1, 2008 and proposals will be due on or about May 31, 2008. All interested contractors are asked to identify themselves to the Contracting Office&rsquo;s Point of Contact listed in this announcement. It is the responsibility of perspective proposers to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site. No government-wide notes apply.</p>

<SUBJECT>Webportal for Adult English Learners
<SOLNBR>ED-08-R-0047
<RESPDATE>061908
<CONTACT>
<DESC><p>President Bush announced in August 2007, a series of initiatives to address border security and immigration challenges in the United States. The President's plan consists of 26 actions designed to secure the borders and to address needed immigration reforms. Number 26 of the plan states, "The Department of Education Will Launch A Free, Web-Based Portal To Help Immigrants Learn English, And Expand This Model Over Time. Knowledge of English is the most important component of assimilation. An investment in tools to help new Americans learn English will be repaid many times over in the contributions these immigrants make to our political discourse, economy, and society." The Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has created USA Learns (www.usalearns.org), an online learning environment, designed for low-level English Language Learners (ELL) to fulfill the President's promise. This project is authorized under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Title II of Public Law 105-220, Section 243, National Leadership Activities.
<p>OVAE developed a feasibility study for an adult education learner portal to help implement the president's proposal. As part of the feasibility study, developed under U.S. Department of Education contract number ED05CO0062, with the University of Michigan, ending on September 29, 2008, a prototype was constructed for low-level ELL students to provide OVAE with as much information as possible about what support adults require to be successful on-line learners. That contract, Strengthening Programs Through Technology, has produced a complete feasibility study and a web portal prototype, USA Learns.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Department requires a contractor to:<br />A. Maintain and expand functionality of USA Learns.<br />B. Expand access of USA Learns.<br />C. Maintain two self-assessment tools housed on www.adultedonline.org.<br />D. Report to the Department the progress of the USA Learns portal.</p>
<p>The Department plans for a period of performance of a base year with two one-year options. Further, a cost reimbursement with award fee type contract is contemplated. The Department will consider a Fixed Price or a Fixed Price with Award Fee offer.</p>
<p>The contractor shall propose the technical approach, the personnel and management plan necessary to accomplish this project. The contractor shall also coordinate with the National Institute for Literacy to accomplish the tasks. Deliverables shall include:<br />- A fully functioning website.<br />- A transition in plan from the old website to the new website.<br />- A transition out plan from the new website when the contract ends. <br />- A schedule of recommended updates. <br />- Self-Assessment tools for English Language Learners are made fully functional.<br />- Scheduled updates to the Department.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any comments on this pre-solicitation notice should be sent to the contacts provided. Please ensure that the name of the company, a point of contact, viable e-mail address, and telephone number are clearly indicated on your submission. Responses to questions will be posted to the following website: https://www.fbo.gov/. With the exception of written questions pertaining to this requirement, ED will not accept written correspondence, literature or other proposal-type submissions. The Department anticipates release of the RFP on or before May 20, 2008 with a closing date of June 19, 2008.</p>
<p>The contractor must possess the highest security clearance that the U.S. Department of Education requires: a background check for all employees involved with the portal. This acquisition will be a full and open competition. There will be subcontracting opportunities for small businesses and other socio-economic category businesses. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will require the submission of a technical proposal and a price proposal. Evaluation and award will be on a best value basis, cost and other factors (including past performance) considered. The solicitation will be issued via FEDBIZOPPS. NO PAPER COPIES will be mailed. All prospective contractors must be registered in the central contractors registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. When the solicitation is released, all responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the Department.</p>

<DESC>Air Conditioning Systems - Performance Based Logistics (ACS-PBL) Initiative.  The Defense Logistics Agency's PBL initiative is in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68-75, CVN 76 & 77 and planned for the CVN 78 Aircraft Carriers, located worldwide. See website:  www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/ACSPBL/index.html All updates and information concerning this project will be posted to website:  www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acspbl/index.html.  The closing of this RFI will be on Monday June 9, 2008.

Air Condition Plant Systems, Performance Based Logistics Initiative
ACPS ? PBL, Request for Information (RFI)

Request for Information:  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations as how best to define requirements for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solicitation/contract in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.   A future solicitation/contract would provide total support and management services in support of Aircraft Carriers located worldwide. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Background:  DSCC is the lead DLA center for maritime weapon systems.  DSCC is responsible for providing the Navy with the highest level of support, worldwide.  It is DLA?s goal to provide the best value to our military customer while reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  To meet our goals and future customer challenges, DSCC is continuing to benchmark with the private sector to determine which industry practices can be adopted to support the requirements of the Navy.  DSCC, in working with the Navy, has determined that a performance based contract would effectively support the warfighter.  Further review of the Navy PBL guide can be located at www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acps/index.html.

Description of Need:  DSCC- Maritime is soliciting information from industry in regards to comprehensive support and responsibilities for the Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine suitability of the commercial marketplace to meet the Statement of Objectives (SOO), Enclosure 1, to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support the possibility of a full and open competition requirement to satisfy objectives identified in the SOO.  DSCC- Maritime intends to use information resulting from the RFI responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, and performance specifications to be included in the RFP.

Objectives:  DSCC ? Maritime will utilize a full service PBL contract to enhance support of the Air Conditioning Plant Systems.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability.  DSCC will capture industry?s cost estimates for requirements that are listed in the SOO.  Addressing elements, which are described in the SOO, is essential in the RFI responses. 
 
The Government contemplates possibly issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a fixed price contract lasting10 ? years (2 year base with 8, one ? year options).  Estimated award date is 4th quarter FY 09.  Based on the results of a business case ?best value? analysis, DSCC ? Maritime, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple vendors.  Prospective vendors may respond to individual or all CLIN?s.

Responses:  Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages, single space.  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to the following:  
(A)	Company History:  A one page history to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) size classification; major products; and primary customer base.  Additionally RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Government?s consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for maintenance, supply support, training and all other services listed in the SOO.
(B)	Metrics:  Metrics recommended and methods to create and maintain a metrics database, for monitoring the performance of each functional area of the contract.  Also discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive/disincentive based contract award structure.  
(C)	Additional Information:  Technical or otherwise, the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment of the suitability of the commercial marketplace to accomplish sustainment of the subject AC plants.  The technical responses should address elements in the SOO.
(D)	Cost:  Vendor should provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) for elements addressed in the SOO.

Submission Information:  RFI responses shall be submitted no later than June 9, 2008 to DSCC ? Maritime, Attn:  FMGA (Laurie Gambert), ACS-PBL, 3990 East Broad St., Columbus OH  43218-3990.  Electronic responses are preferred and should be submitted to DSCC.ACSPBL@dla.mil.

Additional Information:  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to replace the previous synopsis for Thermal Magnetic Type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers Originally Manufactured by SPD Technologies which was initially issued on 01 April 2008. The revised synopsis is as follows:
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Philadelphia Office intends to procure fifteen (15) types (43 units in total) of thermal magnetic Type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers originally manufactured by SPD Technologies. Operational and performance requirements for both type of Circuit Breakers approved for use on Navy ships are contained in Military Specification MIL-DTL-7361G(SH). SPD Technologies is the only source that has successfully completed qualification testing for the Circuit Breakers covered by the proposed acquisition and is listed in QPL-17361-14 dated 28 April 2006 as the only qualified manufacturer. Since SPD Technologies discontinued production of thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers back in 2003, surplus or reconditioned circuit breakers will be acceptable due to the anticipated lack of new units. While in certain instances electronic circuit breakers have been found to be a suitable form, fit and functional replacement for a thermal magnetic circuit breaker, this is not the case for the type of AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers covered by the proposed acquisition. Due to the lack of replacement thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the proposed acquisition has been initiated to procure thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers originally manufactured by SPD Technologies in accordance with Military Specification MIL-DTL-17361G(SH).  These Circuit Breakers will be used to replace the failed units in the field and alleviate the impact of the obsolescence problems caused by SPD Technologies discontinuing the production of thermal magnetic type AQB and NQB Circuit Breakers. The Circuit Breakers to be procured shall be reconditioned items originally manufactured by SPD Technologies in accordance with Military Specification MIL-DTL-17361G(SH) dated 19 September 2006. The Circuit Breakers shall be reconditioned in accordance with NAVSEA Standard Item Number 009-75 dated 29 July 2004 including the performance of operational tests which require the close and trip of each circuit breaker electrically and manually from local and remote stations four (4) consecutive, successful times and ensure that the generator heater interlock is de-energized by the generator circuit breaker. 
A Firm Fixed Priced contract is anticipated. The Government intends to solicit this requirement as a 100% small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 423610. Interested parties may communicate their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The solicitation will be released on or about 16 May 2008 and will close thirty (30) days thereafter. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract among responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written requests can be submitted to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division Philadelphia Office, 5001 South Broad Street, Building 4, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403, Attn: John Stefano, Code 3352.

<SUBJECT>Alternative Non-Intrusive Inspection Technologies for Enhanced Screening and Inspection
<SOLNBR>RFI-08-00003
<RESPDATE>051608
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD) of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding alternative non-intrusive inspection (NII,) technologies for enhanced screening and inspection by the Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). 
Background:  Customs & Border Protection’s mission is to secure U.S. ports of entry from people and goods that are prohibited or which threaten U.S. citizens, infrastructure, resources and food supply, while efficiently facilitating legitimate trade and travel. TSA’s mission is to protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement of people and commerce.  Both CBP and TSA have a need to improve technologies currently being deployed for incoming cargo conveyance inspection and air cargo shipment inspection. Current NII technologies employed by CBP and TSA primarily consist of X-Ray and Gamma-Ray systems whose mission is to detect “traditional” contraband (i.e. drugs, currency, illegal firearms and high explosives) that may be illicitly smuggled in cargo containers and air shipping containers. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide CBP and TSA with technology with enhanced capabilities resulting in a greater confidence of detecting WMD, contraband, explosives, hidden compartments or stowaways during screening and examination of cargo.   
Objective:  For a research and development project that will be starting in FY 09, DHS S&T is seeking new and emergent technologies for a new type of NII system as well as emergent technologies that could augment existing NII systems. The purpose of this RFI is to investigate alternative approaches to non-intrusively inspect cargo and how this may be achieved through emerging technologies and/or current technologies, other than radiography, that can be applied in a different manner. This next generation system will significantly improve CBP’s and TSA’s capability to conduct non-intrusive screening and examination of ship, land and air cargo.

The key objective of this project is to advance research and development to:

•	Explore alternative, higher risk, non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies for scanning cargo for both high-density and low-density cargoes. These could include but are not limited to acoustic, infrared, ultra-wideband radar, millimeter wave, and other emergent or unknown or undiscovered technologies. Investigate non-traditional industries for scanning and imaging systems, such as the medical, space, undersea and industrial and manufacturing commercial markets.

•	Improve the system user’s ability to more confidently identify contraband and threat materials in ship, land and air cargo containers, by non-intrusively scanning both high-density and low-density cargo. 

•	Improve operational and maintenance costs, improve container throughput, reduction in weight of mobile NII systems, reductions in operator manpower due to automation, and increased sustainability of scanning equipment in extreme weather conditions and all-port environments.   

•	Minimize health and safety concerns of users and respective trucking and labor unions

Operational Concepts:  Ultimately, this project is intended to address the following CBP and TSA key security capability gaps:

•	Enhanced screening and examination of cargo by NII methods for WMD, contraband, hidden compartments or stowaway with improved resolution and throughput advanced non-intrusive inspection methods. 

•	Enhanced screening and examination of air cargo by advanced non-intrusive methods which will perform neutral to commodity type; to address inspection of air cargo container Unit Load Devices (ULD), bulk, and break bulk configurations.

•	Enhanced flexibility for NII systems to include fixed, mobile, and pallet screening devices

Notional Technical Objectives for an Alternative Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) System for Enhanced Screening and Inspection

Traditionally, the technical objectives for radiographic (x-ray and Gamma) NII systems have focused on the system’s capability in areas of penetration, resolution, contrast sensitivity, throughput and reliability. Alternative approaches that may improve screening and examination will be considered. 

Describe your technology improvements in the following areas based on the following technical objectives to scan high-density and low-density cargo:

•	Improvements in Penetration 

•	Improvements in Resolution

•	Improvements in Contrast Sensitivity

Or, describe the capability improvements your approach will offer to enable the system user to more confidently identify contraband and threat materials in ship, land and air cargo containers. Describe the technical objectives that will be achieved.

And, describe the technology’s capability to provide: 

•	Improvements in Throughput

•	Improvements in Reliability

•	Improvements in Image Quality

•	Reduction in the Total Number of Users Required to Operate the System

•	Improvements in Mobile System Weight

•	Improvements in Sustainability

•	Improvements in Health and Safety


 
RFI Submission Requirements:

Please include the following information in you submission: 

(1) Technical Approach: Describe your research and development approach to scanning associated with the automated inspection of vehicles, cargo, and cargo containers.

<SOLNBR>GS-10P-08-LT-D-0044
<CONTACT>
<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE/SYNOPSIS

The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  This will be a firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base performance period of one year and four one-year options.  The maximum aggregate amount of the MATOC program, inclusive of all awarded MATOC contracts, including options, shall not exceed $50 Million.  

The MATOC is intended for minimal design and construction efforts at various GSA facilities supported by the GSA Region 10, Western Service Center, located in Seattle, Washington.  Projects will be located in the western half of Washington to include the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area and the Northwestern Border Stations.  

Individual task orders awarded against the MATOC will be competed among other IDIQ awardees and will vary in size ranging from $2,000.00 to $2.59 Million (the 2008 prospectus limit).  Most task orders are anticipated to fall in the range of $25,000.00 to $250,000.00.  The Government anticipates awarding a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of seven (7) contracts.

The solicitation will be issued on a competitive basis and restricted as a Total Small Business set aside.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.

GSA intends to issue all documents to include the initial solicitation, amendments, clarifications letters and other applicable documents electronically.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 236220.  The small business size standard for this code is $31,000,000 in average revenue over the past 3 years.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 27, 2008.   Prospective contractors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for any changes or updates.  It is highly recommended that while viewing this synopsis on FedBizOpps, contractors register to receive notification of updates.
