<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground has a requirement for a Shock Tube System.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is W9124R-04-T-0029 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001- 20 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), 1998 Edition, current to DCN 2004-0323.  This acquisition is being solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code is 33419 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The resultant contract will be firm-fixed price.  It is anticipated that payment under this contract will be made via government VISA credit card.  Offeror s shall account for any costs associated with accepting credit card payment in their quote.  Quotes are being solicited for the following item:  CLIN 0001-1 EachÃ¢Â€Â“Shock Tube System that meet the following minimum specifications.  A conceptual illustrat ion of the system is posted at the following web address http://www.yuma.army.mil/contracting.  1.  Scope 1.1  Overall:  Design, fabricate, assemble, and deliver a safe, compressed air driven, portable, shock tube system.  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) will us e this system to produce frequent, controlled, repeatable shock waves in air.  YPG will use the shock impulses to test, check, and verify operation and dynamic characteristics of multiple high frequency pressure transducers such as piezoelectric and piezor esistive shock and blast gauges.  YPG will install the gauges flush along the shock tubes inside wall or located within the shock tube through the front end of the driven section.  The system shall be non-proprietary.  Rights to use the entire system conce pt, design, and production shall be open and unrestricted for the Contractor, U.S. Government, and any other responsible third party.  1.2  Description:  You shall build the system from commercially available products and components.  The system shall cons ist of metallic piping and structural shapes, actuators, controls, and related electrical and mechanical accessories.  The shock tube shall be based on two sections of pipe.  A replaceable rupture diaphragm physically separates a compressed air (driver) se ction and a lower pressure (driven) section.  See Appendix, Figure 1. for a conceptual illustration of a shock tube system.  The diaphragm is selected to isolate the two pipe sections and withstand a given pressure difference between the sections.  Further  increase of the pressure difference or actuation of a rupture device in the driver section bursts the diaphragm.  Rapid failure of the diaphragm and the resulting pressure change creates a compression shock wave that travels through the air in the driven section.  The design shall include safety lockout features and shall enable a single technician to safely load, seal, charge, and fire the system repetitively with a sustained rapid (objective of 90 seconds) cycle time.  Documentation shall include an oper ator's manual, wiring and fluid schematics, electrical and fluidic parts listings, and any OEM manuals and data sheets.  2. Requirements  2.1 Physical: 2.1.1 Dimensions.  YPG will house the system in an enclosure of limited size and layout with a standard entry door and prepared through-wall discharge opening.  System dimensional requirements shall be as follows: 	a.) Maximum allowable system length (unclamped and fully opened)Ã¢Â€Â“310 inches; b.) Maximum allowable system widthÃ¢Â€Â“32 inches; c.)	Maximum system height above floorÃ¢Â€Â“72 inches; d.) Tube centerline above floor-36 Ã‚Â±0.5 inches; e.) Driver and driven sections inside diameters equal and-11.5 Ã‚Â± 0.5 inches; f.)	Driver section chamber length-60 Ã‚Â±0.5 inches; g.) Driven section chamber length-240 Ã‚Â±1.0 inches; h.) Muzzle overhang beyond carriage and accessories-18 Ã‚Â±1.0 inches; i.) Muzzle flanges maximum diameter-20 inches.  2.1.2 Weight.  Typ ically one or a maximum of two technicians will be available to position the system for use.  Although overall system strength and rigidity is a primary goal, maximum feasible use of Aluminum alloy is desired to reduce system weight and allow mobility.  2. 1.3	Shock Tube Interior.  Production of repeatable shocks depends partly on the tube's interior that shall have the following characteristics: a.)	Tube walls shall be straight with no noticeable dents, curvature, or waviness along the length of the tube; b .) Tube interior surface shall be uniform with no large gouges, ridges, or flaws.  The surface roughness of a typical extruded tube, maximum 125 micro inches, shall be maintained throughout.  Honing may be used if needed to remove excessive roughness or im perfections.  2.1.4 Shock Tube Flanges.  Positive, reliable sealing and interior access for maintenance and placement of instrumentation require full diameter openings at the ends of the tube sections.  All shock tube sections shall be terminated and seale d leak-free using circular flanges.  a.)	Driver section back end shall be closed with a bolted standard template blind flange; b.) Driver section front and driven section rear clamping ends shall 1) Mate and align precisely together.  Alignment dowels or o ther effective means may be used if they do not interfere with the diaphragm material. 2) Secure the diaphragm in place and not cause its premature rupture. 3) Utilize a durable seal(s) that are reused and retained in position throughout repeated firing cy cles; c.) Driven section front end shall be flanged.  The flange shall be drilled for a standard template flange.  A duplicate drilled flange shall be installed six inches behind the front flange with front and duplicate flange bolt hole centerlines aligne d.  YPG intends to use both flanges in mounting probe and instrumentation brackets.  A blind flange shall be provided but not installed.  This blind flange shall be interchangeable with the driver section blind flange.  YPG will typically employ the system  open to atmosphere for incident shocks, but may in the future require the blind flange for reflected shock measurements.  Driven section front (muzzle) end flanges shall not exceed 20 inches in diameter.  2.1.5 Air Fittings.  All compressed air inlets, ou tlets, and gage ports on the driver section shall be through substantial 3/4 inch National Pipe Thread weldolet-type fittings.  2.1.6	Carriage.  A rigid, transportable carriage shall support the entire system.  The carriage shall also provide the following : a.) A captured, low friction trolley or other means of axial-only motion to support the driver section when it is fully opened and closed against the driven section.  The trolley shall support the driver at all movement locations, shall provide close ali gnment between the interface surfaces of the two tube sections, and shall not hinder precise alignment as clamping occurs; b.)	Castor type wheels with brakes and/or locks to prevent inadvertent movement or recoil of the system when in use; c.) If necessary , a means to adjust or correct the alignment of both tube sections; d.) Clearance near the tube for easy access to operational and maintenance fittings such as transducer gage ports and connectors, blow-down valve(s) or piping, and adjustment fasteners.  2 .1.7	Guard.  At setup for daily operations, YPG expects to position the system's muzzle about 18 inches through a wall opening.  If the system moves off course, installed transducers or their connectors could hit a concrete edge of the wall opening.  A tra nsducer guard/rail shall be attached alongside the tube at the muzzle end.  The guard shall be designed to allow access to the transducers and prevent the tube from contacting any forward transducers or their connectors against the wall opening.  2.1.8 Tools.  The system shall be fully usable and maintainable with standard commercial tools.  2.2	Functional: 2.2.1	Shock Generation Pressure.  The system shall operate leak-free with compressed air over a working pressure range of 1 to 100 psig in the driver section.  The driver section shall be designed with a safety factor appropriate for manned operation.  The  driver section shall be pressure tested and leak-free to at least 1.5 times the maximum allowable working pressure. 2.2.2	Clamping.  The system shall employ a powered, positive clamping method to join the tube sections and diaphragm layer(s) with a constant, repeatable force.  In addition, the clamping subsystem shall provide: a.) Precise alignment without causing prema ture or inconsistent rupture of the diaphragm; 	b.) Axial displacement of the driver to produce an access gap of not less than 5 inches across the clamping interface; c.) A means to adjust the applied clamping force; d.) A cycling (closed-opened-closed) ti me of not more than 4 seconds total repeated continuously over a tube firing cycle of once every 30 seconds.  e.) All actuators, controls, wiring, piping, power unit, and other accessories to make the system fully functional.  2.2.3 Diaphragm Cutter.  The system shall have a powered method of rupturing the diaphragm layer(s) over the system's operating pressure range.  Diaphragm materials will include rolled Mylar, paper, cellulose acetate and cellophane film and sheeting.  The rupturing subsystem shall cau se a very fast, wide-open tearing of the diaphragm to rapidly develop a compression shock front traveling along the driven tube.  The rupturing device shall be designed and located to minimize disturbance of the shock front.  In addition, the cutter shall automatically retract and remain so when it is deactivated.  2.2.4	Diaphragm Material Dispenser:  The system shall have a diaphragm material dispenser mounted conveniently near the driver-driven interface of the driven section.  The dispenser shall allow o ne technician to readily feed rolled diaphragm material to the interface and position it for clamping.  The feed path shall be direct and as parallel and close to the driven interface surface and as practical.  2.2.5 Transducer Ports.  For shock wave speed , pressure, and sonic speed measurements, 26 drilled and tapped gauge ports and 26 removable matching steel port inserts shall be installed in the tube near the muzzle end.  Twenty four (24) additional inserts shall also be provided for spares.  Port locat ions and details shall be as shown at the Appendix, Figure 2.  Overall, eight velocity ports and two thermocouple ports shall be oriented along the tube axis and 16 pressure ports shall be oriented circumferentially around the tube.  YPG will finish machin ing the port inserts to accommodate existing and future transducer bodies.  2.2.6 Controls.  Clamping, driver charging, and rupture functions shall be monitored and controlled by a portable, remote operator's control unit (OCU).  The operator's control uni t shall be connected to the system via a single umbilical control cable which is 10 to 12 feet long.  Control signals shall be 12 VDC that are supplied by a system power converter.  Additional control requirements follow: a.) Clamping subsystem lock-open a nd rupture device disable selector/switch on the system near the interface or other positive means for the technician to disable these features while working in the diaphragm clamping area; b.) Pressure indicator contact closure or separate pressure switch  interlock to prevent unclamping if the driver pressure is more than one psig; c.) Rapid charging to near desired pressure via a high flow rate poppet-type solenoid valve; d.) Fine pressure adjustment via a 3-way solenoid pneumatic control valve that provi des a more gradual charge or discharge of compressed air; e.) OCU - Key switch disable for all fu nctions; f.) OCU-Digital clamping force or pressure indicator; g.) OCU-Clamp open/close switch with safety cover; h.) OCU-Digital driver pressure indicator.  Range not to exceed 250 psig, uncertainty of Ã‚Â±0.2% full scale value or better; i.) OCU-Fast-fil l control switch with safety cover; j.) OCU-Pressure fine adjustment increase/decrease switch; k.) OCU-Fire switch with safety cover to actuate the diaphragm cutter.  2.2.7 Additional Safety Requirements.  Typical industry and OSHA safety standards shall a pply.  The driver section shall have a pressure gage and pressure relief valve.  The relief valve shall release at least 80 CFM at 120 psig.  A blow down valve shall discharge from the bottom of the tube.  System design and equipment selections shall avoid  sharp protrusions and edges, exposed hot or rotating parts, toxic or highly flammable substances. 2.2.8	Environmental.  YPG plans to house and use the system in a shelter/building.  The shock tube system shall function effectively under the following cond itions.  a.) Primary power supply-120 VAC, 15 A, single phase; b.) Compressed air source-125 psig, 60 CFM; c.) Storage temperature-20Ã‚ÂºF to 140Ã‚ÂºF; d.) Operating temperature-50Ã‚ÂºF to 110Ã‚ÂºF; e.) Relative humidity (non-condensing)-5% to 95% RH.  2.3 . Documentation:  You shall provide the following documentation.  The documentation may be combined in a single manual.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT 

Title:  Baseline Survey of Iraqi economy

C.1.0  Scope.  The rebuilding of Iraq requires an understanding of the current state of the economy, the education and training of its people, the more promising sources of future growth in economic activity and identifiable constraints on such growth.  This SOO seeks to survey various sectors countrywide to obtain a comprehensive baseline summary of the status of Iraq’s economy. This information will be used to determine the optimal programs to support economic growth in the economy of Iraq.

C.1.1  Background.  The economy of Iraq has suffered from corruption and neglect for decades. The loss of public funds for education and vocational training has reduced the general level of education of the populace. Many industrial processes and equipment are antiquated.  Moreover, skills and knowledge levels have fallen behind much of the rest of the world. 

C.1.2  Overall Objective.   The purpose of this contract is to gather and analyze data on all aspects of Iraq’s economy.  A contractor will hire and administer at least 20 economists resident throughout Iraq, who will work together with their colleagues nationwide and within the Coalition Provisional Authority  or its successor organization (hereinafter “CPA”), under guidance of the CPA project coordinator, to provide an overview  of economic activity in Iraq.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to remove the requirement for compliance with the Berry Amendment and to post questions and answers.

1.  Does the Institute of Heraldry have dies and tools or do we have to make them?
I called but cannot reach Stan Haas, only his mail box.

The Institute of Heraldry has no hubs or dies for these medals.

 
2.  Enameling: Your specs say Hard enameling but some of your numbers are hard
stoned epoxy. The institute accepts hard stoned epoxy for all military emblems and medals.
Can we quote hard stoned epoxy?
 
Enameling can be hard fired enameling or hard stoned epoxy

3.  Bravery medal:  Is the lug part of the medal or separate?
Eagle in triangle seams to be in relief. When stoning the hard enamel it will become flat (2D) 

The lug for the Bravery medal is part of the medal.  The background in the triangle is red enamel with the eagle in relief.  The background behind the swords is black enamel.  The entire circle is covered with a clear epoxy material.  The outer rays are beveled.

 
4.  Liberation medal.  Is the attachment of the medal to the ribbon a separate piece, which attaches to the loop of the medal?
 
The attachment of the medal to the ribbon is a separate piece which attaches to the loop of the medal.

5.  Wound medal: The red back ground of the Star, the rays seem to be beveled. That would be
sprayed enamel. Or is it flat so that it can be hard enameled? Is this a 2 piece medal or one piece?  What is the finish.? There are no specs for this medal on the web, only for the ribbon.
Is the ribbon a ribbon drape like the other medals or a neck ribbon?  Attachment of the ribbon drape: can be 2 nail bar with clutches, or side loading safety catch or fusion catch, top loading?

The red background rays are beveled and sprayed with a red matte finish enamel.  The medal is one piece.  The star is matte gold.  The ribbon does not have a traditional drape.  It is folded as shown on the drawing and sewn to the ribbon ring with no attaching device

6.  Do the medals have to be made in the USA.

No.

7.  What does “supporting information for proposed items that demonstrates they understand the specifics stated in the description mean and entail?

It means that you must supply enough information on how YOU would produce the item, so that it is clear to the contracting officer that the offeror understands the requirement.
