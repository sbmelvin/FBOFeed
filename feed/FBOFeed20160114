<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for IT Modernization Work Package 2 (WP2) - Supply of Client Equipment and Accessories. Under the contract, a catalogue of client equipment and accessories will be established against which the NCI Agency will place orders for delivery to NATO sites in support of the implementation of the IT Modernization project.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14210-ITM and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>The successful bid pursuant to the IFB will be the bid that is the lowest price and technically compliant in accordance with the evaluation criteria prescribed in the IFB.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The WP2 Contractor will be responsible for the supply and delivery of client equipment and accessories to the sites, but the integration into the IT infrastructure will be done by another contractor (ITM WP1 Contractor). The different types of client equipment and accessories to be included in the catalogue along with their technical specifications will be described in the Statement of Work. For more information, please see the attachment.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>

<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, (CSELS) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to Spark Holland Inc., 816 N. Delsea Dr., Ste. 376, Glassboro, NJ 08028-1438, for maintenance services of Spark Holland instruments.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for Spark Holland to provide annual preventative and remedial maintenance services for the Symbiosis SPE system (a solid phase extraction unit and an autosampler). Spark Holland Inc. is the only manufacturer of the Symbiosis SPE system. Therefore, the company can provide the best service for the maintenance and repairs of the instruments. To our knowledge, the Symbiosis SPE system from Spark Holland Inc. is the only equipment system capable of automatically exchanging the SPE cartridges in a way that is completely synchronized with the operation of the HPLC pump and mass spectrometer data collection. The exchange of cartridges is needed to ensure validity of the analytical results because of the complexity of the serum matrix. The equipment provides an on-line solid phase extraction. On-line SPE systems without the capability to automatically exchange SPE cartridges are not suitable for measuring chemicals in serum, due to high protein and lipid content.</p>
<p>Spark Holland Inc. is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements because they are the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only company capable of maintaining the Symbiosis SPE system. Spark Holland's trained engineers periodically receive service information and updates consisting of a compilation or recent problems and suggested methods of correction. These service information reports are only distributed to the personnel trained and actively employed by Spark Holland Inc.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will issue only one solicitation to Spark Holland Inc. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov NO LATER THAN 5:30pm EST on January 29, 2016. Reference solicitation number 2016-N-17721 in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and is solely in the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract action in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.2.4 to SRA International Inc. of Fairfax, VA for Cyber Security Management Center (CSMC) Security Operations Center (SOC) support services. This award will be a bridge contract action. The current contract DTFAWA-08-C-00142 provides support through 29 February 2016. The purpose of the bridge contract action is to avoid a discontinuation of services while planning for a new competitive procurement. After a cyber-event took place in 2015, the FAA has been working to improve upon the cybersecurity requirements for the follow-on competition to ensure the FAA is afforded the appropriate level of protection for continued operations.  As the current contract expires on February 29, 2016, this action will provide continued performance for  six (6) months with an option period of three (3) additional months, with the optional period anticipated to have a POP end date of 30 November 2016.  This will allow time for final approvals on the follow-on competitive package, release of the RFP, and award of the contract with an adequate transition period.

Although a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement at this time, the FAA anticipates releasing the RFP within February 2016. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement. Any questions or comments about this announcement must be directed to Stephanie Taylor at Stephanie.a.taylor@faa.gov. All inquiries must be submitted in writing. Phone calls will not be entertained.

Specific databases include BTRIS, REDCap,  and the NICHD's CTDB. Knowledge and experience working with the NIH Clinical Center's CRIS medical records systems is required.  The contractor must possess working knowledge of these systems as there is no staff available to provide the training in these systems under the funds obligated via this contract; any such work required to become familiar with these systems would be required to be independently undertaken at the contractor's personal expense and time. This contract is proposed to be offered to Dr. Michael Ring as he is already very trained and knowledgeable about these required systems.  In addition, through his current and previous experience working with NIDDK's DIR investigators, he is already familiar with the varied study designs and data management requirements for many of the NIDDK clinical research protocols and will not require additional time to meet with investigators to assess current data management use and future needs.</p>
<p>Duty Station:<br />All services rendered shall be performed in support of NIDDK clinical research initiatives at the NIH Clinical Center on the National Institutes of Health's main campus in Bethesda, MD and other NIDDK study performance sites.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on that Dr. Michael Ring possess a medical<br />doctorate in order to be fully conversant with the clinical investigator's data management and system specification needs. Dr. Ring is qualified for this role, has the required knowledge and is already familiar with NIDDK DIR clinical protocols, providing a maximum efficiency for consultations with on-going and new projects.</p>
<p>In compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source.  This solicitation is not a Small Business Set-Aside. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the <br />discretion of the Government.  It is anticipated that the RFQ NICHD2016009 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis. Receipt of quotations will be due five (5) days after the release of the RFQ.

The solicitation, as planned, will be a 100 percent set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is 541690. The Product Service Code is B599. The required services are to be provided during a base year, starting the effective date of contract award, and additionally, during any and all option years as exercised by the Government. The exercise of an option requires a Determination by the Contracting Officer. Only the base year will be funded upon award of the contract.
 With options exercised (requiring funding to be added incrementally), the total term of the contract will not exceed 60 months. The Contracting Officer anticipates an award of a contract no later than February, 2016. The pre-award scheduled includes the posting of a Solicitation to the FedBizOpps website in late September or October, 2015. If a small business wants to indicate to the Navy, during the presolicitation phase, its specific capabilities for the required services, communication to the contact person identified for this Synopsis is encouraged. Such communication may include identification of any socio-economic certifications or other designations relevant to federal acquisition and inclusion of both the DUNS number and CAGE code for the business is encouraged.
  NOTE: the capture and ongoing use or targeting of the email address for the Navy contact person for future digital marketing and promotions is strongly discouraged.
  
BACKGROUND

The Navy Geothermal Program Office (GPO), NAVFAC EXWC code PW68, is the Department of Defense lead agency for geothermal exploration, development, and resource management. The Coso geothermal field is located at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), China Lake, California. The GPO is co-located at China Lake. GPO is within the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC). The GPO is code PW68 within EXWC. The EXWC command is located at Port Hueneme, California, where the Acquisitions Department (ACQ) is located.
 The EXWC code for the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist supporting the GPO acquisition requirements is ACQ71. A completed contract, N62473-13-M-4624, had a requirement similar to the one described in this Presolicitation (Synopsis). A gap of several months has occurred between the completion of N62473-13-M-4624 and the current pre-award effort by the Navy to ensure a new contract is awarded for the ongoing Geochemistry of Coso requirement.
 
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED

The requirements described below shall build on and extend beyond the work previously accomplished under purchase order N62473-13-M-4624. The requirements will be presented as a Performance Work Statement in the Solicitation and the contract as awarded.
 
Requirement 1: Update the fluid-geochemistry database

The Contractor shall update the established GPO Coso geothermal field fluid-geochemistry database (MS Access-based) of all geochemical analyses from brine and gas samples collected in the field to date.
 The Contractor shall both compile and evaluate the quality of the new data using established Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/AC) protocols, or equivalent with prior Navy approval. The Contractor shall recommend and establish (with Government approval) additional QA/QC protocols for new analyses as they are added to the GPO Coso database. The geothermal database includes analytical results such as major constituents, minor and trace element constituents, gaseous species and isotopes, and standard chemical measurements such as Eh, pH, and TDS, and shall be obtained from the GPO. Since the vast majority of emergent geochemical data will come from the Coso geothermal development contractor (COC), under contract to the Navy, evaluation of the quality of these data will allow the Contractor to assess the COC sampling and analytical protocols and procedures.
 The Contractor shall recommend modifications to the geochemical monitoring program of the Coso geothermal contractor ( a party under contract with the Navy), as appropriate to ensure the program is maintained at or above geothermal industry standards for a geothermal resource of this type and magnitude (see Requirement 3, below). The Contractor shall perform field health and fluid augmentation monitoring and providing recommendations for geochemical sampling techniques and process at the Coso geothermal field. The Contractor shall gather and analyze extant and emergent geochemical and isotopic data to monitor the geochemistry of the Coso geothermal system. The purpose of this effort is to provide a geochemical expertise that the Navy does not possess internally, expertise that is a critical component of the GPO program that protects the Navy equity in the Coso geothermal resource.
 The Contractor shall continue the compilation and evaluation of all Coso geothermal system geochemical analyses from brine and gas samples, including a variety of gaseous species and isotopes. Based on evaluation of these data, the Contractor shall assess the operational sampling and analysis protocols and procedures currently in use at Coso. The Contractor shall recommend modifications to these protocols and procedures, as appropriate to ensure the program is maintained at or above geothermal industry standards. The Contractor shall provide findings and recommendations in a detailed report to the Government for the base year of the contract and also for each option year that is exercised.

Requirement 2: Perform Geothermal field health and fluid augmentation monitoring

The Contractor shall perform field health and fluid augmentation monitoring and providing recommendations for geochemical sampling techniques and process at the Coso geothermal field.
 The Contractor shall conduct enthalpy monitoring of the reservoir geochemistry with changes in fluid flow characteristics and wellhead and subsurface pressure/temperature data provided by the GPO and COC. Such monitoring shall be conducted on both a field-wide and individual well basis. The Contractor shall use geochemical data to examine and predict reservoir effects of various injection fluids, such as: cold water augmentation, hot production fluids, cool/cold production fluids, cool steam condensate, concentrated brine, brackish local groundwater, and low TDS groundwater.  A significant component of Requirement 2 will be a focus on the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the Coso geothermal fluids through the utilization of a variety of noble gas and stable isotopes.
 
Requirement 3: Provide Recommendations

The Contractor shall investigate and recommend new techniques and processes, which will contribute to the understanding within the Navy regarding the geochemistry of the Coso geothermal system, particularly the relationship of reservoir injected fluids to host rock, source rock, heat source, reservoir conduits (plumbing), water augmentation, other physical parameters, and time.


DELIVERABLES

Reporting requirements will be provided in the Solicitation.
 The Navy will include a Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) as an attachment to the Solicitation and the contract award, for the specification of due dates, subject matter, and other details as applicable for requisite reports.
 
MEETINGS AT THE GPO, CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA 

The Solicitation will identify the plan for any meetings that the GPO intends to hold with the Contractor present.

<p>Issue Date: 14 JAN 2016 - Closing Date: 29 JAN 2016 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for a high speed digital SOC and radio frequency (RF) capable test platform. The SOC test system shall be a replacement for an existing Advantest Verigy 93K test system. The new system must be capable of testing to specification all past components using the preexisting hardware from the old Advantest Verigy 93K Single Density system and have the additional capability of testing RF components. See attached draft specification to review the technical requirements provided as attachment 1 to this document. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Advantest America Inc., 3061 Zanker Road San Jose, CA 95134, (CAGE 0P925). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition to the Advantest 93K test system is to avoid roughly $4.7M in cost duplication and prevent as much as six years unnecessary schedule impact. The Government expended considerable effort and expense to develop the current testing capabilities consisting of hardware and software development, development of test procedures, configuration management and anti-counterfeit/anti-tamper hardware and software development. The estimated cost to restore capability if a different test system is procured is projected to be roughly $4.7M higher than the proposed cost to convert capability if a new Advantest 93K test system is procured.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government's requirement and qualification requirements for high speed digital SOC and radio frequency (RF) capable test platforms may respond. Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $4.7 million in cost duplication and the schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the significant Government investment in the existing Advantest Verigy 93K test system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-16-R-GM47</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement. The POC for this effort is Mr. Darren Devido, darren.devido@navy.mil or 812-854-2894. The mailing address is:</p>

Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of

conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the  
on-line auction, offeror's proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other  
offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public

disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed 
from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only

generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing   
(e.g.,"Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation,   
offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may  
be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. 
An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final price proposal

revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse

Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are

needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR  
15.307. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal

Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists (QPLs), Qualified Product
Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents from the

source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The

as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification 
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having

jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item

requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is

flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined

adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the

source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been

solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that 
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an  
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information   
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source

Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx 
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data 
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your 
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source

approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source 
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the   
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this

solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted 
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the 
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award  
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP

The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to attain the following objectives:</p>
<p>a. Software development, test, training, and ICS after fielding of TACP CASS Software Version 2.0, with backwards compatibility and interoperability to previous TACP CASS Software Versions.</p>
<p>b. Competition, innovation, and modernization of the current CASS software that will be utilized on a several platforms: handheld and wearable tablets, vehicular-mounted tablets or laptops, and computers located at Air Support Operation Centers (ASOC) and Tactical Operation Centers (TOC).</p>
<p>c. Developed software will be Government owned and thus will not incorporate proprietary protocols, libraries, etc. unless those proprietary Intellectual Properties (IP) have unlimited rights and are approved by the Government.</p>
<p>d. Developed software shall greatly emphasize a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) facilitating updates, replacements, and enhancements of any individual module in the software.</p>
<p>e. Developed software shall greatly emphasize speed using optimization technology, protocols or message formats for low bandwidth networks (i.e. efficient xml).</p>
<p>f. Develop software required for Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) dialogs with CAS aircraft and current and future publish/subscribe versions of adjacent US Army and US Air Force systems</p>
<p>g. Deliver TACP CASS Software Version 2.0 to meet Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of 4QFY19.</p>
<p>The TACP-M program develops and fields CASS mission software integrated with laser targeting devices, radio systems, and various joint/service C2 systems to transmit air requests, access battlefield situation awareness information, coordinate CAS missions with ground forces, and provide terminal attack control for CAS missions. The TACP-M system interfaces to aircraft equipped with Air Force Application Product Development (AFAPD); Variable Message Format (VMF); and Marine Tactical System (MTS) Protocol digital communications systems. ASOC Gateway interfaces allow communications with data link gateways equipped with Joint Range Extension (JRE) software for communication with Link-16 or Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) equipped strike aircraft.</p>
<p>The specific operational and technical requirements for CASS Software Version 2.0 will be described in a draft System Requirements Document (SRD) that will be available for industry review closer to CASS 2.0 RFP release date.

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation, but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only. This Sources Sought is a follow-up to FA8232-14-R-MWS, FA8232-14-R-MWS2, and FA8232-14-R-MWS3.
<p>1.1 This Sources Sought Synopsis is not intended to direct or influence any financial or resource investment from industry vendors. No financial obligations or commitments with or to the Government should be inferred.</p>
<p>1.2 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which have a corresponding Size standard of 750 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>2. Program Details:</p>
<p>2.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) have a requirement for a Missile Warning System (MWS) for their F-16 aircraft. AFRC and ANG seek an MWS solution with the following key characteristics:</p>
<p>a)Passive, automated protection capabilities against missile/projectile threats to F-16 aircraft, to include man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADs)</p>
<p>b)Simultaneously perform with near-100% Probability of Declaration (PDEC) and near-zero False Alarm Rate (FAR)</p>
<p>c)Integration into Pylon Integrating Dispenser System Universal (PIDSU), a wing-mounted pylon system, with near-4&pi; steradian threat coverage of the F-16</p>
<p>d)Non-developmental system with proven high speed aircraft or proven tactical aircraft performance, preferably on F-16 aircraft</p>
<p>2.2 All Government communications (previous or current) regarding the AFRC and ANG MWS program, including Sources Sought Synopses, Requests for Information (RFIs) and Industry Days, should not be construed to establish a specific requirement for any components, subsystems, or capabilities.</p>
<p>3. Information Requested:</p>
<p>3.1 As part of its market research for the F-16 MWS program, the F-16 Program Office (AFLCMC/WWMB), Hill AFB, UT is seeking information and/or recommendations from industry. If your company or organization is interested in this potential contract, please address the following topics:</p>
<p>a)Can you provide a PDEC-FAR correlation table for system performance in the F-16 operational (or similar) environment?</p>
<p>b) AFRC and ANG do not have funding to support developmental systems. In order to validate system performance and maturity, source qualification and/or source validation test data may be required with each system proposal. The F-16 SPO is considering the use of a USAF laboratory facility to independently verify system performance. While AFRC and ANG may fund laboratory activities for this purpose, there are no plans to purchase vendor system(s) for qualification/validation test(s). Any system brought into the USAF laboratory may be subject to security and/or export restrictions. Is your organization willing to provide MWS hardware (anticipated to be two to three MWS sensors and one controller) for this purpose? What other hardware or software assets would be required to support testing of your system in the Government laboratory facility? Does your organization have production-representative hardware available for laboratory testing at this time? If not, when would production-representative hardware for testing become available?</p>
<p>c) AFRC and ANG have invested heavily in PIDSU, and have interest in integrating any potential MWS solutions into these pylons. These pylons would be made available for upgrade to a MWS pylon configuration. AFRC and ANG desire to maintain all current PIDSU pylon functionality once MWS is installed. Does your organization's MWS pylon solution maintain all current PIDSU capabilities and functionalities? If not, what capabilities and functionalities are expected to change?</p>
<p>d) In order to verify MWS integration into a PIDSU pylon, the F-16 SPO may require that production-representative PIDSU pylon prototypes, including MWS hardware, be provided along with proposals. Does your organization have production-representative MWS-integrated pylon prototypes? If not, when would production-representative MWS-integrated pylon prototypes be available?</p>
<p>e) Does your organization possess the data rights and intellectual properties needed to manufacture your MWS pylon? If not, what organization or company holds the data rights and intellectual properties for your MWS pylon?</p>
<p>f) AFRC and ANG envision an MWS pylon flying on each wing of the F-16. Due to current aircraft physical limitations, it may not be possible for USAF to add wires that directly connect the two pylons. The following wiring will be provided to connect each pylon to the F-16 countermeasures controller:</p>
<p>&bull; Power on discrete</p>
<p>&bull; Ready/Keep Alive discrete</p>
<p>&bull; Threat declaration discrete</p>
<p>&bull; MIL-STD-1553 bus (with the F-16 countermeasures controller as the bus controller)</p>
<p>Given these constraints, no direct communication between pylons will be available. This leads to an expectation of an independent MWS in each pylon. The F-16 countermeasures controller can receive threat data (e.g. angle of arrival, time to go/time to intercept, etc.) over the 1553 bus from each pylon. The F-16 countermeasures controller will process this threat data and coordinate aircraft responses.</p>
<p>Can your organization provide a successful MWS solution given the system configuration above? If so, describe your envisioned system architecture. Please identify bandwidth impact to the 1553 bus. What capabilities would this system provide? Does your system offer other capabilities that would not be supported by the configuration above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>g) Given the constraints in Paragraph 3.1.f, does your organization see any alternatives to an independent MWS in each pylon? If so, describe your envisioned system architecture. Please identify bandwidth impact to the 1553 bus. What capabilities would this system provide? Please compare these alternatives with the architecture in Paragraph 3.1.f. Which solution, if any, do you recommend? Please explain your rationale.</p>
<p>h) If additional aircraft wiring must be provided (e.g. wing-to-wing wiring) beyond the configuration described in Paragraph 3.1.f, what are the minimum number, size, and type of wires that would be required for MWS operation? Describe your envisioned system architecture for this configuration. What capabilities would this system provide? Government wiring costs (including material and labor) to support proposed system configurations may be evaluated with each contract proposal (i.e. potential impact to proposal cost).</p>
<p>i) Has the performance of your organization's MWS been demonstrated in the F-16 operational (or similar) environment on a PIDSU pylon? If not, what modifications have been made to your MWS hardware and/or software to make your system suitable for operation in an F-16 PIDSU pylon? Have these modifications adversely affected your system's Technology Readiness Level (TRL)? What is your system's assessed TRL?</p>
<p>j) There is wing flex and twist in the F-16 resulting in relative movement of up to 10 degrees between the fuselage and each pylon, and 20 degrees between sensors on opposite wing stations. For the architecture(s) envisioned in Paragraphs 3.1.f, 3.1.g and/or 3.1.h, please assess how the following concerns impact your system's performance:</p>
<p>&bull; Movement of pylons relative to F-16 Enhanced GPS/INS (EGI) data</p>
<p>&bull; Movement of pylons relative to each other, particularly the effect on any sensor overlap regions; due to wing flex and twist, sensor overlap regions will be dynamic</p>
<p>k) What Support Equipment is required for 1) Operational Maintenance/Support, 2) Intermediate Maintenance/Support, and 3) Depot Maintenance/Support of your system? USAF strongly prefers to utilize common USAF Support Equipment (i.e. already in USAF inventory). Can you identify common USAF Support Equipment that is compatible with your system (e.g. MEON)?</p>
<p>l) As a potential USAF weapons system, maintenance, sustainment and support of the F-16 Missile Warning System must be accomplished in US facilities by appropriately cleared personnel. Is your system produced (hardware and software) in the United States? If USAF acquires your system and requires future support or updates, will these requirements be fulfilled exclusively in the United States? In supporting your system, does your organization depend on any technical expertise residing outside of the United States? If your system was originally designed outside of the United States, has your organization taken any steps to acquire the technical and intellectual knowledge necessary to support the system entirely within the United States?</p>
<p>m) Cybersecurity (CS, formerly Information Assurance), to include Anti-Tamper, will be integral in the acquisition, integration and fielding of the F-16 Missile Warning System. To appropriately assess a system's vulnerabilities (if selected), detailed understanding of the system's design architecture and components will be required by USAF. This data would be analyzed for CS purposes only. Would your organization be able and willing to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Detailed system architectural data;</p>
<p>&bull; Supply chain pedigree for electronic components used to manufacture your system;</p>
<p>&bull; Functional data flows and usage within the system?</p>
<p>Does your organization have experience with USAF/DoD CS processes? Does your organization have experience implementing CS vulnerability mitigation measures on complex electronic systems? Please provide any specific examples.</p>

The government would not be able to take the specialized tooling away from General Dynamics without interfering with the C-130J production. No other company can produce the Nose Radome Assembly as they would need access to the tooling on loan to General Dynamics. Although Nose Radome Assembly were previously purchased from Lockheed Martin (PN 3333921-1, CAGE 98897), they were manufactured by General Dynamics (PN 333392-1, CAGE 04DG4). The most recent market research reveals that the Nose Radome Assembly could be purchased directly from General Dynamics without having to go through Lockheed. Each of these companies maintains their configuration by part number. The Government does not own any data, drawings, schematics, or any other releasable technical data in support of this requirement. As a result, General Dynamics is the only known source with adequate knowledge of the Nose Radome Assembly requirements and have in possession the required technical data and capabilities needed to produce this item and ensure compatibility of the equipment. </span></p>

<DESC>Subject: Request for Information for Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Increment 1, 4th Generation Long Term Evolution Cellular Transmission Systems <br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM WIN-T) Increment 1 (Inc 1) seeks industry feedback regarding Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) 4th Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE) cellular transmission systems, a component of the Signal Modernization Program to transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes. The cellular transmission capability must be fully accredited to transport data from multiple security enclaves. LandWarNet capabilities will be augmented through the employment of a deployable cellular transmission system that provides extension for mission command information, to include voice, possibly sensor information, and data to command elements and unit leaders. The cellular transmission infrastructure will provide network extension and flexibility once connected to the tactical network (WIN-T) and possibly to the Soldier level. This capability will be remotely configured, managed and monitored by organic S6/G6 sections and manpower. Cellular capabilities will have cell towers at select network assemblages to provide coverage per local commander's priorities. It shall also potentially be leveraged to provide connections to other wireless systems or enable intelligence capabilities [i.e., Relevant ISR at the Edge (RITE)] to provide extended network range and coverage for Army units.</p>
<p>The cellular modernization capability shall provide data transport, which is integrated, interoperable, and certified to connect to WIN-T networks for network extension (Threshold); provide cellular data transport interoperable with Special Operations Forces (SOF) communications systems and commercial communications architectures for network extension (Objective).<br />This capability will augment the network by bringing tactical single enclave network connectivity to disadvantaged users using cellular data devices fielded at the tactical formation. It shall allow Warfighters to communicate between cellular data devices and specially equipped tactical vehicles outfitted with a cellular base station. These base stations shall be connected to terrestrial transmissions and also to the WIN-T and theater networks. At this time, cellular data devices are not currently supported by WIN-T either while on the move or at the halt. The lack of this capability has been identified as a critical gap in communications that has currently been met by quick reaction capabilities (QRC) systems utilizing commercial off-the-shelf technologies. Incorporating this modernization capability into future WIN-T enabled capability sets will produce a permanent solution that directly links disadvantaged Soldiers at the tactical formation with their expeditionary information network.</p>
<p>PM WIN-T Inc 1 seeks industry feedback regarding availability of a production 4G LTE cellular system that will meet the requirements of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) description included herein. Respondents to this RFI will have the opportunity, if desired, to demonstrate their systems for informal analysis and evaluation in the WIN-T Lab in Building 6010, APG, MD.</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>All submissions in response to this RFI shall include company names, Point of Contact to include, name, position, telephone number and email address. Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI on or before 02 Feb 2016, 1600 Eastern Daylight Time. All responses shall be transmitted electronically to the Contracting Officer, joann.m.mazza.civ@mail.mil, Contract Specialist, colleen.p.dodd.civ@mail.mil and Project Leader, Andre Wiley at andre.l.wiley3@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with product brochures and/or capability statements as well as delivery lead time. All submissions should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 or a compatible format. Responses to this RFI shall be unclassified. Telephone or verbal inquiries regarding this notice will not be honored. All restricted information SHALL be clearly marked. All documentation submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their response to this RFI.<br /><br />See attachment for diagram&emsp;</p>

<CONTACT>Ronald P. Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone 9072286244, Email rpsmith@fs.fed.us
<DESC><p>ANAN BAY MOORING FLOAT<br />PRELIMINARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This sources sought is used to conduct market research to determine if any qualified small businesses are interested and capable of performing this project.</p>
<p>Interested prime contractors are requested to respond concerning their interest and asked to submit a statement of your capabilities to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The project would construct a mooring float that accommodates two Beaver floatplanes, two 32 foot long boats, two 27 foot long boats and one 16 foot long skiff on a pull-out ramp inset into the float. The float dimensions would be approximately 90 feet long and 30 feet wide with a deck height of around 18 inches above the water. Decking would be wood or fiberglass, depending on the budget.</p>
<p>The proposed float would be anchored (no piling or shore connection) with a system suitable for the depth and bottom characteristics. The anchoring for the existing administrative float house and the small float for cabin users would be renewed as part of this project to minimize future maintenance and complexity.</p>
<p>The mooring float and the administrative floathouse would be towed to Wrangell for storage in the winter.</p>
<p>LOCATION<br />Anan Wildlife Observatory approximately 30 air miles from Wrangell, Alaska.<br />The proposed mooring float would be located in the bight along the north shore of Anan Bay, near the current seasonal location of the USFS administrative floathouse and the Anan Bay Recreation Cabin. The existing administrative floathouse and the small float for cabin users will be repositioned in the same bight in an arrangement that best fits the site.</p>
<p>PROCESS<br />It is anticipated that marine conditions and design criteria will be provided to contractors, along with the design of the proposed locations and anchoring systems for the three floats, anchoring connections and towing connections. A design concept and description of the mooring float will be provided to contractors to obtain the mooring float as a commercial product.</p>

<DESC>On or about January 15, 2016, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is releasing a Draft Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) for community review and comment, soliciting Cycle 2 proposals for the submission of multi-institutional team-based proposals for research as participating members of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). This draft CAN has been designated NNH16ZDA002J and will be available via the NSPIRES web page at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>  , see below. <p> The goal of this CAN is to foster an innovative, broadly based research program addressing basic and applied research fundamental to understanding the nature of the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and the near space environments of these target bodies, to enable human exploration of these destinations. However, nondestination targets, such as the study of comets and/or main-belt asteroids, may provide critical information relating to the origin and evolution of the proposed target bodies. Therefore, comparative planetary investigations that include comets and/or main-belt asteroids are within the scope of this CAN. Proposed research that complements current Institute Teams, or addresses important research areas not currently covered in the Institute, will also be given strong consideration (see: <A HREF="http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/">http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/ </A>  ). Proposals in the areas of astrophysics and heliophysics that are enabled through human and robotic exploration of the Target Bodies are also solicited through this Cooperative Agreement Notice. <p> The issuance of this Draft CAN does not obligate NASA to issue the CAN and solicit proposals. Issuance of the Final CAN is dependent on programmatic factors, including NASA receiving an appropriation and operating plan containing adequate funding within the Science Mission Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate budgets. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to the Final CAN are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk. The final SSERVI CAN2 may contain provisions that differ from this Draft CAN, in which case those in the final CAN take precedence. <p> The text of this draft CAN will be available on or about January 15, 2016, via NSPIRES at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>	by selecting Solicitations, choosing "Open" from the bulleted list on the left under "View Solicitations" and then searching on NNH16ZDA002J <p> All comments and questions must be submitted by February 12, 2016, via email to Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, Director of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute, at <a href="mailto:yvonne.pendleton@nasa.gov">yvonne.pendleton@nasa.gov </a> and cc <a href="mailto:gregory.schmidt@nasa.gov">gregory.schmidt@nasa.gov </a>  and <a href="mailto:brad.bailey@nasa.gov">brad.bailey@nasa.gov </a> . The character string "SSERVI CAN2" (without quotes) should be included in the subject line. The identity of those submitting comments will be held in confidence. Answers to questions about this Draft CAN will be made available on the NSPIRES website (<A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com">http://nspires.nasaprs.com </A>  ). <p> Schedule: Due date for comments on Draft CAN	February 12, 2016 Release of Final CAN (target):	March 2016 Step-1 Proposals Due:	No less than 30 days after Final CAN release Step-2 Proposals Due:	90 days after Final CAN release <p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />
<p>1.0	Project Title</p>
<p>Commercial Air Operations (CAO) Travel Management Services</p>
<p>2.0	Description</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) in support of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and the ICE Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is seeking information and feedback from interested travel management companies (TMC) for a possible upcoming procurement.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.</p>
<p>This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, ICE is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or capability statements.  Vendors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>If a solicitation is released, it will be posted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advance Planning Forecast System (APFS) website.  It is the responsibility of potential vendors to monitor the APFS for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3.0	Background</p>
<p>ICE Air Operations (IAO), a division of the DHS ICE ERO Removal Division, provides aviation support for the transport of aliens ordered removed from the United States.  IAO is comprised of two units:  Commercial Air Operations (CAO) and Air Charter Operations (ACO).  This RFI is focused upon CAO requirements.  CAO coordinates and supports escorted and unescorted commercial domestic transfer and international removal operations conducted by the ICE Field Offices.  International removal mission destinations include Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, the South Pacific, and the Caribbean.  FY15 costs totaled just over $18M, which included domestic transfers as well as international removal missions.</p>
<p>Currently, to initiate the removal process via commercial air carrier, an ICE Field Office Travel Coordinator submits a mission travel request using a web-based portal provided by Omega World Travel (OWT).  This process involves manual entry of alien and officer data.  The portal e-mails the mission travel request to OWT and CAO.  CAO Enforcement and Removal Assistants (ERAs) re-key the travel request data from the e-mail into the ALIEN database.  OWT returns the final itinerary to CAO via e-mail in PDF format.  ERAs re-key itinerary info into the ALIEN database.</p>
<p><br />The current interface with Concur and OWT requires significant duplication of effort.  In order to improve the removal process as well as improve reporting and financial reconciliation capabilities, ICE desires a single integrated Travel Management Company (TMC) to handle all aspects of mission-based removal travel.  ICE plans to enable its removal systems to transmit and receive travel data directly with a TMC using the OpenTravel Alliance standard message format.  Once implemented, CAO expects to achieve these important business benefits:</p>
<p>&bull;	Remove reliance on a TMC-provided web-based portal<br />&bull;	Reduce re-keying of travel data into various internal databases<br />&bull;	Remove dependency on a general ledger financial system<br />&bull;	Streamlined ticketing<br />&bull;	Cost reimbursable billing<br />&bull;	Improved efficiency administering travel activities<br />&bull;	Cost savings, both direct travel costs and indirect human resources costs.</p>
<p>4.0	Anticipated Vendor Capabilities</p>
<p>The Government seeks industry feedback and comment on the anticipated vendor capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull;	Experience booking and ticketing domestic and complex international air travel<br />&bull;	Experience complying with Government travel regulations<br />&bull;	Experience booking and reserving hotels and other accommodations<br />&bull;	Systems that support communication via the OpenTravel Alliance standard message format<br />&bull;	Systems that can integrate the CAO Removal Guidelines travel policies and restrictions into the TMC's rules engine.  Examples of policies and restrictions include<br />o	Repatriations to Country A may not transit through Country B<br />o	Country C allows only two transits per day</p>

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.  The intent of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential qualified Small Businesses, U.S.
 Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  

This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regards to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted).  No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.
 This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8(a) Business, SBA certified HUBZone Small Business, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources with current and relevant experience, personnel, and capability to self-perform a multiple award construction contract for new construction, repair, and renovation of various heavy horizontal construction projects.

The term self-perform refers to performing relevant major trade work in-house without subcontractors.
  This does not include administrative or management functions.  Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million.  Task orders issued under the proposed multiple award contract(s) will be performed at various federal sites within the area of responsibility (AOR) of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest including, but not limited to, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that most projects will be performed in the state of California.
  The proposed contract(s) will be for one base year with 4 one-year options, resulting in the contract performance period maximum of 5 years.  The estimated total contract price for the base year and all option years combined is $200,000,000.  Task order range is estimated between $300,000 and $25,000,000.

Recent is defined as having been 100% completed within the five years prior to the Sources Sought Synopsis issuance date.  All projects shall have a minimum construction cost of $300,000.

++At least one of the relevant self-performed projects shall demonstrate experience with new construction.
++At least one of the relevant self-performed projects shall demonstrate experience with design-build.

In sections where recent experience is requested, all experience will be evaluated for market research purposes only.  Firms are advised that while experience older than five years or not yet 100% complete may demonstrate capability to perform the scope of work, it may not indicate that the firm could be competitive during a future solicitation where only the most recent five years of experience will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>Lock Excavation, Chickamauga Lock - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>W912P5-16-RFI1
<RESPDATE>012816
<CONTACT>Lether E. Robinson, Phone 6157367915, Email lether.e.robinson@usace.army.mil
<DESC>There are two Request for Information (RFI) associated with the Lock Excavation at Chickamauga Lock Project, Chattanooga, TN. First, is a general RFI to determine a competitive basis. Second, is a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) RFI to determine if use of a PLA is appropriate for this project. We request that you respond to both.
<p>The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates a requirement for a firm fixed-price construction contract to accomplish the following work* at Chickamauga Lock project:</p>
<p>Major components of the Lock Excavation contract include:</p>
<p>1. Access by water. Most work components will be on or inside the existing cofferdam located immediately downstream of the dam. The only access to provide equipment and materials to this worksite will be by water or across the channel for the lock's lower approach. A ramp dedicated to the contractor to provide land access to floating plant for this delivery is located within one eighth of a mile to the cofferdam and additional land area adjacent to the ramp will be available to the contractor.</p>
<p>2. Dewatering. The contractor will be required to install a dewatering system to dewater the cofferdam and keep it dewatered during all construction activities within the cofferdam.</p>
<p>3. Secant Pile Wall. After dewatering, a 51 foot long secant pile wall will be constructed in the cofferdam interior. The concrete secant piles will be 2 feet in diameter with the secondary piles having the addition of reinforcing steel. The piles will range in length from 22 to 44 feet and will require drilling through the limestone bedrock.</p>
<p>4. Inclined Rock Anchors. Also within the cofferdam interior, the contractor will install 44 inclined rock anchors. These are 60 to 68 strand anchors with design capacities of 1900 to 2100 kips. They range in length from 66 to 102 feet, have bond lengths of 39 to 43 feet, and are inclined 40 degrees off of horizontal.</p>
<p>5. Exploratory Drilling. Within the cofferdam, 71 exploratory drill holes will be required, up to approximately 70 feet deep.</p>
<p>6. Instrumentation. Contractor will be required to operate and maintain an existing automated and manual government furnished instrumentation system. Existing instruments include inclinometers, piezometers, alignment pins, pressure cells and survey markers.</p>
<p>7. Rock Excavation. Excavation and disposal of approximately 100,000 CY of predominantly limestone within the cofferdam. It is expected the contractor employ strict controlled blasting in the excavation of the rock in lifts ranging from 5 to 20 feet. Portions of the excavation will require approximately 5,000 CY of mechanical excavation. The maximum depth of rock excavation is approximately 32 feet. The excavation will be carried down utilizing excavation support measures such as rock bolts and shotcrete. Excavated rock will be disposed of in an upland disposal site located on Government property at Chickamauga Dam. The contractor will be required to prepare and maintain this disposal area during the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide all plant, labor and materials to construct these features.</p>

<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The work consists of the following major elements:</p>
<p>The McNary 350T bridge cranes No.1 South and No.2 North were originally constructed in 1953 by Willamette Iron and Steel Company. They each have a 350 ton capacity with a span of 78 feet. Both cranes were rehabilitated in 2005 to include replacement of the existing A3 bridge drive configuration with an A4-four corner configuration, including complete replacement of the end trucks (drive and idler truck and wheel assemblies). The current drive arrangement on each crane includes two 40 HP Magnetek Impulse G+ Series-2 VFDs and four 20 HP SEW Eurodrive MC3PEHT05-DV160L4BMGHR gear motor assemblies. One VFD drives two gear motors on the A girder and a second VFD drives the two gear motors on the B girder. The VFDs are configured in open loop vector. The open loop configuration means there is no speed or position feedback to the VFDs from the motors. Each end truck drive wheel axle is directly inserted into the hollow shaft output of the gear motor (ie. direct drive).</p>
<p>Structural Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The bottom flange of the end tie would need to be modified near the ends of the beam, to better develop the bottom flange into the girder and to close the open shape. This would mean adding horizontal plates to the bottom of the end tie and welding them to the girder. Engineer, design and perform field modifications to the operator cab and cab access as necessary for the new bridge drive equipment.</p>
<p>Mechanical Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Drive Trucks: There are four drive trucks per crane. Each will be removed for refurbishment. This will include replacement of taper tread wheels with new flat tread wheels and new idler wheels. The wheel axle assemblies will be completely replaced including new axles, wheels, keys, bearings, seals and bearing cartridge assemblies. Drive wheels will have diameters match ground to within 0.001" of each other and will be rim toughened to include tread and flange.<br />Bridge Drive Gearmotors: The motors will be replaced with encoder motors.<br />Idler Trucks: Engineer, design and install bridge drive end truck modifications to include new wheel/axle assemblies for the four corner end trucks, new motors with encoders, new lasers with mounting, laser targets, and calibration marker monuments and crane alignment targets.</p>
<p>Electrical Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The scope of work will include the removal of existing 20 hp bridge drive VFDs, bridge drive motors, and isolation transformers ; then provide and install new electrical equipment for drives, acceptance testing and commissioning, and updating as-built drawings and O&amp;M manuals. New electrical equipment will include:</p>
<p>&bull; Four (4) 20-horsepower Magnetek Impulse G+ drive VFDs, line reactors for each drive, breakers, and terminal strips all located in one new electrical panel.<br />&bull; Four (4) new 20-horsepower motors with encoders<br />&bull; Resistor bank for bridge drives<br />&bull; Cable and conduit<br />&bull; Laser anti-skewing equipment<br />&bull; PLC programming services</p>
<p>Contractor will supply and install four new Impulse G+ drives that will be mounted on a new control panel. New load reactors for VFDs will be installed in the same control panel.</p>
<p>Bridge control will use an encoder anti-skewing mode to prevent crabbing or misalignment of the crane and will also use a laser anti-skewing mode to prevent crabbing. Existing bridge motors will be replaced with new bridge motors with encoders and a laser system will be installed on the crane. A separate HMI screen will be developed for the anti-skewing system and the operator will be able to select the mode of operation via the HMI. The screen will display each laser's value in feet and the skew (the difference between the measured distance of the upstream and downstream ends of the crane) in inches. The skew value will also be displayed on the main screen of the HMI. On/Off control buttons for the bridge motors will be displayed on the same screen and will allow the operator to independently select and control each bridge motor operation. The laser anti-skewing system will measure the distance of both ends of the crane from calibrated target points on the powerhouse end walls. The laser system will have inputs to the PLC and the PLC will slow down one side of the crane to maintain alignment of the ends of the crane within one inch at all operating speeds, or the accuracy required for the lasers to acquire and maintain the targets on the powerhouse end walls. If the laser signal is suddenly lost or if the skewing is greater than four inches for two seconds, the system will transfer to the encoder mode. When in encoder anti-skewing mode - encoder feedback will be used to maintain differential between opposite bridge drives within 0.01 percent for a max error between drives resulting in not more than one-eighth (1/8) of an inch difference per twenty (20) feet of motion (bridging) measured in one direction.</p>
<p>Perform final inspections, acceptance testing and load testing of each crane. Provide as-built drawings for all modifications performed and update existing O&amp;M manuals.&nbsp;</p>

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE - This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this Sources Sought announcement. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) is soliciting information from qualified Small Business sources, the results of this announcement will be evaluated to determine if at least two VOSB sources are capable of performing the proposed work.   
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) seeks responses from Small Business Vendors that possess the capability and experience required to database support for the VA's PICIS database. The following general description outlines contractor requirements.

Background Information

In VISN 21, Acute and Critical Care data (including but not exclusive of ICU, IICU, OR, and PACU data sets) is stored in our PICIS Clinical Information System/Anesthesia Record Keeping System (CIS/ARK) database.  The CIS/ARK system itself is maintained by a combination of OEM vendor staff under a software/support maintenance contract and VISN 21 staff. PICIS/Optum is a vendor that provides the perioperative and critical care software and performs routine maintenance support for VISN 21.  A 3rd party vendor, provides analytics/reporting services for VISN 21 under a separate contract from CIS/ARK, currently provides database administration of the CIS/ARK system.

The VISN 21 facilities covered by the Picis CIS/ARK Systems are as follows:
"	San Francisco VA Medical Center, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, CA
"	VA Central California Health Care System, 2615 E. Clinton Avenue, Fresno, CA
"	VA Northern California Health Care System (including Sacramento and Martinez), 10535 Hospital Way, Sacramento, CA
"	VA Palo Alto Health Care System, 3801 Miranda Avenue, Palo Alto, CA
"	VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System, 1000 Locust Street, Reno, NV
Long-term Goals of the SOW: 

The CIS/ARK system, within VISN 21, promotes facility level care and population level surveillance and research within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The overarching goal is the ongoing quality improvement of processes, care, and outcomes (both morbidity and mortality) for the surgical and critically ill patient; and the optimization of efficiency within care sites including but not exclusive of the OR, PACU, and ICU. The utilization of standardized, objective data from the CIS/ ARK databases and electronic medical records i.e. Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record (EHR) has long been a goal of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in establishing itself as a leader in the field of perioperative and critical care.

Necessary components of this effort by the Vendor will involve:
a.	Development of customizable reports; 
b.	The development of a data mapping document(s); 
c.	Ability of the VISN to access original PICIS datasets (i.e. normalized data stores); 
d.	Work to evaluate the data quality of the original PICIS data and ensure the validity and verification of data elements.  
e.	Development of detailed training guides; 
f.	A commitment to identifying and responding to the VISN's end users' needs; and 
g.	Develop functional capabilities for the VISN to conduct research.

Scope of Work:

VISN 21 is contracting for a provider to deliver a full-featured suite of extracts, report customization, and analytics services to aid in the improvement of quality of care for surgical and critically ill patients.
The goal is to provide a tool that will ultimately use the full capacity from multiple data sources including PICIS, VistA, and other relational databases. This platform will allow multiple user groups- including clinicians and clinical and business analysts- the ability to create reports, analyze data, and facilitate ongoing quality improvement efforts addressing a) morbidity and mortality for surgical and critically ill patients; and b) the optimization of efficiency within settings including but not exclusive of the OR, PACU, and ICU. The vendor will be required to extract PICIS data from Oracle and SQL Server databases, and describe the ETL process with  data mapping documents.   The Vendor should be a VistA expert vendor (preferred) with the ability to extract VistA data and create a stable ETL process. All stages of ETL processes will be monitored, cleansed, parsed and validated for data quality.

The vendor will utilize one of the following 2 hardware options to accomplish the ETL operation and will stipulate their choice of solutions in the proposal response:
o             VA owned virtual server with SQL 2012 or
o             VA's Healthcare-Associated Infections and Influenza Surveillance System (HAIISS) Data Warehouse (HDW) data warehouse.

VA will supply IT enterprise system software, however if it requires any custom configuration outside of the gold image, then it needs to be purchased separately.

The analytic vendor must provide the services below:
a.	Development of customizable reports. This will involve initially a basic set of critical and surgical care clinical data reports that the VISN needs on a monthly basis. Based on the VISN's needs, additional reports may be needed, with data elements to be determined by the VISN. Detailed documentation on the content of sample critical clinical data (IPEC) reports are listed in Appendices 1, Section 4.0.  Briefly, the VA is mandated by national programs to measure compliance on certain data elements entered in the patient record into the electronic record (CIS/ARK Picis).  IPEC reports are one example of such requirements. The Clinical documentation at the bedside provides the data elements for these mandatory monthly reports/queries.  These reports alert the VA Facility to suboptimal compliance and corrective actions can be initiated. 
b.	The development of a data mapping document(s) that is including but not exclusive of the relationship between source and target data, primary keys, table staging, and data/value relationships.
c.	Ability of the VISN to access original PICIS datasets (i.e. normalized data stores). A mechanism will be available for the VISN CIS/ARK team to access normalized data stores of PICIS datasets for each of the facilities. The Contractor will customize a dashboard/interface that will be a Staging and Analytical platform for VISN 21 analytics.
d.	Work to evaluate the data quality of the original PICIS data and ensure the validity and verification of data elements.  Ongoing efforts will be undertaken to evaluate data quality rules to include but not exclusive of attribute domain, relational integrity, historical validity, and state-dependency. This will be a combined effort with the VISN CIS/ARK team. Sample reports are further detailed in Appendix, Section 3.0.
e.	Development of detailed training guides. This section addresses additional training of VISN 21 personnel in the use of the analytic environment to create and maintain quality improvement/resource utilization reports, as well as the creation of custom provider reports, and provide clinical / technical support for database report creation and analysis and custom enhancements to the user interface. The Contractor shall provide training as necessary to VA so that our VISN can maximize the benefits of the system. Training shall be provided in various forms of media, including but not limited to online tutorials, manuals and on-site training.

<CONTACT>Brandon S. Hill, Contract/Grant Officer, Phone 9195415532, Email Brandon.s.hill24.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is soliciting proposals for the Advanced Packaging of Power Semiconductor (APPS) program under Topic 1.4.3, "Wide Band-Gap Power Devices," of the ARL Core Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research, W911NF-12-R-0011.  ARL is soliciting proposals under this Special Notice of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the performance of applied research focused on extending the state-of-the-art in multi-die packaging of semiconductor devices for high-power applications.  The aim of this Special Notice under the BAA is to address the current limitations of conventional packaging and support the recent advancements in silicon carbide (SiC) power device technology for military and commercial applications.
<p>SiC has emerged as a power semiconductor material with electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that allow it to far surpass the performance of conventional silicon (Si) power technology and make it the prime candidate for next-generation high-power switching devices for military, as well as commercial, applications.  SiC power devices have been demonstrated to provide greater than twice the power density of Si power devices and at greater efficiency.  Traditional packaging approaches are now the limiting factor in fully realizing the performance benefits offered by SiC power device technology.</p>
<p>Solutions are sought for the development of holistic, multiphysics approaches to power module development that address electrical, thermal and thermomechanical issues in a coupled manner to realize the full performance of SiC semiconductor devices.  SiC is being explored and/or implemented for low voltage (600 V to 1200 V), medium voltage (3.3 kV - 6.5 kV), and high voltage (10 kV - 24 kV) military and/or commercial applications.  Depending on the voltage class and current levels involved, electrical considerations may include high dv/dt capability, partial discharge, electromagnetic interference (EMI), common mode current from parasitic capacitance, inductance, miller capacitance, and external electrical connections.  Thermal considerations may include heat dissipation capability, package thermal resistance, and external thermal interfacing.  The thermomechanical aspects may include compliant interface materials, coefficient of thermal expansion matching and thermal/power cycling capability.  The above enumeration of considerations is not all-inclusive nor exhaustive.  A successful proposal will provide an innovative packaging solution which integrates novel configurations, advanced manufacturing technologies, numerical analyses, novel materials, and/or innovative design processes.</p>
<p>The Army is considering several application examples wherein high temperature power modules are utilized.  It is anticipated that, over the period of performance, an applicant will be able to demonstrate an advanced module design that provides dramatic improvements over current state-of-the-art commercial packaging.  Since the APPS program goals align well with future high-power commercial applications, it is also expected that an applicant will include matching funds of no less than 25% of their total proposed program costs. This cost sharing should be clearly reflected in an applicant's proposed budget.  There will be no equipment purchases using federal funds associated with awards made as a result of this Special Notice.</p>
<p>Funding is currently available for up to three cooperative agreements related to the SiC APPS program for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 funds. However, the Government reserves the right to award as many, as few, or no awards based on the proposals received from this Special Notice. While the BAA and Topic remain open for proposal submission until 31 March 2017, in order to be eligible for award under this Special Notice with the funding available for FY 2016, proposals must be received in accordance with the due dates and instructions provided in this announcement. It is anticipated that up to three "cooperative agreements" (31 USC 6305) will be awarded, pursuant to 10 USC 2358 Research Projects, each with a period of performance between twelve and eighteen months.  The total amount available for all awards is anticipated to be approximately $2,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The principal purpose of a cooperative agreement is for the public purpose of support and stimulation of fundamental research and not the acquisition of property or provision of services for the direct benefit or use of the Government.  A Recipient of a cooperative agreement will work collaboratively with scientists from ARL to further the SiC APPS program.  ARL will participate in the research and use its strong in-house technical expertise to jointly plan and execute the research program with a Recipient. ARL will assess the multi-chip module designs for applicability to Army-specific stresses.  ARL will also analyze provided modules' electrical and physical response.  These analyses and supporting data will be shared with a Recipient and ways to augment the package design, materials and/or process to improve performance will be jointly determined.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for a cooperative agreement to be awarded with the FY2016 funding for this program, applicants are to submit proposals in accordance with the submission instructions under BAA W911NF-12-R-0011-03 no later than 07 February 2016.  Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria listed in the BAA. Once an applicant submits a complete proposal, the applicant shall notify the point of contact listed via email and provide their Grants.gov submission tracking number. Under this Special Notice, no formal Q&amp;A will take place. If an applicant has a general and/or clarification technical question related to this Special Notice, contact Mr. Dimeji Ibitayo at oladimeji.o.ibitayo.civ@mail.mil. For general contractual/assistance related questions, contact Mr. Brandon Hill at Brandon.s.hill24.civ@mail.mil. This special notice expires 07 February 2016 at 11:59 PM (EST).</p>

<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based upon the responses received.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent- Teledyne RISI, Inc.
<SOLNBR>RFQ-0003177
<RESPDATE>012116
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email kemper.wood@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole-source, fixed price contract with Teledyne RISI, Inc., 32727 W Corral Hollow Rd., Tracy, CA, 95376-0000 for the purpose of procuring the FS-43 Firing System.
<p><br />The FBI TIEDS Center is executing an improvised explosives research effort.&nbsp; The TIEDS Centers overall goal of the research is to thoroughly characterize synthesized improvised explosive materials. The TIEDS Center is often faced with questions from the law enforcement and intelligence communities regarding the effects of improvised explosives. In order to test devices and charges on the range it is necessary to have firing units which are capable of safely and reliably initiating exploding bridge wire (EBW) detonators. Without firing units, it is not possible to initiate the devices in a safe and reliable manner in order to obtain the characterization data required by the TIEDS facility. This requirement is essential because, currently, the TIEDS center has no ability to safely and reliably initiate EBW devices on its testing ranges. The system outline below would provide TIEDS a means to initiate charges over a large distance using low voltage firing lines which are inherently safer than their high voltage counterparts. The requirements for this capability are listed below.</p>
<p>1. The system must be capable of initiating EBW detonators at up to 1,000 feet away reliably.<br />2. The system must use a low voltage firing line (&lt;200 V) to charge a remote high voltage firing module.<br />3. The system must be equipped with a safety interlock connector on both the control unit and the remote firing unit to prevent accidental firing.<br />4. The system must be capable of firing a charge with less than 10 microsecond delay.<br />5. The system must have a meter to monitor the voltage of the firing system.<br />6. The system must be capable of utilizing either a manual or external trigger.<br />7. The system must be capable of remotely arming.<br />8. The system must have a sealed arming switch with an indicator light.<br />9. The system must run off of standard 110V wall power.<br />10. The trigger in and out connection must be of standard BNC type.<br />11. The system must be internally protected against electrical shorts.<br />12. The system must have external dimensions such that it can be mounted in standard 19 inch equipment rack.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that only the FS-43 Firing System meets all the FBI's requirements stated above and Teledyne RISI, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributer of this product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 325920, Explosives Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. <br />Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: <strong>Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Thursday, January 21, 2016, 2016 (3:00 pm Eastern).</strong> Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, limited source, fixed price contract with WaferGen, Inc., 7400 Paseo Padre Parkway, Fremont, CA, 94538-6409, for the purpose of procuring a maintenance agreement for its existing Apollo 324 instrument and a copy of the Apollo P Suite development software.
<p>In order to support the FBI Laboratory's DNA program activities by advancing the technologies applied to DNA casework and expand the range of specimens from which probative data can be recovered, the DNA Support Unit (DSU) is in the process of evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) instruments and technologies. As part of these efforts, DSU is developing workflows that incorporate automation. Automated workflows further streamline labor-intensive processes, improve precision and reproducibility, and reduce the hands-on time required for DNA casework. The Apollo 324 system is an automated liquid handling workstation that prepares DNA for downstream DNA sequencing via NGS instruments. In order for the DSU to continue its workflow development, a maintenance contract for DSU's existing Apollo 324 system is required. The maintenance will ensure that future software updates, preventive maintenance needs, instrument failures, instrument upgrades and other items are addressed in a timely and cost effective manner. This will in turn ensure that workflow development can progress unhindered.</p>
<p>The Apollo 324 instrument is pre-loaded with standard sample preparation methods; however, these methods are not optimized to the FBI Laboratory's needs. In order for the DSU to develop NGS sample preparation protocols customized to the FBI Laboratory's DNA sequencing needs, the P-Suite software for the Apollo 324 is required. The P-suite software will allow the DSU to develop sample preparation methods appropriate for FBI Laboratory applications, create custom protocols for the Apollo 324, and allow for the use of a wider variety of NGS library preparations already on the instrument. This will enable DSU to perform more thorough optimizations, evaluations, and validations of the wide variety of NGS methodologies.</p>

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity for Evaluating the Production and Efficacy of a Broadly Protective Universal Influenza Viral-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine in an Influenza A Virus Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model
<SOLNBR>NIAID-TTIPO-2014-016
<RESPDATE>051416
<CONTACT>Jenish R. Patel, Ph.D., Technology Development Specialist, Phone 2406692894, Email jenish.patel@nih.gov - Maryann T. Puglielli, Ph.D., J.D., Technology Development Specialist, Phone 2406273723, Email maryann.puglielli@nih.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is announcing an opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for evaluating a broadly protective influenza VLP-based &lsquo;universal' vaccine in Phase I safety trials and subsequently in Phase II efficacy trials using an Influenza A Virus Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model developed at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). NIAID seeks to enter into a CRADA to produce a GMP-manufactured influenza VLP &lsquo;universal' vaccine. Clinical Phase I safety trial and subsequently Phase II efficacy trials may be conducted with a single CRADA partner or may be accomplished with a different CRADA partner for each phase, utilizing the Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model developed by NIAID.
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The high seasonal morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza, the continued threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza infections, the development and global spread of antiviral resistance, and the need to plan for future influenza pandemics makes influenza a high priority in infectious disease research. Indeed, up to 49,000 people die annually from complications due to seasonal influenza infection in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>Existing inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines generally only offer protection against antigenically well-matched strains. Because of the rapid and unpredictable evolution of influenza viruses, vaccines providing broad protection against antigenically variant strains of influenza would be useful both as pre-pandemic vaccines and as seasonal vaccines. NIAID has developed an influenza VLP-based vaccine that offered very broad protection against a variety of influenza A viruses, including viruses expressing hemagglutinin subtypes not contained in the vaccine. Initial experimental evaluations in mice have been published [Schwartzman, et al. mBio 2015;6(4):e01044], and experiments evaluating this vaccine approach in ferrets are underway. Because animal models of influenza are limited in their ability to replicate human disease, development and evaluation of better vaccines and vaccine strategies will require significant clinical development. Moreover, many important questions about influenza infection and immune response can only be approached through human studies of influenza.</p>
<p>Experimental animal studies in mice and ferrets with the &lsquo;universal' influenza vaccine candidate have utilized VLPs produced either with an insect cell/baculovirus expression system or produced by transient transfection of mammalian cells. For clinical evaluation of the VLP vaccine candidate, an initial step would be to evaluate methods for optimizing VLP production and GMP manufacture. Once pilot lot GMP-manufactured vaccine is produced, it could next be evaluated in Phase I safety trials. Subsequent Phase II efficacy trials can be performed using a human influenza challenge model in the clinic.</p>
<p>In an effort to facilitate these clinical studies, NIAID has already developed a clinical influenza challenge model, the Influenza A Virus Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model, using challenge viruses which are reverse genetics produced and cell cultured wild-type influenza A viruses for use in healthy volunteers under Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently NIAID has an A(H1N1)pdm09 Influenza virus available under an IND and will soon begin validating a contemporary A/H3N2 influenza virus for use in human studies.</p>
<p>The Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model stands to streamline and reduce the cost of evaluating candidate vaccines. Specifically, Phase II clinical studies of influenza are expensive and inefficient due to the large numbers of subjects needed to determine the efficacy of a new vaccine, and they are limited in their ability to provide standardized data due to an inability (1) to identify the timing of viral exposure and development of disease and (2) to assess pre-exposure immunity. These factors limit the success of such studies and an investigator's ability to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine. In a well-characterized challenge model such as this, the number of volunteers needed for subsequent efficacy studies will be smaller and the resulting data more informative.</p>
<p>A CRADA is the anticipated collaborative agreement to be entered into with NIAID pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified as 15 U.S.C. 3710a, and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities. A CRADA is not a grant, and it is not a contract for the procurement of goods and services. NIAID is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIAID can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise. The CRADA collaborator can contribute facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funds. The CRADA collaborator will also have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. The goals of the CRADA include the rapid publication of research results and timely commercialization of products, diagnostics, and treatments that result from the research.</p>
<p>CRADA partners are currently being sought to further develop and evaluate a novel broadly protective influenza VLP-based vaccine, including VLP vaccine production methods and GMP manufacture, evaluation in Phase I safety trials, and evaluation of the vaccine in Phase II efficacy trials utilizing NIAID's Influenza A Virus Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>Studies will be designed (1) to evaluate production and GMP manufacture of the influenza VLP vaccine candidate, and (2) to further the clinical evaluation of the vaccine candidate in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. NIAID's principal investigator has extensive experience with running clinical studies of human influenza, working with animal models of influenza pathogenesis and host adaptation, experimental vaccine development, and both classic and molecular virology studies.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: CRADA partners will be expected to have the capacity to produce and GMP manufacture influenza VLPs for use in clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Prospective CRADA partners should have the expertise and resources to collaborate with NIAID to evaluate the GMP produced vaccine in a clinical setting. In addition, it will be expected that the prospective CRADA partner will provide funding to supplement the NIAID principal investigator's budget to support this project.</p>
<p>Prospective CRADA partners are expected to provide a written Capability Statement to the contact person indicated in this announcement prior to consideration by NIAID. The Capability Statement must address, with specificity, each of the following selection criteria: (1) a description of the partner's ability, experience, expertise, and facilities to manufacture influenza viral like particles and for conducting clinical trials; (2) a description of the partner's ability to perform supporting tests (i.e., biochemical, toxicological and immunological testing) relevant to the study; (3) the technical expertise of the partner's principal investigator and laboratory group; (4) the availability and location of the facilities to carry out the study, and (5) the ability to provide adequate funding to support performance of the research plan throughout the life of the CRADA. NIAID will consider executing a Confidentiality Agreement with a prospective CRADA partner to facilitate receipt of the Capability Statement if requested by a prospective CRADA partner.</p>

<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Biowaves Inc. to set up the NWFSC's two towed acoustic array systems array systems on the R/V Bell M. Shimada, and provide staff trained to use these arrays to acoustically as well as visually detect marine animals during a 21 day vessel survey off the Oregon, Washington, and California that begins 20 February 2016.
<p><br />The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources. The NWFSC provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. Limited information is available on the winter distribution of endangered southern resident killer whales.  A small amount of observational data suggests that the whales use the coastal waters of Washington, Oregon, California, and British Columbia during the winter months. Additional location data are needed to inform Recovery Plan data gaps and risk factors as well as inform Critical Habitat designation.</p>
<p>The NWFSC has a critical need for ongoing continuity in the collection of this type of acoustic&nbsp;data.  These data will be key to meeting mission critical requirements and mandates in the Southern Resident Killer Whale Recovery Plan under the ESA, and particular to meet our imminent Critical Habitat Designation revision deadline in 2016.  Bio-Waves designed and custom-built the twin towed hydrophone arrays that the NWFSC has used on all its cetacean surveys since 2004. In 2012, a new array was designed and built with Bio-Waves staff involvement and this array was used on the 2013 survey cruise by Bio-Waves staff. In addition, the cetacean acoustical tracking system associated with these arrays requires a very high degree of skill to operate.  Only the Bio-Wave's staff has the skills to effectively operate this system to track whales, particularly killer whales.  Bio-Waves has trained their staff to specifically know how to use this acoustic tracking system and they have done so for all seven of our previous cruises from 2004-2015. It is critical that this system is fully operational from the time the survey effort begins, i.e., as soon as the ship leaves the harbor and that data are collected in a manner consistent with prior year data sets as well as NMFS standards for this type of data.  Consequently, a highly skilled staff  knowledgeable in the operation of the system is required.  Similarly, a significant level of technical expertise is required to operate the array and monitor the tracking system in order to successfully "locate" the killer whales to collect the data required. In addition, very specialized skills are required to be to use the array to acoustically track whales without inadvertently losing them. The ability to be fully operational on all these aspects from day one is extremely critical given the limited number of sea days we have. Finally, in the event that the there is some type of system failure the Bio-Waves team has the expertise to repair the system.</p>
<p>This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  It is the Government's belief that only Biowaves  Inc. can seamlessly continue the work under this contract.  However, firms that believe they can provide the services required in this project that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days of publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions concerning this announcement  must be emailed to Maria Mendoza at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov or faxed at (206)527-7513. This is a simplified acquisition.</p>

The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334513, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees for an upcoming requirement for the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO 80225 to provide PALL WATER FILTERS; Brand Name or Equal to Brand Name Salient Characteristics. 


Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR). The NMR allows a small business to offer a product that it did not manufacturer under a small business set-aside if Small Business Administration (SBA) has offered a waiver. SBA does not offer a waiver for these supplies. On a supply contract, a firm must perform at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials). The NMR is an exception to the performance requirements, and provides that a firm that is not a manufacturer may qualify as a small business on a supply contract set aside for small business if, among other things, it supplies the product of a small business made in the United States. The Brand Name supplies are not made by a small business in the United States.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.

This requirement is for water filters which are equal to the attached Brand Name Salient Characteristics.

The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.) This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 334513 if their AVERAGE annual number of employees for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to 500 employees. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from small business firms, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms who feel that they can provide the filters that meet or exceed the attached Brand Name Salient Characteristics (based upon the criteria specified), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response must include references with contact names, email addresses, and phone numbers. These references are to be for contracts similar in scope as the contract under consideration. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

<CONTACT>Edgar, Becky
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) is seeking the procurement of the operation of a NADP/NTN wet atmospheric monitoring station near Greenwood, Texas. Operation requires weekly site visits to the site to collect, process, and ship the precipitation sample, collect, process and transmit associated data with the site including the precipitation gage record and perform routine instrument checks, maintenance and repairs as needed. NADP site operations is described in detail in the document National Trends Network Site Operations Manual at http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/lib/manuals/opman.pdf

Period of Performance will be 2/1/2016 through 1/31/2017.

The USGS Office of Water Quality requires a provider of atmospheric deposition station operation services for a cooperatively supported station between the USGS and the site owner and operator in support of the interagency National Atmospheric Deposition Program, National Trends Network (NADP-NTN) 

The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award to Dale Burks, unless it is contacted by any who believes they have obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service. Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Becky Edgar via email at bedgar@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST, Monday, January 25, 2016 with an affirmative answer. 


SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:

The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractors unique qualifications:

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Mission Area, Office of Water Quality requests a sole source acquisition with the following provider of atmospheric deposition station operation services for a cooperatively supported station between the USGS and the site owner and operator in support of the interagency National Atmospheric Deposition Program, National Trends Network (NADP-NTN):
Mr. Burks is a retired professor who is qualified based on his education and technical scientific experience. Faculty members have the experience, knowledge, and expertise complete the requirements without training or time spent in learning how to operate the equipment. It is essential that this requirement be continued without loss of data due to the continuous record requirement for site operation. If a site is shut down temporarily, the value of the entire multi-decade data record from the site becomes impaired and loses value for statistical trend analysis.    The monitoring site and analytical laboratory are located on U.S. Forest Service property; LBJ Grasslands.  USGS is responsible for the operation of nine atmospheric deposition sites where the land and the site is owned by another organization, agency or individual and are in restricted scientific research areas, TX56 is one of these nine sites. It is a mutually beneficial scientific and technical partnership between this organization that has purview over the site location and desire the information collected from this site. USGS needs information gathered from this site as part of a national network for national-scale measurement of the status and trends in wet deposition. Moving the site would result in a break of the long-term environment monitoring record, i.e. a new site location data would not be comparable to the previous site, which typically has continuous monitoring data back to the early 1980s.
Mr. Burks is the only known and available source qualified to collect this information on atmospheric deposition in this remote area.


The NADP is a public, nonprofit, unincorporated, interstate association of parties interested in atmospheric deposition and its effects. It is structured as a cooperative program that represents coordinated efforts of many federal, state, academic, and private organizations and individuals to operate monitoring sites, report data, and oversee research activities related to atmospheric deposition. Membership in NADP is open to individuals and institutions interested in participating in any aspect of atmospheric deposition monitoring and/or research stemming from NADP data. This organizational structure is consistent with State Agricultural Experiment Station (SAES) Guidelines for Multi-state Research Activities. The contracts the USGS seeks to award represent partnerships to support sites in the most efficient manner with organizations and individuals that own and control the local site locations. Under the interagency National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program established in 1981, the USGS is the designated lead agency for the monitoring of atmospheric deposition and NADP is the operational organization through which the USGS and other participating organizations accomplish this national-scale monitoring in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

Where a USGS-supported site can be potentially operated by any number of interested individuals or organizations, we offer those site duties via a competitive process. This document describes the situation where we have sites that cannot be competed due to the cooperative partnership aspect of these sites location and ownership. No other source is known in the Greenwood, Texas, area that is qualified to complete the requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District (SAM) intends to award a modification extending option year four period of performance for a period not-to-exceed six (6) months pursuant to FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The Government contemplates extending the services on a month-to-month basis, but no more than the six (6) month limitation provided by the clause. Contract W91278-11-C-0008 was awarded as a cost plus award fee contract with a base year and four one (1) year options. The contractor is Anderson Construction Company of Fort Gaines, Fort Gaines, Georgia. The contract was awarded as 100% set-aside for small business. The current period performance covering Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, West Point Lake Georgia ends April 27, 2016. This extension will allow the Government to extend the current period of performance not-to-exceed six (6) months to allow for the receipt of proposals, source selection review, discussions, and any potential protest that might be associated with the replacement contract solicited under W91278-16-R-0012. The revised period of performance may be extended through October 2016. The program requirements are currently executed by technical provisions which provide certain planning, supervision, labor, subcontract, equipment, materials and supplies to efficiently maintain Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment at West Point Lake, Georgia.

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />&bull; Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States. <br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (OCT 2015)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.222-22 PREVIOUS CONTRACTS AND COMPLIANCE REPORTS (FEB 1999)</p>
<p>The offeror represents that --</p>
<p>(a) ( ) It has, ( ) has not participated in a previous contract or subcontract subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this solicitation;</p>
<p>(b) ( ) It has, ( ) has not, filed all required compliance reports; and</p>
<p>(c) Representations indicating submission of required compliance reports, signed by proposed subcontractors, will be obtained before subcontract awards.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.222-25 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMPLIANCE (APR 1984)</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:<br />The <strong>Monongahela National Forest</strong> (managed by the USDA Forest Service) in West Virginia is seeking to form Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to accomplish <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forest-wide range fencing and vegetation clearing work</strong></span>. Interested Vendors should submit prices for the work they are interested in performing and for the areas in which they are interested in performing as described in this announcement.
<p><br />The Contractor will be required to provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, transportation, supplies (unless otherwise designated), permits, licenses and incidentals as required in the Schedule of Items and Specifications of this announcement necessary to perform range fencing and vegetation clearing work.

<p><br />This position is located on-site in Washington DC at the Department of Compact Operations (DCO). DCO divides the management of the MCC compact portfolio into three regional divisions (Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Latin America; East &amp; Southern Africa; and West Africa) and one technical services division.

<p>The Department of Compact Operations (DCO) of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is seeking a full-time Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to serve as a Special Assistant to the Principal Deputy Vice President of the department of compact operations.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502).  By law and by the contract's terms, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure.  However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

<DESC>NOTICE TO BE INSERTED IN LOCAL SOURCE REQUIREMENTS <br />REQUIREMENTS BEING SOLICITED FROM LOCAL SOURCES:<br />All sources may submit a proposal or quote as applicable. However, the Republic of Korea (ROK)-United States (U.S.) Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), precludes the U.S. Government from granting Invited Contractor or Technical Representative status to any offeror, for this requirement. All sources submitting a proposal or quote, as applicable, including U.S. sources, must already have, or obtain the requisite business licenses directly from the ROK Government, and conduct business in accordance with all applicable ROK laws, including but not limited to, rules and policies regarding labor, taxation, and immigration. Any contractor not already doing business in Korea as a local source, must submit adequate verification in its initial proposal or quote, that it has the requisite authorization and capacity to compete for the requirement as a local source, and to perform the contract as a local source. If an initial proposal does not fully demonstrate this authorization and capacity, it will not be further considered for award. Whether an offeror qualifies as a local source shall be determined by the Contracting Officer. <br />

<DESC>The objectives of this project are to address key research needs by establishing performance benchmarks for SSA and NTA methods.  To date, there are few, if any, analysis and reporting standards for studies utilizing SSA and NTA methods/  As such, method performance characteristics (e.g. percentages of false negatives and positives) are difficult to discern, and the true potential of these methods remains unknown (and unrealized).  Our main interests are therefore identifying and communicating the state-of-the-science for SSA and NTA methods via systematic execution of carefully designed and controlled experiments.

<CONTACT>Edgar, Becky
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) is seeking the procurement of the operation of a NADP/NTN wet atmospheric monitoring station near Greenwood, Texas. Operation requires weekly site visits to the site to collect, process, and ship the precipitation sample, collect, process and transmit associated data with the site including the precipitation gage record and perform routine instrument checks, maintenance and repairs as needed. NADP site operations is described in detail in the document National Trends Network Site Operations Manual at http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/lib/manuals/opman.pdf

Period of Performance will be 2/1/2016 through 1/31/2017.

The USGS Office of Water Quality requires a provider of atmospheric deposition station operation services for a cooperatively supported station between the USGS and the site owner and operator in support of the interagency National Atmospheric Deposition Program, National Trends Network (NADP-NTN) 

The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award to Dale Burks, unless it is contacted by any who believes they have obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service. Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Becky Edgar via email at bedgar@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST, Monday, January 25, 2016 with an affirmative answer. 


SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:

The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractors unique qualifications:

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Mission Area, Office of Water Quality requests a sole source acquisition with the following provider of atmospheric deposition station operation services for a cooperatively supported station between the USGS and the site owner and operator in support of the interagency National Atmospheric Deposition Program, National Trends Network (NADP-NTN):
Mr. Burks is a retired professor who is qualified based on his education and technical scientific experience. Faculty members have the experience, knowledge, and expertise complete the requirements without training or time spent in learning how to operate the equipment. It is essential that this requirement be continued without loss of data due to the continuous record requirement for site operation. If a site is shut down temporarily, the value of the entire multi-decade data record from the site becomes impaired and loses value for statistical trend analysis.    The monitoring site and analytical laboratory are located on U.S. Forest Service property; LBJ Grasslands.  USGS is responsible for the operation of nine atmospheric deposition sites where the land and the site is owned by another organization, agency or individual and are in restricted scientific research areas, TX56 is one of these nine sites. It is a mutually beneficial scientific and technical partnership between this organization that has purview over the site location and desire the information collected from this site. USGS needs information gathered from this site as part of a national network for national-scale measurement of the status and trends in wet deposition. Moving the site would result in a break of the long-term environment monitoring record, i.e. a new site location data would not be comparable to the previous site, which typically has continuous monitoring data back to the early 1980s.
Mr. Burks is the only known and available source qualified to collect this information on atmospheric deposition in this remote area.


The NADP is a public, nonprofit, unincorporated, interstate association of parties interested in atmospheric deposition and its effects. It is structured as a cooperative program that represents coordinated efforts of many federal, state, academic, and private organizations and individuals to operate monitoring sites, report data, and oversee research activities related to atmospheric deposition. Membership in NADP is open to individuals and institutions interested in participating in any aspect of atmospheric deposition monitoring and/or research stemming from NADP data. This organizational structure is consistent with State Agricultural Experiment Station (SAES) Guidelines for Multi-state Research Activities. The contracts the USGS seeks to award represent partnerships to support sites in the most efficient manner with organizations and individuals that own and control the local site locations. Under the interagency National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program established in 1981, the USGS is the designated lead agency for the monitoring of atmospheric deposition and NADP is the operational organization through which the USGS and other participating organizations accomplish this national-scale monitoring in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

Where a USGS-supported site can be potentially operated by any number of interested individuals or organizations, we offer those site duties via a competitive process. This document describes the situation where we have sites that cannot be competed due to the cooperative partnership aspect of these sites location and ownership. No other source is known in the Greenwood, Texas, area that is qualified to complete the requirement.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p class="MsoNormal">Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>

It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<p>The intent of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to secure a contractor that will provide administrative services for the NIH Child Care Subsidy Program.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations to administer Agency's child care tuition assistance program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 12, 2001, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 2590 into Public Law 107-67 which includes permanent legislation authorizing the use of appropriated funds by executive agencies to provide child care services for Federal civilian employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This legislation permits Federal agencies to administer a program to assist their lower income Federal employees with the costs of child care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will administer the program on behalf of the agency for the period of April 1, 2016 through December 31, 2021, with four (one year) extensions.</p>
<p>In FY2014, 142 NIH Federal Employees were served with 180 children to receive the tuition assistance from the NIH Child Care Subsidy program.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to assist lower income Federal employees with the cost of licensed child care services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tuition assistance can reduce the amount of tuition parents pay for child care by providing subsidies, directly to the licensed child care provider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By providing assistance with child care cost, the employee can obtain quality dependable child care.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires a contractor to demonstrate it has the ability to effectively manage the NIH Child Care Subsidy program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In responding to this request, a contractor must demonstrate its ability to perform the following services:</p>

<DESC>** Please see below vendor questions and technical representatives answers. Also bid will be extended until 1/19/2016, All&nbsp;quotes must be received by&nbsp; 1/19/2016 3:00pm EST.<br />&nbsp;
<p>1) #11 on section "Building 2112), it says"Remove and hall away all unused legacy cabling that is no longer in use throughout the entire building."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According the site visit only cables being removed are from within the area of Rooms 1, 5, 5a, 13 and to SIPR cabinet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are no asbuilts or any other information on other existing cabling throughout building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please advise</p>
<p><strong>A: Pretty straight forward, we are asking that you remove all cable not in use. The purpose of the walkthrough was so that the vendors would understand the scope of what they have to remove. We do not have any quantifiable information to provide such as length of the existing fiber, quantity, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are legacy cables that have existed before TSD was a tenant.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;2) On #2-Cabling it says "At the SIPR cabinet, the cables will be dressed into a new 2U fiber enclosure and connected to new 6-ST coupler panels", however because they are ST connectors a 2U rack will only hold 6 (6-ST panels) so that means only 36 ST terminations can be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However if seems you have a total of 90 connections to do at SIPR cabinet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My recommendation is to do either a 3U(which holds up to 72 connections) and 2U. Please advise</p>
<p><strong>A: We have sufficient free space in the cabinet to support a 3U+2U configuration.</strong></p>
<p><br />4) On building 2112 section it says there are a total of 11 FTTD to accomodate workstations, however the above in Statement of work it says there are a total of 15 drops?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can you advise which is the correct number of drops?</p>
<p><strong>A: 15 is a typo. 11 is stated at item number 2 (under 'Building 2112') and the total of the drops provided by item number 4 (in the same section) backs up the total of 11.</strong></p>
<p>1) It was mentioned at meeting that the number of strands on fiber cable would change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it still OM-1 (6 strand) Plenum?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>A: Yes we are still asking for OM-1 (6 strand) plenum rated cable in EMT conduit.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;2) It is our understanding based on scope that we are to install/terminate the fiber adapters and wallplates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Patch cords, computer equipment or transceivers or anything above that is not in our scope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just wanted to confirm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>A: The vendor is responsible for installing and terminating each fiber strand at each end (the wall plates in the offices and the patch panel inside the safe, room 13). No patch cords, equipment or transceivers, is required by the vendor. Just the cabling runs.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Is there an approximate number of non-operating/new junction boxes that will be required?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A: we will require 6 new junction boxes within room 5, 1 new junction box in room 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<p><strong>Q3: </strong> The [Definitional Mission report] suggested eight months to prepare the document. The Grant Agreement states: Both parties agree the study will completed on March 31st, 2016. Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>A3: </strong> The Study completion date in the Grant Agreement is an estimated date and can be updated once the Contractor is selected.</p>
<p><strong>Q4:</strong> We are wondering if the "key personnel" is the "Personnel Requirements" described on page 80 of the Definitional Mission report. In previous USTDA RFP's the list [of?] key personnel for which we have to submit the CV's was always in the main body of the USTDA RFP itself. Should we assume that the "key personnel" is consistent with the "Personnel Requirements" described on page 80 of the Definitional Mission report?</p>
<p><strong>A4:</strong> Please refer to Section 3 of the RFP for information and guidance on proposal formal and content, including "key personnel." Per Section 2.3 of the RFP, portions of the Definitional Mission report are provided in Annex 2 of the RFP for background information only.</p>

(iii) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66, April, 2013.

The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations supplement (VAAR) can be accessed on the Internet at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/ (FAR) and http://vaww.appc1.va.gov/oamm/vaar (VAAR) 

(iv) This solicitation is issued as unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423450, and the size standard is 500. The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

This announcement will close at 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 18 January 2016. Quotes should be sent to Kelly L. Byers via email at kelly.byers@va.gov. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

(vi)  The following PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT is a detailed description of the requirements for this solicitation:
REQUESTING SERVICE:  	Clinical Engineering

INTRODUCTION:	

The purpose of this service contract is to ensure that medical equipment booms throughout VA Boston are receiving preventative maintenance in a timely and effective manner per the manufacturer's recommendations. Medical equipment booms are highly specialized pieces of equipment which require specific training and equipment to service, which clinical engineering currently does not have. Since the equipment has a high complexity but low frequency for service, this skillset is hard to maintain in-house.  This scope of work will outline the requirements and expectations for potential vendors that can provide the aforementioned preventative maintenance services.


BACKGROUND:	

The VA Boston Healthcare system currently has medical equipment booms in the OR and endoscopy procedure rooms at both the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain medical centers.  Medical equipment booms are ceiling mounting structures which hold medical equipment in a consolidated carrier and also clinicians to position the equipment around the operating suite in a more efficient manner. Equipment booms also have medical gas lines and power outlets built in so that the clinician has everything they need to provide patient care anywhere in the room. Although these booms are extremely helpful and provide procedure room organization, they are highly specialized pieces of equipment which require specific training and equipment to service, which clinical engineering currently does not have. Since the equipment has a high complexity but low frequency for service, this skillset is hard to maintain in-house.

SCOPE OF WORK & REQUIREMENTS:
	
The service contract to help maintain these booms should contain the following components at a minimum:

a.)	The contractor must have service personnel with experience and expertise on the boom make/models identified below.

b.)	The contractor must perform preventative maintenance (PM) on the booms annually to meet the manufacturer's recommended service frequency.


c.)	The preventative maintenance should cover the following areas per the manufacturer's recommendations:
"	Tightening of all fasteners/hardware
"	Checking mounting structure above the ceiling, and adjusting as necessary to ensure proper function
"	Clean entire boom system
"	Check for medical gas leaks
"	Check all friction adjustments & adjust as necessary
"	Level all shelves
"	Check articulation stops
"	Clean old grease and bioburden within joints
"	Grease friction points as necessary
"	Check-up limit stops on all hydraulic (EL) arms
"	Check down limit stops on dock it systems
"	Check cables and hoses for wear and for proper articulation
"	Check pump oil level on hydraulic (EL) arms
"	Check and adjust upper and lower hydraulic arm limit switches
"	Check incoming voltage to pump
"	Check outlet electrical connections
"	Check communication cable connections
"	Check function of gas outlet latch valves
"	Check for proper fuses in pump assembly
"	Test circuit breaker function in pump assembly
"	Check plumb adjustment of flat screen arm if applicable
"	Level of monitors
"	Check all warning labels and decals
"	Check all wiring to ensure proper connections are made at the point of termination

d.)	Emergency repairs, including labor and travel rates will be inclusive of the preventive maintenance quote request. 
  
e.)	Any issues found related to electrical, medical gases, vacuum, or other utilities need to be reported to clinical engineering. These items must be addressed internally through the VA engineering/facilities department.

f.)	The contractor must provide a report of service summary for any work performed to the clinical engineering point of contact.

g.)	Clinical engineering requires a maximum 4 hour call back response time for any non-PM service related issues that are communicated to the contractor. Likewise clinical engineer requires a maximum 24 hour timeframe in which the contractor must be on-site to address any service calls.

h.)	If a boom is removed from service, the VA should be refunded credit valued based on the amount of time left that was previously paid for that contract year.

i.)	One session of first responder training for booms at both the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain VA Medical Centers.

j.)	No parts should be ordered without prior confirmation from the clinical engineering service.

k.)	Clinical engineering will require at least an annual meeting to review contract performance, equipment changes, and provide support feedback.

SUMMARY OF DELIVERABLES:

The following list itemizes the expected deliverables from the contractor:
a.)	One annual PM per equipment boom listed in the attached equipment inventory
b.)	Emergency repair services at a defined labor and travel rate
c.)	Service reports on all PM and emergency repair calls
d.)	Maximum 4 hr initial response call via phone, and maximum 24 hrs timeframe for on-site service
e.)	One first responder training for both West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain VA Medical Centers

<DESC>***IMPORTANT NOTICE***
<p>Over the past few months, the Government has been re-evaluating its acquisition approach for the Strategic Automated Command Control System Replacement (SACCS-R) . Your patience during this long and complex process has been appreciated. After extensive analysis concerning program risks and the known/unknown technical gaps, it has been determined to be in the best interest of the Government, and a way forward has been approved, for the SACCS-R Program to be placed on the current Ground Subsystem Support Contract (GSSC). The SACCS Program Team has taken its responsibility to understand this requirement very seriously so that the correct acquisition strategy could be implemented. Contractor input, including an industry day, multiple requests for information (RFI's), and capabilities briefings, have been vital in this process. The Air Force and SACCS-R IPT would like to thank all those vendors who have shown interest and participated in the SACCS-R Program during the market research phase. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact: Shellie Hammond at shellie.hammond@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>1/13/16 Modified NAICs code to 334220 Wireless Communication Equipment Manufacturing<br /><br />Subject: Request for Information for Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Increment 1, 4th Generation Long Term Evolution Cellular Transmission Systems <br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM WIN-T) Increment 1 (Inc 1) seeks industry feedback regarding Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) 4th Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE) cellular transmission systems, a component of the Signal Modernization Program to transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes. The cellular transmission capability must be fully accredited to transport data from multiple security enclaves. LandWarNet capabilities will be augmented through the employment of a deployable cellular transmission system that provides extension for mission command information, to include voice, possibly sensor information, and data to command elements and unit leaders. The cellular transmission infrastructure will provide network extension and flexibility once connected to the tactical network (WIN-T) and possibly to the Soldier level. This capability will be remotely configured, managed and monitored by organic S6/G6 sections and manpower. Cellular capabilities will have cell towers at select network assemblages to provide coverage per local commander's priorities. It shall also potentially be leveraged to provide connections to other wireless systems or enable intelligence capabilities [i.e., Relevant ISR at the Edge (RITE)] to provide extended network range and coverage for Army units.</p>
<p>The cellular modernization capability shall provide data transport, which is integrated, interoperable, and certified to connect to WIN-T networks for network extension (Threshold); provide cellular data transport interoperable with Special Operations Forces (SOF) communications systems and commercial communications architectures for network extension (Objective).<br />This capability will augment the network by bringing tactical single enclave network connectivity to disadvantaged users using cellular data devices fielded at the tactical formation. It shall allow Warfighters to communicate between cellular data devices and specially equipped tactical vehicles outfitted with a cellular base station. These base stations shall be connected to terrestrial transmissions and also to the WIN-T and theater networks. At this time, cellular data devices are not currently supported by WIN-T either while on the move or at the halt. The lack of this capability has been identified as a critical gap in communications that has currently been met by quick reaction capabilities (QRC) systems utilizing commercial off-the-shelf technologies. Incorporating this modernization capability into future WIN-T enabled capability sets will produce a permanent solution that directly links disadvantaged Soldiers at the tactical formation with their expeditionary information network.</p>
<p>PM WIN-T Inc 1 seeks industry feedback regarding availability of a production 4G LTE cellular system that will meet the requirements of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) description included herein. Respondents to this RFI will have the opportunity, if desired, to demonstrate their systems for informal analysis and evaluation in the WIN-T Lab in Building 6010, APG, MD.</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>All submissions in response to this RFI shall include company names, Point of Contact to include, name, position, telephone number and email address. Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI on or before 02 Feb 2016, 1600 Eastern Daylight Time. All responses shall be transmitted electronically to the Contracting Officer, joann.m.mazza.civ@mail.mil, Contract Specialist, colleen.p.dodd.civ@mail.mil and Project Leader, Andre Wiley at andre.l.wiley3@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with product brochures and/or capability statements as well as delivery lead time. All submissions should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 or a compatible format. Responses to this RFI shall be unclassified. Telephone or verbal inquiries regarding this notice will not be honored. All restricted information SHALL be clearly marked. All documentation submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their response to this RFI.<br /><br />See attachment for diagram&emsp;</p>
<p>Cellular System</p>
<p>&bull; Cellular system must separate the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) from eNodeB and Radio Unit for flexibility. The eNodeB and Radio Unit may be combined.<br />&bull; Cellular System must provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Element Management System (EMS) that allows the reconfiguration of the components.<br />&bull; The cellular system must be capable of delivering .5 Mbps upload and 1 Mbps download to at 5 km from transmit antennas on a 15m AGL mast.<br />&bull; The Cellular system and all components should incorporate at a minimum the features in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) LTE Release 10.<br />&bull; The cellular system must support at least 3 sector simultaneous operation and up to six sectors operation.</p>
<p>EPC</p>
<p>&bull; WIN-T EPC should provide one local HSS as per the figure above.<br />&bull; The EPC must have at least three distinct output ports: Management, Signaling, and User Traffic. The three different types of traffic must remain physically separated.<br />&bull; Cellular users must have the ability to roam between different cores and/or different Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs).<br />&bull; EPC should support 3GPP defined sector and site handoff capability.<br />&bull; The EPC must have the ability to be virtualized and be compatible with WIN-T specified hardware. The EPC must be software upgradeable without returning the unit to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>eNodeB</p>
<p>&bull; eNodeB should be ruggedized with a transit case option where no parts exceed a two man lift per MIL-STD-1472 Rev F.<br />&bull; eNodeB should support 192 concurrently connected sessions and 64 concurrently connected sessions per radio if separated.<br />&bull; eNodeB should be software upgradable without returning the unit to the manufacturer.<br />&bull; eNodeB should be able to support all the 3GPP standard channel sizes from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz.<br />&bull; Frequencies (Band X in Figure) required are 3GPP LTE Band 4, 7, 12, 14 and 17. Desired frequencies are 3GPP LTE Band 1, 2, 3, 5, 13 and 20.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: R16PS00237 - Submersible PIT Scanning Units

Amendment No. 0001 - Purpose of this amendment is to provide a closing date to this special notice of January 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM, PST. 

This solicitation is being advertised as a noncompetitive sole source solicitation. As provided under FAR 6.302-1, this project will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

<DESC>GSA Building entrance update - Major construction under the front entrance doors at 1800 F will start January 18 and continue through approximately late May (depending on the weather). The foundation underneath the two-way doors, the revolving door, and the ramp leading to the front entrance will undergo major refurbishment. The doors and ramp will need to be closed, one at a time, while the foundation is repaired. The 100-year-old concrete underneath that area is in need of a 21st century upgrade.
<p>The two-way entrance door closest to 18th Street will be the first doorway to be closed and repaired, followed by the revolving door, and finally the western two-way door and ramp leading to the front entrance. Two front entrance doorways will always be open, with only one under construction at any one time.</p>
<p>If you wish to avoid this inconvenience, consider using the E Street entrance.</p>

<p>Configuration Change Management - Engineering Change Proposal, Requests for Variance (Deviation or Waiver) February 2015<br /><br />1. Requirements<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Configuration Change Management section of SAE EIA-649-1 Configuration Management Requirement for Defense Contracts, Paragraph 3.3, shall be used for Configuration Control of material purchased under this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Furnished item(s) shall conform to the approved configuration requirements/revision specified, unless a Pre-Production Request for Variance (deviation) or a Post-Production Request for Variance (waiver), is processed and approved as provided by Paragraph 3. in this Standard Text Object (STO). Hereafter, the term "Request for Variance (RFV)" will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine. If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation.

<DESC>Amendment #0002

Attached are FAA responses to industry comments.  The FAA will extend the deadline for vendor responses to February 3, 2016, 2:00pm Eastern Standard Time.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Amendment #0001

Questions/requests for clarifications must be received by the Contracting Officer, at dave.keehan@faa.gov, no later than 4:00 P.M Eastern Standard Time on January 6, 2016. The FAA will post to FAACO, by January 11, 2016, answers to all clarification requests. Responses to this RFI/Market Survey are still due no later than 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on January 29, 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Background:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently uses 900 MHz digital microwave radios to support communications requirements within the National Airspace System (NAS). The microwave radios are primarily used in Alaska and can experience severe weather conditions. In most cases, the microwave radios serve as the primary communications medium and must be highly reliable.  

The current model of microwave radios, the GE-MDS LEDR 900S, has reached the end of its operational supportability. The FAA is considering the replacement of the existing microwave radios through a technology-refresh program. 

2.	Purpose:
The FAA is requesting information from providers of digital microwave radio systems as it considers procurement strategies for a possible replacement for existing digital microwave radios. 

3.	Description of the Required Capabilities:
The FAA requires digital microwave radios capable of operating in the existing 932-935 MHz and 941-944 MHz Government Frequency bands. Ideally, the radios will be tunable within these bands by users in the field. The radio must be operable on 120V 60Hz AC power and fit within one rack unit (1.75) of a standard 19 electronics-equipment rack. In addition, the radio must support a minimum radiofrequency (RF) power output of 1 Watt as measured at the transmitters antenna-output port. The FAA desires the radio to be operable with transmit/receive frequency spacing of 9 MHz.

4.	Additional Information:
	This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals. 
	The FAAs issuance of this RFI is not an assurance a procurement will occur.
	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. 
	The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this RFI/Market Survey.
	Any costs associated with the RFI/Market Survey response submittals are solely at the interested partys expense.
	Information provided in response to this RFI/Market Survey is for the FAAs informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  
	Any proprietary information submitted must be marked as such.  

5.	Instructions:
Interested parties should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey / RFI by January 29, 2016:
	A 1-page letter of transmittal on company letterhead that identifies a company point of contact, including name, title, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address;
	A Capabilities Statement of no more than 5 pages (12-point Times New Roman font, 1-inch margins); and
	A completed and signed Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1). 

The Capabilities Statement should include the following information:

A.	Technical Capabilities of the Available Radio Equipment
1.	Provide a brief description of the product potentially offered to meet the requirements described in Section 3 of this RFI / Market Survey.

This non-inherently governmental support area includes day-to-day assistance to management and supporting personnel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Tasks will be primarily performed at NOAA/NESDIS facilities in the Washington, DC metropolitan area (Silver Spring, MD, Suitland, MD, and College Park, MD). However, other support may be required at NOAA Regional sites located within the 48 contiguous states with an emphasis on Boulder, CO, and Asheville, NC. The specific place of performance location information will be provided in each individual task order.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify;">The term of the IDIQ Contract is anticipated to be a </span><strong>one year Base Period from date of award, with three (3) one (1) year option periods</strong><span style="text-align: justify;">. Each task order will have its own completion date established at time of award.&nbsp;All contract work will be issued through individual firm-fixed price, labor-hours, or time-and-materials task orders awarded for corresponding projects. Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own Service Contract Act wage determination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify;">Services will be implemented through individual task orders and will be issued when need arises during the contract period. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered during the performance period of each contract. The Contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This solicitation will be posted <strong>on or about February 1, 2016</strong> on the FedBizOpps website at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">www.fbo.gov</span></a>.

Proposals received in response to the solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in FAR Part 15.1 for Best Value.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Replace/rebuild second story deck on Swissmont hotel building in Stehekin WA.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The hotel was constructed in 1958 as a single-story structure; a full second level and an upper story deck on the lake-facing (south) side were added in 1968.  The building has gone through various remodels since 1968, with the addition of decks for the lower units in the early 1990s as well as remodeling of the staircase on the south side of the building.  This project includes the demolition and replacement of the second floor deck, including steel pipe and tube railing systems, and construction of a new shed roof over a portion of the west elevation.  There will be an option to construct privacy dividers.  The total (existing and reconstructed) deck is approximately 72 feet long, with six rooms opening onto it.  
Additional details are provided in the attached Statement of Work and drawings.  The contractor will have 75 calendar days to complete the construction after the Notice to Proceed is issued.  Construction must be completed by April 29, 2016.
PROJECT LOCATION:  The Swissmont is in Stehekin, WA, in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Stehekin is a remote community located 50 miles from Chelan, Washington, at the north end of Lake Chelan. The Stehekin Valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system.  Stehekin is accessible from Chelan only by boat, barge, or float airplane.  The Swissmont is approximately 200 feet from the ferry landing, adjacent to a road suitable for hauling heavy equipment.  
Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and, if needed, it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge companies before submitting a quote.  Some tools and materials may be sent on the passenger ferry runs, however restrictions apply.  Please contact the ferry and barge companies for more detailed information.
Lodging and meal services in Stehekin will be limited during the period of performance.   Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/stehekin.htm, www.lodgeatstehekin.com, www.stehekinvalley.com, and www.stehekin.com. 
SITE VISIT: A site visit will be held on January 11, 2016, at 12:30 pm.  Contractors will be required to secure their own transportation to and from Stehekin.  There is regular boat service available from Lake Chelan Boat Company (schedules and rates are at www.ladyofthelake.com).  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged so that prospective quoters gain a good understanding of the logistical challenges of this site.
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 and the small business size standard is $36.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $100,000 and $250,000; however, note that the RFQ is being issued using the Simplified Acquisition methods described in FAR Part 13, which are applicable to actions valued under $150,000.  Payment protection (bond or irrevocable letter of credit) will be required after award.  Prior to the solicitation closing date, all offerors must establish and/or maintain an active registration and complete the online representations and certifications at www.SAM.gov.  
Prospective quoters must visit FBO periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no notifications will be sent.   No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however quoters who have not completed the SAM requirements prior to the RFQ due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  
For more information, contact the Contracting Officer at sarah_welch@nps.gov.  The Contracting Officer's mailing address is North Cascades NPS Complex, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley WA  98284.

<DESC>Description: This synopsis is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov. It is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet. The purpose of this amendment is to revise sections 1.3 and 1.4 of the Scope within the Statement of Work (SOW) to clearly define the government's requirement, revise the on-site date, revise the vetting form due date, answer a questions received thru email on 11th and 13th January 2016. In Addition to remove original file name from the attachment. The new on-site visit date is on 9 February 2016, from 0900 ET to 1500 ET. Vendors must attend the on-site visit to have their prospective proposals considered. Vendors will be allowed to perform diagnostics to the equipment. Vendors must be successfully vetted to be able to participate in the on-site visit. Vendors must have a clearance or be in JPAS. Vendors participating in the on-site visit must submit the attached Vetting Form, completely filled out, to Juan Mojica, juan.mojica@navy.mil or Phone (540) 653-4104, no later than 1200ET on 20 January 2016.
<p><br />Questions Received &amp; Answers:</p>
<p>Q1: This gear is all old and there are no more additional FIRMWARE mods coming. Can 1.3 change to just "Maintenance service shall provide coverage for all mechanical, electrical, and electronic components of the equipment in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications.</p>
<p>A1: Yes, per this amendment Scope section 1.3 is amended as stated below.</p>
<p>Q2: It is easy enough to get a tech on-site within 4 hours but it is unreasonable to expect any service provider to meet a 12 hour back to "normal service" for all the equipment listed. This would require significant local sparing of subassembly parts all the way up to full unit replacements for some of the listed gear.</p>
<p>A2: This service interval is changed to reflect 12 to 48 hours as stated below.</p>
<p>Q3: Does the Site visit need to be performed by a cleared representative?</p>
<p>A3: Yes, the representative has to be cleared for the site visit.</p>
<p>Q4: Is the list covered now?</p>
<p>A4: No, there is no warranty coverage on these items.</p>
<p>Q5: Are all the devices running fine?</p>
<p>A5: Yes, to the best of our knowledge that's why there is a site visit to give everyone an opportunity to check the equipment for themselves.</p>
<p>Q6: "There will be an on-site visit on 26 January 2016, from 0900 ET to 1500 ET." Are those the hours the site is open for visits OR is that the schedule for an all-day site tour? I am trying to figure out if this is a 1 hour "meet-and-greet" (anytime during that day) or a 6 hour guided tour though the facility.</p>
<p>A6. The facility is going to be open from 0900 ET to 1500 ET. Take as much time that you need during the site visit hours to allow you as the offer enough information to create an adequate proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Delete:</p>
<p>&bull; 1.3 Maintenance service shall provide coverage for all mechanical, electrical, and electronic components of the equipment in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications. Maintenance shall include any firmware installation required as part of remedial service to restore the equipment to the previous operational state. The contractor shall notify the government when a firmware upgrade is required.</p>
<p>&bull; 1.4 The preventive maintenance and on-call remedial maintenance requires the contractor to respond to onsite calls for service within four (4) hours and return the equipment to normal service (i.e. return the hardware and operating system to regular operation) within twelve (12) hours from the time service is requested. The Contractor shall provide on-call maintenance services during Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM), 0700-2100, Monday through Friday (not including Federal Government holidays).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.) Insert:</p>
<p>1.3 Maintenance service shall provide coverage for all mechanical, electrical, and electronic components of the equipment in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications.</p>
<p>1.4 The preventive maintenance and on-call remedial maintenance requires the contractor to respond to onsite calls for service within four (4) hours and return the equipment to normal service (i.e. return the hardware and operating system to regular operation) within forty-eight (48) hours from the time service is requested. The Contractor shall provide on-call maintenance services during Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM), 0700-2100, Monday through Friday (not including Federal Government holidays).</p>
<p>3.) Change electronic file name as follows:<br /><br />- From: Copy of Revised RDTTS Equipment 1001-04 (FY16) - PPM Services - Equipment List</p>
<p>- To: N00178P0038, Attachment Equipment List J.1</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334513,  with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees for an upcoming requirement for the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO 80225 to provide PALL WATER FILTERS; Brand Name or Equal to Brand Name Salient Characteristics.  


Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR). The NMR allows a small business to offer a product that it did not manufacturer under a small business set-aside if Small Business Administration (SBA) has offered a waiver.  SBA does not offer a waiver for these supplies.  On a supply contract, a firm must perform at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials). The NMR is an exception to the performance requirements, and provides that a firm that is not a manufacturer may qualify as a small business on a supply contract set aside for small business if, among other things, it supplies the product of a small business made in the United States.  The Brand Name supplies are not made by a small business in the United States.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.

This requirement is for water filters which are equal to the attached Brand Name Salient Characteristics.

The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.

Responses to this announcement are requested from Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 334513 if their AVERAGE annual number of employees for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to 500 employees. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from small business firms, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Interested small business firms who feel that they can provide the filters that meet or exceed the attached Brand Name Salient Characteristics (based upon the criteria specified), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response must include references with contact names, email addresses, and phone numbers. These references are to be for contracts similar in scope as the contract under consideration. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  

Small business firms who feel they can provide the filters shall also submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER);  and (2) their SIZE STATUS.   Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line in the System for Award Management (SAM) found at www.sam.gov. You will also be required to provide your small business status information with your SAM registration at the SAM website, www.sam.gov, before an award to your company can be made. Your active SAM registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government.

All responses must be submitted NLT xx/xx/xxxx at x:00pm MST via e-mail to: xxx@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (Fedbizopps.gov) website and no paper copies will be provided.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). This notice of intent applies to five separate actions.
<p>The Government has requirements described below that have been supported under our Global Battlestaff and Program Support (GBPS) contracts since 2010. These requirements were scheduled to be among the first requirements to transition to our SOF-Wide Mission Support (SWMS) Group A contracts. Due to an extended acquisition timeline and multiple protests, SWMS Group A is not yet available. The contracted services described below are mission critical and this support cannot lapse. As such, the Government intends to issue four purchase orders to bridge this critical support for a period of 6 months allowing the SWMS Group A contracts to clear protests. The purchase orders will be issued under NAICS 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>The requirements are:</p>
<p>(1) JMISC Subject Matter Expert Support. The purchase order will be issued to CAC International, 8618 Westwood Center Dr. STE 200, Vienna VA 22182-3818. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $274K.</p>
<p>(2) J-3 CIP. The purchase order will be issued to Jacobs Technology, Inc., 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Suite 900, Tampa, FL 33609. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $300K.</p>
<p>(3) J-3 Global Analysis Support. The purchase order will be issued to SRA International, Inc., 4300 Fair Lakes Ct., Fairfax, VA 22033. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $267k.</p>
<p>(4) PEO RW Support. The purchase order will be issued to Jacobs Technology, Inc., 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Suite 900, Tampa, FL 33609. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $419k.</p>
<p>(5) SOFM Support. The purchase order will be issued to SRA International, Inc., 4300 Fair Lakes Ct., Fairfax, VA 22033. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $254k.</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within seven days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A change in the strategy detailed above based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<RESPDATE>011516
<CONTACT>Jennifer White, Contract Specialist, Phone 9104513096, Email jennifer.l.white@usmc.mil
<DESC><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />RFQ M67001-16-Q-0040<br />Steam Plant Chemicals</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2 Technical Requirements. b). Sodium sulfite oxygen scavenger - are you requesting a dry or liquid based sulfite? If dry do you have mix tanks? You do want catalyzed sodium sulfite, correct?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We are requesting dry sulfite treatment. Yes, catalyzed sodium sulfite. We have batch tanks for mixing dry sulfite at the larger plants.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Section 2.1.9.4 Weekly. Are routine service visits at a weekly interval? *as an example per month: large steam plants week 1, small steam plants group A week 2, small steam plants group B week 3, hot water boilers (first 20) week 4 *hot water boilers would be checked monthly at 20 site intervals....month 1 - 20, month 2 - 20, month 3 - 20, month 4 - 20, month 5 - 20, month 6 - none (repeat for months 7 - 12 to get the loops checked twice annually)</p>
<p>ANSWER: Routine service visits are weekly for steam plant monitoring and treatment only. We would like our treatment inventory monitored and maintained so that we don't run out of treatment. The example above is good for routine visits. Our current contractor tests the steam supply and condensate return systems at least monthly. This has worked well for us.<br />We would expect the contractor to inform operations and the chemist of any plant related issues they might find. This may include visiting and testing one or more plants multiple times to help resolve any issues.</p>
<p>Hot water boiler monitoring by the contractor is not included in this contract. This contract covers chemical supply and test kits and reagents for hot water boiler systems.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Section 2.2 Equipment Requirements 2.2.2 - Should these tanks be double walled tanks (self-contained) and will they be located inside or outside?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We currently have both inside and outside tanks. Outside tanks are double walled except where they have secondary containment. Inside or outside tanks installed under this contract should be double walled. The Environmental Management Division MCBCL specifies storage tanks 50 gal. and above be double walled or have secondary containment.</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2.2.3 - How many chemical feed pumps will need to be replaced and are these to be included in the fixed price?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Currently there are no chemical feed pumps that need to be replaced. Price of pumps will be included in the fixed price.<br /><br />QUESTION: 2.2.4 - How many neat chemical feed tanks and pumps for future small plants will there be and are these to be included in the fixed price?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We have plans for 7 new steam plants to go online in the future. This should include 14 chemical tanks and 14 chemical pumps. These should be included in the fixed price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2.2.5 - Is the heat tracing to be included in the fixed price and if so is there a specific scope / # locations / etc.?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Heat tracing will be included in the fixed price if required. We have been able in the past to place our treatments inside plants to avoid freezing. We don't have a specific scope or location where heat tracing may be required in the future.</p>
<p>QUESTION: (4) Service. h &amp; j state to provide 8 combined water test kits and 8 conductivity meters, but in 2.1.11 &amp; 2.1.13 it states to provide 6 of each?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Please provide 6 combined test kits and 6 conductivity meters.</p>
<p>QUESTION: (5) Equipment. Do the tanks have to be stainless?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Tanks do not need to be stainless unless required for storage of treatment or required for chemical feed.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Install stainless chemical feed piping, valves and gauges for bulk neat feed. In section 2.2 Equipment Requirements it states **The Government will install and maintain feed lines pertaining to all chemical pumps included in this contract**. Just some clarification on whose responsibility this will be?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Feed lines will be the responsibility of the government.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you know if liquid for powdered sulfite is required? The other chemicals are all liquid as the unit of measure is gallons, but the sulfite unit of measure is pounds. The problem is that sometimes liquids are priced in pounds also.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Solid sulfite.<br /><br />Additional QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />RFQ M67001-16-Q-0040<br />Steam Plant Chemicals</p>
<p>QUESTION: The main question that we have regarding the bid is about the products you are requesting. I see you show quantities but there is nothing stating the active ingredient and the % active of the products. Can you tell us for each product what that is? Or if you have Safety Data sheets on the<br />materials we should be able to get the information from there.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The treatments are listed in UFC 3-240-13FN Unified Facilities Criteria Industrial Water Treatment Operation and Maintenance. There may be other information in the ASME documents.<br />An appendix in the UFC gives examples of these treatments. Some are also available on GSA. SDS forms can be found online at GSA or most chemical treatment sites. They may also be available from boiler manufacturer's sites. We do not have SDS forms from DOD.</p>
<p>The active ingredients are:<br />&bull;Amine mixture of morpholine, DEAE (Diethylaminoethanol) and cyclohexylamine for steam and condensate pH control<br />&bull;Sulfite mixture catalyzed, sodium sulfite with sodium metabisulfite as an oxygen scavenger<br />&bull;Phosphate: a polyphosphate used to precipitate solids in the boiler<br />&bull;Combined treatment will include all these together or some combination<br />&bull;Nitrite is typically a nitrite-azole borate combination for hot water heating systems<br />Concentrations may vary with manufacturer.</p>

Palafox St., Pensacola, FL with ultimate disposal at the Perdido Landfill, 13009 Beulah Road, Cantonment, FL.  Refuse from the Gulf Islands National Seashore Gulf Breeze, Naval Live Oaks and Santa Rosa Area will be transported to the Santa Rosa Landfill located at 6337 Da Lisa Road, Milton, FL.

Currently, recycling options in the area around the Gulf Islands National Seashore include recycling of paper and cardboard only.  The Emerald Coast Utility Authority (ECUA) has announced plans to build a Recycling Process Facility at the Perdido Landfill in 2016; however, specific details are not yet available.  Thus, this eight-month period of performance under this contract includes recycling for paper and cardboard only.  Paper and Cardboard recycle material from all Gulf Islands National Seashore sites will be transported to the Republic Services Pensacola Recycling Center located at 3015 N. Palafox Street, Pensacola, FL.  Paper and cardboard recycling containers will only be provided in 6-yard and 8-yard size containers.  Portable and divided containers are not included.  Additional 6-yard and 8-yard recycle containers are available upon request for an additional, nominal fee.

<ARCHDATE>02132016
<DESC>Limited Sources Justification or <br />Sole Source Justification<br />for Acquisitions under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold<br />(Simplified Acquisition Threshold is $150K)
<p><br />1. Contracting Activity: This requirement is for William Beaumont Army Medical Center (WBAMC), 5005 North Piedras, El Paso, TX 79920. The contracting activity is the Regional Health Contracting Office - Central. The Solicitation number is W91YU0-16-T-0018.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action:</p>
<p>Requirement: 0 New 1 Repeat<br />Pricing: 1 Firm-Fixed Price 0 Time &amp; Materials 0 Cost<br />Funds: 0 OMA 1 Other Funds: DHP Total Dollar Value: $ 114,734 <br /><br />Name of Intended Contractor:<br />POC: DiaSorin, Inc.<br />David Trinh<br />Street Address: 1951 Northwestern Ave.<br />City, State, Zip: Stillwater, MN 55082<br />Phone: 812-276-1574</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: This requirement is for fully random access to the DiaSorin chemiluminescent system, leased by WBAMC, for Vitamin D, Insulin, and Varicella-zoster virus testing reagents. The estimated total is $114,734 for the one year contract. This contract will be 1 November 2015 - 31 October 2016.</p>
<p>4. Authority Cited: <br /><br />1 (a) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): Only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, brand name or industrial mobilization); OR</p>
<p>0 (b) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(ii): Only one source can provide a portion of the purchase that is a particular brand-name item; OR<br /><br />0 (c) FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A): An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays; OR</p>
<p>0 (d) FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B): Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; OR</p>
<p>0 (e) FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C): In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. <br />(1 October 2015)</p>
<p><br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: WBAMC currently leases the DiaSorin equipment in the Pathology Department. The requirement is for the testing reagents for Vitamin D, Insulin, and Varcella-zoster for an estimated total of $114,734. As stated by DiaSorin, their reagents are the only source that are authorized on the machines. No other reagents are compatible with the DiaSorin equipment.</p>
<p>6. Actions to Increase Competition: As long as WBAMC leases the equipment from DiaSorin, competition will be restricted as DiaSorin has proprietary rights to this equipment and the reagents that are used. However, when WBAMC moves into the new hospital, there will be new opportunities for competition at that time. This follow-on contract will expire on 31 October 2016.<br />7. Market Survey: This is for use in the Department of Pathology for more efficient cost per test and faster turnaround time. The contractor provides a DiaSorin Liasion Analyzer that is the only fully random access chemiluminescent system in the market that does Vitamin D testing, is FDA approved, and is allowing the treatment facilities to validate the instrument testing values to other FDA treatment facilities. Market research, completed on 7 October 2015, verifies that these supplies are offered on the commercial market. Companies generally engaged in providing these types of services are Quest and Roche. Quest can only provide reference testing from a patient sample and Roche does not have a Chemiluminescent system that can provide vitamin D testing. It will be more advantageous to the government to provide better, faster and less expensive testing for patient diagnosis. The DiaSorin analyzers are leased by the government. DiaSorin provided a statement as to why they believe they are the only organization who can provide these reagents. They stated "Please be advised that DiaSorin is the sole provider of service, including installation, preventative maintenance, software updates, and repairs for the LIASON&reg; Chemiluminescent Analyzer which is used in conjunction with the following reagents: 310600 LIASON 25OH Vitamin D Total, 310601 LIASON Control 250H Vitamin D, 310360 LIASON Insulin, 310361 LIASON Control Insulin, 310495 LIASON VZV IgG, and 310496 LIASON Control VZV IgG. In addition, DiaSorin is the sole manufacturer of the reagents listed."<br />8. Procurement History:</p>

<DESC>Mod 008 was issued to extend the period of performance to allow GSA sufficient time to compete the follow-on task order.
<p>The action being approved is a single source (Limited Source Justification) for a firm-fixed price type task order under the GSA Information Technology 70 Services (IT 70) Schedule contract. This extension will allow for contractor support for the following periods of performance:</p>
<p>Option Period 3 Extension Base:	10 January 2016 through 09 March 2016<br />Option Period 3 Extension Optional:	10 March 2016 through 09 April 2016</p>
<p>GSA's acquisition strategy is to competitively source the follow-on requirement using the GSA IT 70 Schedule Contract while providing fair opportunity to all small businesses holding an IT 70 Schedule contract.</p>
<p>DHIMS has an on-going need for IT support services for the continued Tier III help desk management, trouble ticket tracking and data reconciliation supporting the Military Health System (MHS) to ensure the Nation has available at all times a healthy fighting force and the ability to support DoD missions worldwide.  Continuing this IT support is essential to the success of DHIMS's mission.</p>
<p>The extension is required to provide the Government sufficient time to adequately conduct the recompete acquisition and to avoid a break in service which will be detrimental to the DHIMS mission and operations.</p>
