<DESC>This synopsis is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.207 and is being issued pursuant to the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) W91QUZ-10-R-0034.<BR><BR>This requirement is to provide the Software Engineering Center (SEC), Fort Lee, Virginia (SEC-Lee) contractor support to allow the Standard Army Maintenance System  Enhanced (SAMS-E) to act as the bridge between current functionality and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.  SAMS-E is the automation of maintenance systems initiatives under the Modular Force concept. The Modular Force concept transitions maintenance in the Army from a four-level system to a two-level maintenance (TLM) system.  To accomplish revised maintenance automation, SAMS-E replaces Unit Level Logistic System  Ground (ULLS-G), SAMS-1, SAMS-2, and SAMS-I/TDA (SAMS-Installation/Table of Distribution and Allowances) by incorporating the Microsoft (MS) Windows XP graphical user interface (GUI) operating systems (OS), and Oracle Database Management System (DBMS), to satisfy Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA), Deputy Chief of Staff Operations (G3)/Network Condition (NETCON) Directive to move all systems from MS Disk Operating System (DOS), Windows 2000 and Windows NT; and merge ULLS-G functionality into SAMS-E. This is a maintenance systems modernization initiative that allows SAMS-E to act as a bridge between legacy functionality and the Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-Army) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.  <BR><BR>This acquisition may require the Contractor to provide functional and technical software development support for system enhancements such as Ground Systems Digital Logbook.  Major system enhancements shall be used as a part of the SAMS-E baseline, and to preserve system capability by avoiding obsolescence and associated sustainment problems.<BR><BR>The contractor may be required to perform a full range of services to include; project management; fielding, implementation, training, data conversion, functional and technical software development and sustainment, which includes requirements determination, configuration management, testing, security training, documentation and customer assistance. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide program security management support and information vulnerability management support necessary to sustain, modify, and improve the deployed systems operational software.<BR><BR>The SEC-LEE in coordination with the Army Contracting Command, National Capital Region Contracting Center (NCRCC) intends to release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SAMS-E requirement on 12 April 2010.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to provide constructive comments to the draft RFP.  In order for comments to be considered, they must be received prior to the posting of the final RFP.  It is anticipated that the final RFP will be posted on 5 May 2009.  All dates are subject to change.  All comments to the draft RFP should be directed via electronic mail to the Contracting Officer, William L. Giles at william.L.giles@us.army.mil, or Contract Specialists, Neal Dedicatoria at neal.dedicatoria@us.army.mil and Undra Robinson II at undra.robinsonii@us.army.mil.  Prospective Offerors will not be reimbursed for submission of comments. <BR><BR>This acquisition will be conducted under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procedures. A performance-based Time and Materials type contract will be used as the cost variables involved for some of the support services do not allow the Government to estimate future costs with sufficient accuracy. The resultant SAMS-E contract will have a twelve (12) month base period and two (2) one-year option periods, with performance within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) (Germany, Italy, Puerto Rico, Republic of Korea, Iraq & Afghanistan). The total estimated value for the SAMS-E requirement is $71.0 million.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the SAMS-E acquisition is 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services) under Sector 54  Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a small business size standard of $25.0 million.<BR><BR>Offerors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award.

<SOLNBR>9368
<RESPDATE>041710
<ARCHDATE>05022010
<CONTACT>Jason Kuo, 609-485-6687

<a href="mailto:jason.kuo@faa.gov">jason.kuo@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>OVERVIEW.
The Federal Aviation Administration seeks to procure a collimated visual system for its B-737-800 cockpit simulator to enhance the realism of the flight experience.  The system is to provide collimate light for accurate distance estimation, and cross cockpit viewing.  It must do this without requiring special glasses to be worn by the flight crew.  
Based on market research of available systems, it is believed that the optimum solution for a collimated visual system is the standard industry solution of a large mirror reflecting the image from a rear projection screen located above the cockpit windows.  However, all offeror's proposals will be considered provided that the offeror can clearly demonstrate within the proposal that their solution does collimate light from the image source, allows cross cockpit viewing, and does not require special viewing apparatus.  
This acquisition includes the major physical components of the visual system including mirror cell, rear projection screen, projectors and projector mounting systems, light tightening structure, and image blending system.  The image generator portion of the system is supplied by the FAA.
Successful vendors will be required to install and align their visual system on the FAA cockpit.  The FAA will have available sufficient image generator computers to drive the visual system, and will ensure that adequate base support is provided for the screen structure.
The FAA cockpit is a fixed base device, i.e., is not mounted on a motion platform.  Therefore, structure rigidity and stiffness need not be adequate for motion platforms.
The visual system shall meet the requirements for a Level D simulator, per FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 Revision B, dated July 29, 1991, and JAR-STD-01A Amendment 3.  
Offerors are invited to submit their cost and technical proposals to the point of contact at the end of this RFP.  This is best value procurement.  The two factors are Cost and Technical Qualifications.  Technical Qualifications are considered more important than cost.  A contract award will be made based on the information in Offerors' proposals submitted in response to this RFP.  
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. 
Field of View.  The system shall provide a viewing field of view (FOV) of not less than 1800 x 400.  Offerors should indicate if their system meets or exceeds this FOV.
Collimation Distance.  The system shall provide a collimation distance of greater than 10 meters over the viewing volume.
Vergence.  Image divergence from the Design Eye Point shall be less than 7 milliradians.Geometric Distortion.  The total geometric distortion error including horizontal and vertical error shall be less than 1.66% of the total horizontal Field of view.
Viewing Volume.  The viewing volume shall be not less than a 5" sphere around the pilots and co-pilots reference eye points.
Projector Performance.  The projector resolution shall be HD compatible (1920 x 1080) or better with sufficient light output to achieve Level D performance for daylight operations.  These projectors are available from COTS sources.
DELIVERABLES.
The deliverables include:

<DESC>Subject: NASA Discovery Program Announcement of OpportunityNASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release an Announcement ofOpportunity (AO) for Discovery Program missions no earlier than (NET) June 2010. TheDiscovery Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigationsin SMDs planetary programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap. It is anticipated thatapproximately two to three Discovery investigations will be selected for 9-month Phase Aconcept studies through this AO. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it isplanned that one Discovery investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B andsubsequent mission phases. There will be no Missions of Opportunity (MO) solicited aspart of this AO. All MO are now solicited through the Stand Alone Missions of OpportunityNotice (SALMON) AO.The AO will differ in the following significant ways from the Draft Discovery Program AO(NNH10ZDA003J) released in December 2009:	Launch vehicles in the medium and high performance classes with 4m fairingswill be added as options. Costs to proposers for these options are currently beingassessed.	Proposed missions will be required to be compatible through PDR with threefamilies of launch vehicles: Atlas V, Delta IV, and Falcon 9.	The minimum requirements for taking advantage of technology-infusion cost capincentives will be detailed in a new document in the Program Library entitled In-SpacePropulsion Technologies Minimum Demonstration Requirements.	The costs associated with NEPA, NLSA, and nuclear launch services for missionsproposing to use ASRGs will be reduced to a firm, fixed cost of $20M (FY10).	The justification for the use of X-band telecommunications for science datadownlink will be clarified to explicitly follow Recommendation 23-1 of the SpaceFrequency Coordination Group: in deep-space X-band users will be limited to 12 MHz ofbandwidth while at Mars X-band users will be limited to 8 MHz of bandwidth.  Beyond theselimits, missions will be required to use Ka-band. Aperture fees based on the standardformula will remain.	Missions to the Martian surface will no longer be required to carry theElectra-lite UHF radio package. However, any UHF package used will be required to beinteroperable with the current Mars UHF relay network.	The latest allowable Launch Readiness Date (LRD) will be extended to December 31,2017.The schedule for the solicitation is intended to be:Release of final AO (target) - NET June 2010Pre-proposal conference - ~3 weeks after final AO releaseProposals due - 90 days after AO releaseSelection for competitive Phase A studies - March 2011 (target)Concept study reports due - February 2012 (target)Down-selection - July 2012 (target)Launch readiness date - NLT December 31, 2017The Draft Discovery AO is available by following the links athttp://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/     . Proposers should read the Discovery AO carefullywhen it is released.NASA has not approved the issuance of the Discovery AO and this notification does notobligate NASA to issue the AO and solicit proposals. The release date is subject toongoing budget formulation activities. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators inpreparing submissions in response to this notification or the Draft Discovery AO areincurred completely at the submitter's own risk.Further information will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition Page athttp://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/     as it becomes available.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, NATIONAL BUSINESS CENTER, ACQUISITION SERVICES DIRECTORATE, BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) FARM SERVICE AGENCY (FSA) ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) REQUIREMENTS.
The scope of work includes the following:
The objective of this task order is to develop an enterprise data strategy to plan for improving the way the Farm Service Agency (FSA) leverages its data, allowing the government to turn data into information and knowledge which, in turn, produces measurable improvements in business performance and optimizes the way the agency fulfills its mission. The agency mission is to equitably serve all farmers, ranchers, and agricultural partners by delivering effective, efficient agricultural programs for all Americans.  The agency supports four major program areas (Farm Loans, Income Support and Disaster Assistance, Conservation, and Commodity Operations) with approximately 90 systems. 
The enterprise data strategy is a critical aspect of FSA's overall approach to strategic information technology. The enterprise data strategy will encompass enterprise data architecture, enterprise data management, and an enterprise analytic capability, along with action plans or roadmaps for implementation.  The enterprise data architecture will focus on data structure, storage, access, and movement of data throughout the enterprise.  The architecture will include current state assessments composed of business domain models, data analysis and definition, data relationships, identification of authoritative data sources, and data flows.  The architecture will include future state models depicting the to-be data architecture for FSA modernization initiatives and will include master data, metadata, data security, data retention and deletion policies, business process integration, design standards and guidelines, configuration management and capacity planning, and data taxonomy.  The architecture will include a gap analysis and transition plans to be used as the roadmap for attaining the future state. The key components of enterprise data management are data governance and data quality.  Data governance will include data policies and procedures, access rights management, governance processes, change management, workflow and collaboration, definition of data producers and consumers, data owners, data stewards, a data governance council, data rules library, and identity and access management technology.  Data quality will focus on metrics management, data standards and rules, data cleansing standards, extraction transformation and load (ETL), data monitoring, and audit reports. Enterprise analytic capability is based on business intelligence and will include query and reporting, research and analysis, business process flows, metrics management and KPI's, multi-dimensional analysis, data mining and analytics tools, enterprise data warehouse functionality, and a BI competency center with a BI tool suite.

<DESC>The Navy has an immediate and urgent maintenance and flight operations requirement for the T-34 at the Chief of Naval Air Training Command; specifically at Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi and NAS Whiting Field, with possible services provided at NAS Pensacola. As part of this requirement, the contractor will provide supplemental services to the current Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contractor, Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. SSSI currently provides CLS to the T-34, T-44 and T-6 training programs. The period of performance for this effort will begin on approximately 30 April 2010, with flight operations and maintenance activities to commence in May 2010. This effort will continue through 30 April 2011, with a six month option to 30 September 2011. This requirement may include the T-44 and T-6 platforms as well. The main intent of this requirement is to bring unflyable aircraft up to flying status, and to thereafter maintain the aircraft in flyable condition to make them continuously available for use until the pilot training schedule is restored. The single most important performance objective is providing airworthy aircraft to meet the daily flight schedule (DFS) to enable full flight operations. If the Navy does not procure this requirement within the required timeframe, there will be a significant negative impact on Naval Air Readiness.
<p>This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC, Madison, MS on an other than full and open competitive basis per FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with L-3 to procure their services as stated above. L-3 Vertex possesses the on-site facilities, management infrastructure, and knowledge/experience to quickly and properly support the Navy's immediate and urgent requirement. L-3 is the only maintenance provider aside from the incumbent that is onsite at NAS Whiting Field, NAS Corpus Christi and NAS Pensacola and therefore the only company that can meet the Navy's requirement within the timeframe required. An award to any other company would result in an unacceptable delay to fulfilling the Navy's requirement.</p>
<p>Concurrently with this requirement, the Navy will conduct the full and open competition for the larger Contractor Logistics Services requirement (organizational, intermediate and depot level maintenance) for the T-34, T-44 and T-6 programs. The Navy intends to compete and award this requirement by April 2011. Additional information will be available via FEDBIZOPPS within the next several weeks. For further information about the full and open competition, please contact Jessica McGee or Vicki Ganley, contract specialists, via e-mail at jessica.mcgee@navy.mil or vicki.ganley@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with PhycoTech Inc, to provide Aquatic Flora Identification and Measurement for the Shepherd Creek Best Management Practice Services within Twelve (12) months following theaward of contract with an optional second period, for the Office of Research & Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Lab (NRMRL), Sustainable Technology Division (STD) located in Cincinnati, OH.
   EPA has identified PhycoTech Inc. as the only provider of commercial services able to meet the requirements of this procurement. PhycoTech Inc. is the only known source able to satisfy the Governments requirement because PhycoTech Inc. has unique capabilities that are specific to the taxonomist(s) on staff conducting the identification, and no other contractor with the required expertise and experience exists.  This unique capability is essential for performance, because these new samples will be compared to those identified under the existing contract to determine how the Shepherd Creek assemblages differ from other streams within the county with various levels of urbanization disturbance.  Consistency in taxonomic identification throughout the sampling period is critical to the successful completion of the project.
   This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Kathleen Rechenberg at the above address or by fax to 513-487-2853 or by e-mail to rechenberg.kathleen@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving white papers for Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal Applied Research Science and Technology (S&T) Projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of EOD operations. 
 
ONR has a need to develop and demonstrate technologies to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, and render safe/neutralize Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) to support the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) mission.    
   
The EOD mission is to render safe ordnance, including conventional and unconventional, improvised, chemical, biological, and nuclear IEDs and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). It includes land and underwater location, identification, render-safe, and recovery (or disposal) of foreign and domestic ordnance.  EOD conducts demolition of hazardous munitions, pyrotechnics, and retrograde explosives using detonation and burning techniques. The EOD mission is unique from the role of other forces, such as combat engineers that support movement of US and allied forces.      

An IED is a device placed in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It can include military stores, but normally is devised from non-military components.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS), Office on Women’s Health (OWH), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Management, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Alabaster Place, Inc, 4265 Brownsboro Road, Suite 206, Winston-Salem, NC 27106.

The primary purpose of this contract is for the development of a method/approach which will meet the needs of women of faith who experience gender-based violence and to implement programs within a targeted faith community in a specific geographical area to increase the participation of the faith community in prevention and intervention activities focused on areas under the auspices of Violence Against Women (domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, etc). 

The Office on Women’s Health requires the services of a Contractor for training and development, to participate in our pilot Women of Faith Advocacy initiative which is designed to meet the needs of women who are victims of gender-based violence and identify themselves as members of a faith community. This program will focus specifically on issues related to domestic violence through awareness and prevention education activities for the members of the faith community at-large.

Implement the Power to Intervene and Prevent Abuse Program Series, an advocacy
training session, for women who identify themselves as members of a faith community  	

Build capacity for faith-based organizations to address the needs of women who are 
affected by gender-based violence otherwise referred to as areas under the auspices of 
Violence Against Women. To this end, the vendor will develop partnerships and linkages 
between the local organizations which provide services and resources to women who are 
victims of gender-based violence and build brokering relationships to identify, locate and 
link available resources to the faith based community 

Develop a training guide for female lay leaders in the faith community  	

Collaborate with other pilot program partners and OWH staff to create a universal curriculum

Implement a local evaluation and participate in a multi-site evaluation focused on the
effectiveness of the Office on Women’s Health Pilot Women of Faith Advocacy
Initiative

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to
solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest
by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this
notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified
acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the
government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:<BR><BR>This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will take procurement action in this matter.  Neither PM FSS nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.<BR><BR>PM FSS is interested in understanding the currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of remote operating bases engaged in combat operations.  This RFI focuses on technologies and equipment that address two areas of interest:<BR>1) add-on components that improve the energy efficiency of existing shelters and shelter systems; and <BR>2) energy efficient structures and/or shelters to replace existing systems.  <BR>Technologies of interest are those that would most effectively reduce the energy demand of a base camp supporting 150 personnel and a base camp supporting 50 personnel.  Information is requested in the form of brief product descriptions.  <BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These base camps are currently heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by bottled water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.  <BR><BR>PM FSS is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the logistics support required to establish and operate base camps.  The information received in response to this RFI may be used to help identify technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing energy-related base camp operations.  Information received may ultimately result in requests for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at no cost or risk to the Government, possibly as early as June 2010.<BR><BR>INFORMATION OF INTEREST:<BR><BR>Add-on components that improve the energy efficiency of existing shelters and shelter systems:  The need to rapidly establish base camps has resulted in the use of shelter systems that are designed and constructed on an expedient basis, using unit organic and service provided equipment and systems.  The shelter commonly being used is the TEMPER (Airbeam supported), Type XXXI (32 ft) tent, as well as TEMPER (Airbeam) Types XXXIV, XXXVII, and XXXVIII to lesser extents.  The heating/cooling equipment commonly being used are militarized environmental control units and heaters.  These expeditionary shelter systems provide support necessary to receive, bed-down, and support operations of deployed forces.  This standard is tied to a minimum military requirement to support a mission, but results in the extended use of expeditionary shelter systems that are less than optimal from an energy perspective.  This places a considerable burden on fuel usage for heating and cooling equipment operate to cool or heat interior spaces and for ancillary powered equipment.  One approach has been to spray tents with insulating foam.  While this solution dramatically improves the tent's insulation, it also prevents the tent from ever being disassembled and redeployed.  Alternative approaches for improving the current unit organic and service provided shelter systems are sought.<BR><BR>Mature technologies and products that can provide the following capabilities are of interest:<BR><BR>1.  Reusable insulation solutions for the current shelters<BR>2.  Renewable power solutions<BR>3.  Energy efficient heating and/or cooling solutions<BR>4.  Energy efficient lighting solutions<BR>5.  Shading solutions<BR>6.  Generators capable of operating from a variety of thermal sources including combustion of logistic fuels, combustion of locally produced bio-fuels, incineration of trash or concentrated solar radiation<BR> <BR>Energy efficient structures and/or shelters to replace existing systems:  The need to rapidly establish base camps has resulted in the use of shelter systems that are designed and constructed on an expedient basis, using unit organic and service provided equipment and systems.  These expeditionary shelter systems provide support necessary to receive, bed-down, and support operations of deployed forces.  This standard is tied to a minimum military requirement to support a mission, but results in the extended use of expeditionary shelter systems that are less than optimal from an energy perspective.  Alternative shelter system solutions with improved energy efficiency are sought to replace the current unit organic and service provided shelter systems.<BR><BR>Mature technologies and products that can provide the following capabilities are of interest:<BR><BR>1.  Lightweight mobile thermally insulated structures (with or without included alternative power generation systems, energy efficient heating and/or cooling systems, energy efficient lighting)<BR>	a) Structures with standard NEC electrical outlets and able to run an electrical chase for lighting and HVAC<BR>	b) Structures able to accept commercial power or from a standard military generator set<BR><BR>These systems must be able to withstand the durability and structural load demands of military shelters to include extreme environmental conditions and rough handling.<BR><BR>CONTENT AND FORMAT OF PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS:<BR><BR>The electronic copy of responses is to be in Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Acrobat 9 compatible format using a size 12 font with one inch margins. Following a review of the responses received, PM FSS may elect to request additional information, or schedule one-on-one meetings with some respondents to gain additional information about their proposed solution(s). A submission should include:<BR>1. A cover letter (optional)<BR>2. A cover page labeled with the heading Expeditionary Shelter System Product Description, including the product name, the manufacturer, manufacturers address, technical point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address, and at least one photograph of the item.<BR>3. No more than three pages including:<BR>	a) Product technical description<BR>	b) Narrative describing how the product could enhance the energy self-sufficiency of a small base camp<BR>	c) Product specifications with particular emphasis on quantitative metrics of energy consumption or savings over alternative solutions. Other specifications would include parameters such as dimensions, weight, capacities, input requirements, salient output capabilities, or other quantitative characteristics as appropriate.<BR>	d) Identify all tools and equipment required to set up and take down/pack<BR>	e) Transportation requirements and limitations<BR>	f) Manpower required setting up and taking down/pack<BR>	g) Relevant history of product (or similar product) utilization<BR>	h) Catalog price or rough estimate of unit cost<BR>	i) Earliest availability for a product demonstration at no cost or risk to the Government<BR><BR>SUBMISSION DATE AND ADDRESS:<BR><BR>Electronic responses to this notice are requested to be emailed to dean.klopotoski@us.army.mil no later than Friday, April 30, 2010, 5pm EST.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA, to identify sources with the capability to rapidly design and manufacture an expendable gliding decelerator system compatible with the Armys current Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System, 2,000 Pound (JPADS 2K).<BR><BR>The gliding decelerator system must be capable of being deployed at up to 18,000 ft MSL (threshold) and 25,000 ft MSL (objective) from USAF cargo aircraft, with a lift to drag ratio of 3.2 to 1 and sufficiently robust to safely deliver a 1000  1850 lb (threshold) and 500  2200 pound (objective) payload with a reliability of 92% with a 90% confidence and interface with the JPADS 2K Airborne Guidance Unit (AGU).<BR><BR>The current JPADS 2K gliding decelerator system is comprised of a 1025 sq ft. semi-elliptical parafoil that is deployed by a static line initiated drogue parachute.   <BR>The two basic problems with re-using parafoils in an operational environment are recovery and material damage. Since the systems are typically used in areas inaccessible by ground vehicles, the current Concept of Operations (CONOPs) calls for returning airdrop systems primarily via helicopter. Space on helicopters is at a premium due to the volume and weight of equipment and personnel that have to be transported. Since the JPADS 2K systems AGU is the more expensive and the smaller of the two components (wt and volume), the parafoil is often not recovered, or sustains significant damage from the cutting of suspension lines rendering it beyond economical repair. Second, if parafoils are not expeditiously recovered from the dropzone they can sustain damage from the extreme environmental conditions. Sunlight degrades the strength of the material and the wind can drag the parafoil through rough terrain that damages both the parafoil material and lines often beyond economical repair. An AGU can survive much longer in these environments and is therefore more readily re-used.  <BR>An expendable and hence lower cost parafoil for the JPADS 2K system would provide an airdrop capability beneficial to both the Air Force (high altitude delivery with horizontal offset) and the Army since the Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) would not need to recover and retrograde the parafoils back to riggers for re-use.  <BR><BR>It is recognized that with an expendable and less expensive parafoil the performance characteristics may diminish; however it is essential the parafoil still be capable of performing the mission requirements under the current JPADS 2K Concept of Operations (CONOPs). At a minimum, it should be capable of being deployed at altitudes of up to 18,000 ft MSL (Threshold) 24,500 ft AGL (Objective), of carrying between 1000  1850 lbs of suspended weight (T) 500  2200 lbs suspended (O), compatible with the JPADS 2K flight parameters found in the JPADS Mission Planner and landing at 28.5 fps (T) or less (O) with the cargo payload 85% mission capable (T) or greater (O). Deployment may be from fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft. It should deploy without damage and be capable of delivering the payload safely and in working condition. This parafoil is intended for use with cargo systems only and will not be used for personnel. The parafoil system should be delivered to the government pre-packed. A one time use parafoil that arrives pre-packed from the manufacturer will relieve receiving units in theater of the burden of parafoil packing in addition to recovery and repair. The parafoils should attach to an AGU and payload using established JPADS 2K rigging methods as much as possible and not require new training for riggers. It should also be compatible with the Armys existing JPADS 2K AGU configuration and Guidance, Navigation and Control software; having steering lines that can be controlled by the AGU and able to withstand the forces and wear/tear imposed by the AGUs motors. Interface specifications for the JPADS 2K parafoil and AGU are available from the technical point of contact below to responders who have or can demonstrate the ability to manufacture such systems/components. <BR><BR>The government is looking for the offerors to provide an estimate of the manufacturing costs and delivery schedule estimate of the proposed system in quantities of 10, 100 and 500 to include a delivery schedule for each quantity. Achievement of the cost and schedule goals can be attained by development or use of inexpensive textiles and innovative construction techniques that will produce a ram-air parachute capable of meeting the aforementioned performance requirements. Offerors need to be cognizant of the Berry Amendment, which precludes the Department of Defense from procuring textile or textile end products that are not produced or manufactured in the United States. Therefore, any parachute material or end product must be made in the United States. <BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. government. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited. We are seeking sources, technical and product information for products which meet the DoD requirements, or may meet requirements with modifications. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Please submit your responses by 7 May, 2010. Responses may be sent via email to Sanjay.patel2@us.army.mil or by regular mail to RDNS-WPA, Attn: Sanjay Patel, 15 Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5017.

<DESC>Reference No.: HHS-NIH-NLM-SBSS-10-105-KP
<p>Computational Thinking in Support of Clinicians and Biomedical Scientists<br /><br />RECOVERY. This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether there are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br /><br />Background<br />As part of its "Medical Advanced Research Projects Initiative," NLM wishes to evaluate the feasibility of using innovative computational approaches to enhance the ability of clinicians and biomedical scientists to solve one or more significant cognitive tasks and bring improvements in medical care to patients, families, and the public. <br /><br />Because of progressive advances in technology and computer science, computers can now perform exhaustive searches in many decision areas, in contrast to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in years past, devoted strongly to pruning decision trees. Accordingly, NLM believes powerful new partnerships between humans and computer may now be possible, and it is timely to re-access what are the most important computational challenges in bio-medicine.<br /><br />NLM intends to solicit feasibility or "proof of concept" studies that could serve as the basis for future longer-term, more extensive research projects. Innovative, "high-risk/high pay-off" proposals are the focus of this announcement; proposals bases on incremental improvements of existing systems will not be favorably reviewed.<br /><br />AI, a term coined in 1956, seemed to have limitless potential, including the development of thinking machines. Much was accomplished in knowledge representation, programming languages, and in development of expert systems that could do useful things in this or that domain. The latter, "partially intelligent artifacts", however, fell far short of duplicating the general intelligence of the human. Nevertheless, key challenges, for example, understanding of natural language in texts and speech, as well as a generation of innovative ideas and discovery, remain largely unresolved. Because few today believe that "strong AI" i.e. human-like cognition or better, is a likely near-term achievement, research and development largely gravitated to "weak" or "applied" AI, intended to produce "smart" tools, such as a security system capable of face recognition. <br /><br />To invigorate research in the arena of computation and cognition (and to avoid the increasingly diffuse connotations of the term "AI"), a number of fresh concepts, each focused on somewhat different aspects of the issues, have arisen in recent years: computational intelligence, machine learning, intelligence amplifying systems, flexible competence, human-computer collaboration, and computational thinking inter alia.<br /><br />For NLM, three factors have combined to rekindle interest in the potential of computation to carry out more ambitious cognitive tasks.<br />&bull; Continued advances in information technology and computer science<br />&bull; Increased awareness that "intelligent" behavior by computers requires substantial understanding of the operational decision space, and the more distantly related surrounding turf.<br />&bull; Redirection of goal from replacement of humans to enhancement of human intelligence by a human-machine partnership.</p>
<p>In biomedicine, clinicians and researchers now face formidable challenges in information management, innovation, and decision-making in an era which is seeing extraordinarily rapid growth of knowledge, distributed among a host of databases, and on a scale far larger than can be mastered by an individual. NLM believes that the remarkable speed, memory, and symbol-manipulating power of computers, if properly harnessed, can complement human cognitive strengths so as to enable efficient use of all of the knowledge relevant to solution of clinical and scientific problems.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />Clinicians, public health practitioners, and scientists (clinical and biological) face different professional challenges; the functions performed by a computational partner will depend on specific needs of each and on relevant domains of knowledge.<br /><br />Some areas in which computers could be of assistance include (among others):<br />&bull; Discovery science, including new methods for proposing creative hypotheses in clinical medicine and in biology, based on an interrogation of large, heterogeneous (experimental or computational) data sets. .<br />&bull; Language understanding of medical records, and of databases <br />&bull; Interpretation and intelligent summarization of data, text, or images<br />&bull; Decision support under uncertainty with associated explanations<br />&bull; "Intelligent" search and retrieval<br />&bull; "Reasoning" by analogy<br />&bull; Computer awareness of individual human needs, preferences<br />&bull; Computational analysis and modeling<br />&bull; Pattern recognition<br /><br />Following are examples of questions that are suitable starting points for investigation by those interested in Computational Thinking:<br />1. To what extent can the reasoning of new systems for Computational Thinking be made to answer to the need of humans to understand a decision or explanation?<br />2. In what ways can Computational Thinking programs explain and defend their recommendations?<br />3. Can a program for Computational Thinking recognize what it does not know? How? In what areas?<br />4. Are there areas of discourse in which understanding of Common Sense by the computer is necessary for useful function of programs for Computational Thinking? Are there areas in which Common Sense is not essential for useful thinking? Can we know the difference?<br />5. What is the size of the vocabulary needed for a Computational Thinking program to interact helpfully in a medical setting? What setting? What size?<br />6. Is there an area of Computational Thinking in which simple input will be helpful? What area? How simple?<br />7. Can a Computational Thinking program accept sophisticated processing of image data and then reason further to assist interpretation of the images, or management of the patient?</p>
<p>Can a Computational Thinking Program interpret the information on the current labels of a patient's current medications by expressing instructions to the patient, and, by accessing publicly available databases, bring back knowledge about the chemical structures, the actions of the individual drugs, the potential side effects, the likely interactions amongst the drugs, the availability of cheaper or better formulations? <br /><br />Required Tasks:<br />The contractor will be required to participate in the following tasks or prepare the following deliverables:<br />1. Attend contractor meetings (at NIH or some other mutually acceptable designated location). The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical research and development discussion. These meetings will be held quarterly.<br />2. Participate with the contractor team to meet the goals for this project. The expected level of participation includes regular attendance at teleconferences, video-conferences, or virtual conferences as scheduled by the Project Officer.<br />3. Obtain prior to submission of the offer an appropriate approval from an Institutional Review Board for research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46.<br />4. Ensure that any patient information to be included in the R&amp;D is appropriately anonymized.<br />5. Contribute documentation, tutorial materials, and courseware developed under the support of this contract.<br /><br />Reporting/Deliverables:<br />All principal investigators are required to attend quarterly progress meetings. Oral presentations and progress reports will be requested at those meetings, and electronic copies of slides, handouts, or documentation will serve as quarterly reports. Periodic teleconferences, video-conferences, or virtual conferences will be held to provide continuing communication among the project team. Attendance at these meetings is highly recommended. <br /><br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain.<br /><br />Deliverables will be reports to NLM that include:<br />Introduction<br />Methodology<br />Results<br />Discussion<br />Proposed Future Directions<br />Summary<br />References<br />Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is one year from date of award.<br /><br />Other Important Considerations:<br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract development services that will develop and test computational approaches to one or more cognitive problems as commonly encountered by clinician, clinical researcher, biologist, or patient. NLM places no constraint on approach. Artificial neural nets, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, statistical (e.g., Bayesian inference, regression, etc.) and other methods, alone or in combination are acceptable as are novel approaches. NLM expects that progress on each project will be an exploratory focus on feasibility testing; full scale development and formal testing are not requirements.<br /><br />Other issues to be addressed include relationship to project officer, meetings including a final all-hands presentation, requirements for submitting a proposal, review criteria, selection criteria, period of performance, sharing of all software, code, and documentation with NLM, etc.<br /><br />Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:<br />(a) Provide a capability statement that includes respondent's name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address and DUNS number. A brief description of comparable current and prior work, expertise, facilities, organizational structure, qualifications of key individuals (documenting expertise and field experience in the areas of interest) and any teaming arrangement needed to fulfill the requirement.<br />(b) Identification of any current negotiated GSA schedule, Government contract or commercial pricing rates; <br />(c ) Respondent's type of small business and business size (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.).<br />(d) Provide any other related information that the vendor may deem to be helpful to making determinations regarding this requirement.<br />(e) Respondents must ensure that their response is complete and and contains sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities, however, the capability statement shall not exceed 10 pages. <br /><br />All capability statements must be submitted in writing.

<DESC><p><br />SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT: <br />CLDP Conferences and Training Workshops</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research to determine the degree of interest and capability of U.S. Small Businesses&nbsp;possibly providing international logistical support services to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NAICS code for these services is 561920.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) is a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of State to help achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. CLDP usually provides technical assistance to designated countries by sponsoring technical skill training workshops, conferences, consultative tour visits, and short term law based programs domestically and overseas to include austere regions and areas of conflict. In order to carry out their mission, CLDP relies on the logistical capabilities of contractors to setup, coordinate, organize, and handle all the administrative event related tasks that go into putting on conferences, workshops, training seminars, programs, etc. for the CLDP at locations worldwide.</p>
<p>U.S. Small businesses responding to this Sources Sought announcement should have the organizational skills and logistical no how (comparable to what is listed below) to arrange for the following:</p>
<p>1) Participant travel, lodging and ground transportation to, from and during the events. Participants will be traveling from different locations throughout the world and ascending on one location where the conference (workshop, seminar or program) will take place. Contractors must be able to ensure travel arrangements are made and help each participant secure all necessary travel documents, visas, and passports so travelers arrive safely and promptly without interruption;</p>
<p>2) Contractors must be knowledgeable of the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) and be able to not only make travel and lodging arrangements but issue per diem allowances (based on FTR regulations) to participants and be experienced processing expense vouchers as necessary;</p>
<p>3) Vendors must be skilled at arranging for (i.e. seeking out, renting, leasing or just securing) conference space, breakout rooms and training sites and ensuring the proper setup and breakdown of these venues before, during and after an event;</p>
<p>4) Contractors must be able to coordinate the printing, collating, and distribution of documents, fliers, pamphlets, and booklets at the event (if necessary) and be able to seek out, secure, lease or rent conference equipment for speakers such as podiums, lecterns, overhead projectors, monitors, easels, microphones, speakers, etc.;</p>
<p>5) Businesses must provide translators and interpreters who speak and interpret different languages which are key to the success of CLDP conferences. Translators and Interpreters must be available (no matter where the event takes place in the world) to speak and interpret languages such as, to name a few, Bulgarian, Chinese, Spanish, Indonesian, Georgian, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Albanian, Urdu, Serbo-Croatian, Tagalog, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese, etc.;</p>
<p>6) Vendors must be able to make shipping arrangements domestically and overseas to ship such things as pamphlets, booklets and other event related materials to locations throughout the world. In some cases, securing advertisement space in newspapers and other mediums may be necessary for conferences and workshops;</p>
<p>7) Contractors must be able to seek out and secure venues and arrange for breaks and lunches at or in close proximity to the conference site;</p>
<p>8) Vendors must have the financial resources to provide logistical support upfront (travel tickets, passports, visa fees, hotel rooms, per diem allowances, ground transportation, rental and leasing fees, printing fees, etc.) before being reimbursed by the Government which be in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act. The costs for these conferences and their arrangements may run up to $500K and last five (5) days or longer (even months). Vendors must have the financial resources to provide logistical support for multiple projects at one time;</p>
<p>9) Contractors must ensure each event is properly coordinated and runs smoothly; thus, contractors may need to travel overseas or domestically to provide oversight;</p>
<p>10) Vendors must have excellent communication skills and be able to keep the Government apprised at all time of the status of the logistical arrangements for each event.</p>
<p>If you are a U.S. small business with experience, the logistical skills, and no how comparable to what is listed above and you are interested in being part of this market survey, please provide Kevin T. McGhee, kmcghee@doc.gov, at the U.S. Department of Commerce with a copy of your company's corporate capability statement addressing in detail the points listed above by Wednesday, April 14, 2010 by 12:00pm Eastern Time. In addition to those points above, please state the number of years your company has been planning events, list the type of events, whether these events took place domestically, overseas or both and the average number of attendees at the events.</p>

<SOLNBR>SNL--4-2-10--Branding
<RESPDATE>041510
<CONTACT>Martrice D Endres, Email mdendre@sandia.gov
<DESC>Background 
Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) has transitioned from being a pure Nuclear Weapons (NW) laboratory to a national security institution with NW accounting for approximately 50 percent of work, while Work for Others (WFO) has increased in importance. Sandia is a government-owned/contractor operated facility that employs approximately 10,000 employees and contractors with a $2.3 billion annual budget. Sandia is made up of world-class scientists and engineers who are unique national assets. Sandia embraces the broadened national security role. 

Statement of Work
Objective 
Sandia requires the development of a holistic and integrated brand refresh that encompasses all of Sandia’s diverse capabilities. Primary focus is on evaluating brand consistency and external brand presence across the Labs and its major functional areas, and creation of a refreshed presence that is comprehensive of the Labs current structure and focus. 

The primary target audience for this refresh will include regional, government, non-government, and national security laboratory complex. 

Scope 
The Contractor shall develop a branding strategy/program plan which will include costs of a prioritized implementation strategy and expected results. The branding strategy plan should identify and recognize the total of Sandia’s value, including products, services, people, positioning, and culture. The strategy plan should also include the effective use of websites, logos, symbols, and promotional literature to reach out and strengthen corporate community awareness of Sandia’s diverse capabilities. 

Mandatory Requirements
Demonstrated branding experience with major Fortune 500-type companies. 

Interest in the above may be sent to the Sandia Contracting Representative at mdendre@sandia.gov

Location: Crystal City, VA

Solicitation Number: DoD_2ndANNUAL_SOA_SYMPOSIUM_REGISTRATION
Notice Type: Special Notice 
Synopsis: The Department of Defense Deputy Chief Management Office is proud to announce the 2nd Annual Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Symposium: Government and Industry Best Practices on April 21 & 22, 2010.

About this Event: On April 21 & 22, 2010 at the Sheraton Hotel in Crystal City, VA, please join Elizabeth McGrath, ADCMO; David Wennergren, DCIO; Vivek Kundra, Federal CIO (Invited); Paul Strassmann, Former Dir. of Defense Information; and Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. as they impart the message of SOA and highlight the necessity of individual and team discipline in making SOA a successful reality. www.soasymposium.com 

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has embarked on a path to implement SOA as a primary means to deliver increased capability to the warfighter by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations. Industry around the world has demonstrated that SOA can substantially reduce the cost of IT infrastructure while greatly improving business agility. Both the IT and the business communities must jointly own and manage a proven inclusive architecture to achieve SOA success. 

In 2009, the DoD SOA Symposium demonstrated that SOA must be considered a Team Sport, involving all elements of people, process, technology, and especially Trust. This 2nd Annual DoD SOA Symposium is focused on the Discipline necessary within each individual team member and the team as a whole to be successful. Hear from Industry and Government experts on the following five tracks: 

Track 1: Service-Oriented Architecture & Solutions
This track is focused on the physical design of services and service-oriented solutions with an emphasis on exploring service-oriented technology architecture as a distinct form of distributed architecture. Also provided are sessions that address related considerations pertaining to the architectural impact of infrastructure, the creation of design specifications, the utilization of related technologies and practices, and how the emerging REST platform and related patterns and approaches can be leveraged in support of realizing service-orientation. 

Track 2: SOA Case Studies 
Real-life accounts of successful and failed SOA projects discussed first-hand by those that experienced the project lifecycles and have a story to tell. These veteran practitioners will provide advice and insights regarding challenges, pitfalls, proven practices, and general project information that demonstrates the intricacies of implementing and governing service-oriented solutions in the real world. 

Track 3: Semantic Services, Data Management & Analytics 
A series of diverse topics are represented by this track, including SOA and the semantic Web, semantic platforms for business intelligence, standards for data integration, SOA analytics and business intelligence, and performance and compliance management.

Track 4: Service Modeling, Service-Oriented Design & SOA Design Patterns
Fundamental phases in any SOA project are the analysis and design stages required to ensure that business and technology domains are being aligned as closely as possible throughout the service delivery process. This track contains sessions dedicated to service modeling and service-oriented design techniques, as well as the application of proven SOA design patterns. A focal point among these sessions is the exploration of SOA and business process modeling approaches, including the analysis and separation of business rules. 

Track 5: Governance & Security
This track covers the individual governance of services, as well as independent collections of services (or inventories), service portfolios, and the governance and long-term evolution of service-oriented ecosystems in general. Also encompassed by this track are topics that address service security and security mechanisms for service-oriented solutions.

Network with more than 500 Service Oriented Architecture leaders from across the U.S. Government and Industry.  The SOA Symposium will be held on April 21 and 22, 2010, at the Sheraton Crystal City in Arlington, VA, USA.

The study requires the contractors to conduct surveillance for influenza-like illness among their patients, evaluate persons with influenza-like illness for influenza, enroll and consent persons with influenza, and collect data and serial specimens from all participants. Because of the urgent need to be ready to implement this sub-study for the next influenza season, it is most effective and efficient to access the use of the longitudinal patient cohort studied (approximately 700 patients) under the research study entitled, "Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (The "SUN Study")." Furthermore, the SUN study sites have existing infrastructure to collect, store, transport, and analyze the specimens.

Specifically, the Contractors shall perform the following tasks in this project:
<p>Task 1.00: Performance of Specific Study-Related Activities <br />Subtask 1.01: Human Subjects Approval<br />Subtask 1.02: Conduct Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance and Evaluate Persons with (ILI) for Influenza<br />Subtask 1.03: Specimen Collection and Shipping<br />Subtask 1.04: Data Collection<br />Task 2.00: Software License for a Computerized Application for ILI Surveillance<br />Task 3.00: Site Investigator Teleconference Calls<br />Task 4.00: Laboratory Testing for Entire Study <br />Task 5.00: Monthly progress reports<br /><br />All presentations and publications from data analyses under the contracts may be restricted. All data generated under the contracts is the property of CDC.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Eugene O'Neill National Historic SiteReplace Old Barn FloorNaturalPAVE XL Resin Pavement Brand Name Product Use Justification

NaturalPAVE XL resin pavement is an environmentally friendly pavement system.  The NaturalPAVE XL is a water based binder emulsion that contains no petroleum binders, epoxy, chemical hardeners, or environmentally sensitive chemicals or substances that can leach into the soil.  NaturalPAVE XL resin pavement binder emulsion when combined with a pavement quality aggregate will produce a sustainable pavement surface that retains the natural coloration and texture of the aggregate.  It is cold applied, formulated with a non-ionic emulsifying agent, upon application to suitable pavement quality aggregates cures to a water insoluble binding and cementing agent of pavement mixtures suitable for vehicular and pedestrian traffic with high strength and sustainability.   Another resin pavement product such as Terra Pave contains a pine tree based binder emulsion similar to the old Road Oyl binder emulsion which has a terrible odor and has proven to be unsustainable.  This type of pine tree based binder emulsion product was previously used for the Old Barn floor surface, and the resin pavement surface failed rather quickly due to material spalling and degradation.  The park purchased the NaturalPAVE XL resin pavement binder emulsion and applied it to the failing Road Oyl resin pavement in the Old Barn to harden and stabilize the floor surface.  Other resin pavements contain epoxy, chemical hardeners and other environmentally sensitive chemicals and substances.  Other resin pavements do not equal the psi strength, stability, and sustainability that NaturalPAVE XL resin pavement provides, as well as other resin pavement manufacturers do not perform product testing such as the Marshall Stability Test and engineering performance test specifications that NaturalPAVE XL manufacturer performs to determine the material strength and stability.  
Soil Stabilization Products Company, Inc. is the manufacturer and has the patent on NaturalPAVE XL binder emulsion and does not sell it to other distributers.  NaturalPAVE XL resin pavement material has been used at several National Park sites including Fort Vancouver NHS, Golden Gate NRA, and John Muir NHS, as well as the Washington D.C.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award  modifications to its Medical Facility Architect and Engineering Services (MFAES) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order contracts(MATOC) which will increase the programmatic capacity.<BR><BR>The MFAES program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price task orders which are placed against the IDIQ contract in order to provide A-E support for criteria updates, studies, economic analysis and technical design support to DOD and non-DOD customers. The MFAES Program requirements are currently executed via Firm-Fixed Price Task Orders which are placed against four (8) ID/IQ Contracts (5 Unrestricted and 3 Restricted) in order to provide quick response to provide worldwide design and construction management expertise necessary to deliver the highest quality medical and medical research facilities to USACE customers.  All current contracts were made under full and open competition procedures.  The contracts were awarded in Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in July 2014. <BR><BR>The programmatic capacity established at the time of award for the current contracts was established at $249,000,000.00 ($234,000,000 for Unrestricted and $15,000,000 for Restricted) over a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established prior to the award of the contracts based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work and upon historical MFAES contracts/program data. Due to these increased effects, the MFAES capacity was prematurely expended.  As a result, it is necessary that the contracts be modified to allow for additional capacity to cover the ordering period.  Based upon future anticipated requirements, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contracts to increase the programmatic ceiling by $249,000,000.00 ($234,000,000 for Unrestricted and $15,000,000 for Restricted) which would result in a total programmatic ceiling of $498,000,000.00 ($468,000,000 for Unrestricted and $30,000,000 for Restricted).  The Government reserves the right to unilaterally modify the capacity of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities.  <BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:   W912DY-09-D-0068, Ellerbe Becket/RLF Joint Venture; W912D-09-D-0067, HDR Architecture; W912D-10-D-0002, HKS/Wingler & Sharp Joint Venture; W912D-09-D-0066,	Leo A. Daly; W912D-10-D-0001, Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects, LLP, W912D-10-D-0004, KAL Architects; W912D-10-D-0005, NIKA Technologies; and W912D-10-D-0006, WestEast Design Group.   The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.<BR><BR>The Government intends to award modifications and task orders to this contract consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy requirement. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result, given any other action due to current circumstances. Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for these services, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified. The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after the publication of this Notice of Intent will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this Notice of Intent is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length.  Statements and/or written inquiries may be directed to Calvin Fogle via email at Calvin.D.Fogle@usace.army.mil

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

The contractor shall render the services, provide thefacilities, and deliver all the supplies and services set forth herein.The following is a description of the existing non-commercially available neural networkwhich has already been developed. The system is a series of equations composed of 2000sets of data, each set includes 30 input parameters and 2 output parameters (wind speedand wind direction). The neural network attempts to represent these 2000 X 32 data pointsexactly by a series of equations. The contractor shall provide a performance and optimization analysis of the existingneural network which will include the following requirements and parameters:- Must be tolerant of high noise (mean and temporal S/N ratios less than 0.1).- Must be tolerant of sparse input data.- Capable of running in MATLAB in less than 0.001 seconds.- Must be able to produce predicted versus actual errors less than 0.5 kt speed and 0.5degree direction for every wind direction and every speed between 0 and 120 kts.(Performance better than these values should be optimized based on run time andaccuracy.)- The analysis should show with plots and text the advantages and disadvantages ofvariation in each parameter, as well as their sensitivity to variations in eachparameter.- The final report should include the neural net coeffecients and equations recommend forthe data set.- The analysis should show with plots and text the advantages and disadvantages ofvariation in each parameter, as well as their sensitivity to variations in eachparameter. The contractor shall also provide a deliverable which will consist of an accuracyanalysis, conducted for both baseline and potential optimized variants of a neural netalgorithm, using the reference truth dataset provided by the offeror, as well as afinal report of the analysis results which includes the neural net coeffecients andequations recommended for the data set.

1.  Background.   Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) is a national Indian community college operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  SIPI was founded in 1971 with the goal of providing post-secondary education opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives from federally recognized tribes from throughout the United States.  Instructional offerings include two-year transfer programs, one and two-year career and technical education programs, short course occupational programs, adult basic education, and a high school diploma program.  Classes are offered on the Albuquerque campus and at various tribal distance learning sites.  SIPI was designated a Land Grant Institution in 1994.  Land Grant status facilitates the development of food and agriculture science programs involving teaching, community outreach, and research.  SIPI's student body is comprised of American Indian students from across the country; students generally are 18 year-olds and older, although 17 year olds are sometimes admitted.  The average annual enrollment is 800-900 students with 100+ American Indian and Alaskan Native tribes represented.
In 2000, SIPI was granted a 10 year accreditation status (2000-2010) by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.  On December 9, 2009, SIPI completed a 10 year comprehensive site visit to reaffirm its accreditation status.  A team representing the HLC conducted the site evaluation.

Acquisition, Discovery, and Application of Knowledge-The organization promotes a life of learning for its faculty, administration, staff, and students by fostering and supporting inquiry, creativity, practice, and social responsibility in ways consistent with its mission.Criterion Five.

If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit cost or pricing data. All CLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for determination of reasonableness and affordability. Proposed schedule is provided (see Attachment 1) and is subject to change. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. Failure to provide prices as stated above may result in the rejection of the proposal. All cost or pricing information shall be addressed ONLY in the Cost/Price and Contract Documentation Proposal in Volume II. All dollar amounts provided in response to these instructions shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.</p>
<p>Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commerical Items:<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation and attached PWS utilizing Lowest Price Technical Acceptable Source Selection technique IAW FAR Part 15. Evaluation may be made with or without discussions with the offeror(s). The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a acceptable/unacceptable basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following two (2) factors:</p>
<p>Technical Capability and Price, when combined, are equal.</p>
<p>Factor 1, Technical Capability Evaluation: Acceptable /Unacceptable<br />Technically acceptability is defined as:<br />(a) Contractor has a sound technical approach that has the potential to meet all minimum qualifications stated in the PWS para 2.2.3 Performance Requirements and sub-paragraphs starting with 2.2.3.1 thru 2.2.3.8.<br />(b) Proposal demonstrates technologies used in the approach that are viable, procurable and producible. The Government may give further positive consideration for an approach that incorporates multiple source technologies.<br />(c) Proposal has an approach that allows the flexibility to incorporate new technologies without a major revamp of the requirement. <br />(d) Proposal has a sound risk mitigation approach for all identified technical risks. <br />(e) Submitted an acceptable Quality Control Plan (if required), <br />(f) Provides an effective approach to manage and minimize schedule and personnel disruptions.<br />(g) Provide any exceptions and assumptions with justification.</p>
<p>Technically unacceptability is determined by failure to meet the above technically acceptability requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 2, Cost/Price<br />The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total price based upon a comparison of the Offeror's price to the Independent Government Estimate. When two or more technically acceptable offers are received (competition) and the lowest price is selected, the price of the lowest offerer can be concluded to be fair and reasonable. A price that is very low will be verified to assure that the offeror understands what is being asked for and has made no errors.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and FAR 15.403-3 (a), information other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness or realism in the absence of competition. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit informal cost or pricing data.</p>
<p>Any exceptions to the solicitation's terms and conditions must be fully explained and justified.</p>

Answer 5: There are no international shipping fees associated with the Diplomatic Pouch.  Question 6: Is a common courier appropriate? Answer 6: In relationship to the delivery of the items to the Pouch address, yes.  Question 7: Are other medical supplies transported using the Registered Diplomatic Pouch system?  That would be a good model if Mark I Kits were transported that way. Answer 7: Yes, medical items are routinely sent via pouch to include medications, medical equipment, and medical supplies.   Question 8:  Should the shipping and handling fees be shown as a separate line item or included in the total cost? Answer 8: See Line Item 003 asking for one lot price.<BR><BR>

This solicitation is issued as Request for Quote (RFQ). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516. Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered. The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting the following services: Support Plan - MSPEC - LC - MS.

Statement of Work : 
Provide a one-year plus 4 Option Years comprehensive maintenance and service Support Plan for the TSQ Quantum Ultra System.  This instrumentation, its maintenance and uninterrupted operation and the collaborative interactions with vendor’s scientific and technical support personnel, application scientists and factory personnel is required and is a critical need for the regulation of food and drug products and agency’s food defense initiatives.

Most of the instruments in the labs operate around the clock to process samples that require a fast turn-around time due to numerous factors:  perishable import samples which need to be tested immediately so as to make a statutory regulatory decision on the admissibility of the product before it deteriorates at the port, consumer-complaint samples for which issues need to be resolved as soon as possible, and any analysis related to identifying public health outbreaks or analyses in support of product traceback are also high-priorities.  Due to the sensitive nature of the analyses the ORA field labs have to perform on a daily basis and instrument reliability and operational status is of utmost importance.  Instrument reliability can be achieved by appropriate service coverage administered by a professional company that can deliver comprehensive services and support in a fast, effective manner.

The service also requires support for technical inquiries within 2 hours.  This is another very important feature the labs routinely require.  For example, many minor software or hardware problems may have simple solutions that can be addressed with technical phone support, thus further reducing instrument down-time.  Also, whenever the ORA field labs are faced with a new challenge, a new analyte to screen for, they have to rapidly develop and implement new methods.  Availability of diverse scientific advice from the vendor’s technical support staff when trying to run new methods on the instruments is a required resource in this procurement as it directly assists in the speedy implementation of new LC-MS methods to respond to new challenges.  Most importantly, the service must afford access not only to application scientists and engineers, but also to the personnel at the factory with the engineers that designed and built the instrument.  This is a valuable resource for complex repairs and problems.

The service must also include at least one preventative maintenance visit per contract calendar year – maintenance visits prolong the life of the instruments, systematically replace consumable parts, and identify and resolve minor problems before they turn into big issues.  Having the routine maintenance performed by the professionals most familiar with the instruments frees up time of FDA lab personnel.  These visits also ensure that laboratories are in compliance with quality management system requirements. 

The service requires factory-certified replacement parts and software updates and notifications.  The contract must include a subscription to electronic support or Online Technical Resources which include notes developed by the vendor engineers and scientists and is a key advantage to having a vendor service contract in that FDA analysts have easy access to the authors of these notes.

This service will ensure reliable operation of the field instruments which in turn supports the mission-critical analytical work the ORA labs perform on an everyday basis to promote food safety and defense as well as to protect the Public Health.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

This includes correspondence explaining the requirement to obtain an independent evaluation of prior contract performance, and the Past Performance Questionnaire for use in evaluating Past Performance.  It is suggested you provide a pre-addressed stamp envelop to former clients for their use in submitting their Performance Questionnaire. See section Past Performance References for additional information. <BR>       Offerors are advised that the Government may use all data provided by the offeror in this quote and data obtained from other sources, to include but not limited to Governmentwide databases, in the development of performance assessments.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete Past Performance information rests with the offeror. <BR><BR>One award will be made to the qualified offeror deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to all the synopsis/solicitation requirements and is judged to represent the Best Value to the Government.  This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror; where the Contracting Officer determines that the Past Performance of the higher-priced offeror outweighs the cost difference.  To arrive at a Best Value decision this acquisition will utilize the FAR Part 13.106-2 evaluation of quotations or offers.<BR><BR>Past Performance Evaluation:  The past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offerors ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance record under existing and prior contracts over the past three years for similar services. The government will evaluate the offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet users needs, including cost and schedule. General trends in the Contractors performance will be considered. <BR>   The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of this synopsis/solicitation. Emphasis will be placed on recent, relevant experience. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained. A relevancy determination of the offerors present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors or teaming partners involvement) will be made. The Government is not bound by the offerors opinion of relevancy. <BR>   The Government may consider an offerors contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offerors present and past performance lend itself to this approach. For example, an offerors work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort. However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort. The following relevancy criteria apply: <BR>       VERY RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires. <BR>       RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       NOT RELEVANT: Did not involve any significant aspects of above. <BR>   In assessing present and past performance an overall confidence assessment rating will be made. The following performance confidence assessment ratings apply: <BR>Rating Definition <BR>High Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has high confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Significant Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has significant confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal Contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. <BR>Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). <BR>Little Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>No Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>   <BR>Price Evaluation:  The price quote shall initially be reviewed for compliance with the synopsis/solicitation. The Contracting Officer may complete the compliance review prior to the evaluation of Past Performance and offers that fail to meet the compliance requirements will not be evaluated and will be eliminated from the competition.  The purpose of the Price evaluation is to provide an assessment of the reasonableness and realism of the proposed price/cost in relation to the solicitation requirements. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner:  Reasonableness will be determined IAW FAR 13.106-3. <BR>   A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The Total Evaluated Price will be formulated as follows: <BR>       For CLIN 0001- CLIN 0015 the Contracting Officer shall add the total prices together to develop the TEP.<BR>       Offerors are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more schedule items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced. <BR><BR>FAR 52.212-3 (Alt 1), Offerors Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items (Offerors shall include a completed copy as part of their quote or a completed registration on the ORCA website (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx), 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders with the following clauses incorporated 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, 52.233-3 Protest after Award, 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim, 52.203-6 Alt.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 
(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

SUBSTITUTE SERVICES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The NAICS associated with this purchase is 443120, Computer and Software Stores, this procurement is unrestricted. Small businesses are being considered.
To be considered for award, vendors must be AUTHORIZED Moab, distributor or reseller. Vendors must quote ALL items to be considered for award. QUOTES MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation for consideration. Quotes must be emailed to NAVICP Code 0271.AG at amanda.goddard@navy.mil. All quotes are due by 9:00 AM Eastern, 13 April 2010. For further information regarding this RFQ, contact Amanda Goddard, Contract Specialist @ phone: (717) 605-1986.
The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors should provide "Remit To" address, if applicable; they are also reminded to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Jun 08) and 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Jun 05) with its offer.

Brand Name Posting information:FNMOC has used Moab on its systems for years.  It is approved in DADMS and assigned to FNMOC in MAAD.  To switch equivalent software would require finding an acceptable new software tool, gaining approval to use it, and re-training our personnel to use the new tool.  This is likely to be much more expensive than merely buying support service renewal for the already installed item.

<SUBJECT>USAC RFP for Case & Claims Management Software Solution
<SOLNBR>USAC-IT-2010-04-06
<RESPDATE>042310
<CONTACT>Jay H. Beard, Senior Manager Purchasing, Phone 202-776-0200, Fax 202-776-0080, Email jbeard@usac.org
<DESC>At the request of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Office of Managing Director (OMD), and to ensure wide exposure of the Universal Service Administrative Company's (USAC) solicitations, the FCC is alerting the public that USAC has posted on its website, the Request for Proposals (RFP) for a Case and Claims Management Software Solution. The RFP is available electronically at http://www.usac.org/about/tools/procurement. The closing date for proposals is April 23, 2010 at 5:00PM Eastern Time. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for program management services. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. No additional notification will be issued by the FCC. ALL COMMUNICATIONS IN REFERENCE TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE THROUGH USAC'S Contracting Office. The RFP describes the services requested and provides instructions on how to respond.

BACKGROUND: USAC is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation. The FCC has appointed USAC as the permanent administrator of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the universal service support mechanisms (Support Mechanisms): High Cost (HC), Low Income (LI), Rural Health Care (RHC) and Schools & Libraries (SL) as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As part of its administrative function, USAC performs, subject to FCC oversight, the billing, collection, and disbursement functions associated with the USF and the Support Mechanisms. Additional information concerning USAC and its administration of the USF and Support Mechanisms can be obtained from USAC's website located at: www.usac.org.

The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is requesting proposals for a Case and Claims Management software solution to support its IPIA Assessment Program (see RFP for more information on this program).  USAC is seeking a Contractor to: (1) propose a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Case and Claims management software product (Product) that can be configured to meet USAC’s requirements; (2) configure the Product to meet USAC’s requirements; (3) implement the Product in USAC’s environment so that it can be used to fulfill USAC’s requirements; and, (4) provide training and support for the configured Product.  While there are multiple business processes within USAC which ultimately may be able to use a single, standardized case and claims management software product, this procurement solely focuses on case and claims management related to the IPIA Assessment Program. The contract awarded shall be of a Firm Fixed Price (“FFP”).

THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT BY A FEDERAL AGENCY, GOVERNMENT CORPORATION, GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED CORPORATION OR OTHER ESTABLISHMENT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THE CONTRACT AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFP WILL NOT BE A SUBCONTRACT UNDER A FEDERAL PRIME CONTRACT TO USAC. 

Complete proposals must be submitted to Mr. Jay Beard, USAC Purchasing Manager, USAC Contracting Office, no later than the date and time set forth in the RFP. Proposals must be submitted by e-mail (rfp@usac.org), mail, courier or hand delivered to: Universal Service Administrative Company Attn: Mr. Jay Beard, 2000 L Street, NW, Suite 200.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman - Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman - Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JULY 2009)</p>
<p>Alternate I (Apr 2002) Offerors shall include a copy of this provision with their offer.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.(Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br />This is a best value, commercial item acquisition; award may be made for other than lowest price. The Government intends to award on an all or none basis to a responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provided the Government with the best value, price and other factors considered. Offers that are significantly higher or lower than the government's estimate may be evaluated as posing a significant performance risk. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS-  United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interest parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interest parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the vest interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protest must be filled within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904.  The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment one (1) is to posted questions and answers:

Questions for Solicitation NB866050-A-04269

CFD:
1.	Can NIST provide geometry (CAD) files for the respirator so that we can better assess the modeling details prior to submitting a proposal? If these are not available, can NIST provide a representative drawing and cross section of the respirator to be modeled? There are a variety of different styles available in the marketplace.
A.	The respirator to be modeled is an SCBA used by firefighters and other first responders.  Geometry files will be posted to the NIST ftp site by COB 6 April.
2.	Will NIST be able to supply the filter characteristics for the CFD analysis?
A.	This is an SCBA, so no filters are involved.
3.	Will opening and closing of valves (duration and amount) be defined a priori, or will these depend on the pressures/flowrates determined by the analysis?
A.	Valves will be opened and closed a priori for this study, with different boundary conditions for the inhalation and exhalation phases.
4.	What is the gas to be considered? Is it a single-phase, single species flow problem or is multiphase or multi-species analysis required? Are there any solid particles to be included?
A.	In this study only a single-phase, single species gas without particulates will be modeled.
5.	Are temperature effects to be included? Vapor condensation?
A.	No temperature effects or vapor condensation will be considered in this study.
6.	Are properties  (composition, temperature, etc.) of inhaled gas to be assumed identical to the properties of the exhaled gas?
A.	Yes.
7.	Is leakage a concern ? If it is, how is it defined ? 
A.	Leakage will not be considered in this study.

Structural:
1.	Will modeling of gross sliding of the mask over the face be required? In other words, is the mask slid over the face (e.g. from the forehead to the chin), or is it pushed onto the face and straps placed over the head to secure the respirator?  Simulation of the former is more challenging than the latter.
A.	It is anticipated that the mask will be pushed onto the face from a position directly in front of the face, in the same way that it would be donned by a real user.   Only the seal need be modelled, with rigid boundaries where the seal is attached to the facepiece.  In this study, the nosecup will be ignored and only the outer seal will be considered.  Because of the shapes of the seal and the face, sliding will be required in order to bring the seal into full contact with forehead, cheeks, and chin.

<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>(1) A copy of the company's business license(s), an HVAC certification, and a narrative summarizing the company's experience with similar work are required to be submitted with the proposal. The narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Certificates to be included with proposal. Also, one of the following documents are required: a Meisterbrief for electrical work and/or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>(2) The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. The handling fee will be applied to the estimated annual cost of parts and materials (approximately 6,000.00 Euro) and the result will be included in the price evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>--Business License(s): Business licenses submitted will be evaluated to determine if the contractor has authority to perform in Germany.</p>
<p>--Proof of enrollment or membership in a Chamber of Commerce or Chamber of Trade from any city or state in Germany (to be maintained for the duration of the contract).</p>
<p>--Contractor shall provide a certification to perform maintenance on HVAC systems (Zulassung als Kaeltefachbetrieb).</p>
<p>--A Meisterbrief for electrical work and/or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate (one or the other is required, but both can be submitted): Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>--A narrative summarizing company's experience with similar work. Narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Certificates to be provided with proposal. Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>(iii) By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>(iv) Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Support strategic and tactical management of Soldiers in a suite of global, networked, interactive, accurate military personnel systems performing Warfighter accountability, strength accounting, and personnel services.  Procure and field automation equipment to support field HR Operations.  On order, transition selected AHRS components to the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) or expand AHRS to cover Reserve Component forces.<BR> <BR>This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the IT support tasks required to support all aspects of the PDs to include Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and specialized information subsystems.  This combination of  LAN, WAN, and subsystems, including all network connectivity equipment, is collectively referred to as he network.  This support focuses on the functions performed by the PD offices in managing their respective programs, not on developing and fielding the applications that constitute the Programs themselves.  <BR> <BR>The contractor shall be responsible for the systems and equipment listed herein and in the attached documents, to include the analysis, design, implementation, testing, fielding, training, accountability and maintenance of these systems.  This includes all management of Federal Information Processing Systems (FIPS) life cycle support, e.g., the reporting, analysis, and computer support functions required to provide timely information to carry out the mission.<BR><BR>The PD Offices for RCAS and AHRS are currently co-located on the eighth floor of Hoffman II, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, Virginia.<BR><BR><BR>1.1	Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) Background<BR>The RCAS is an automated information system that provides the Army the capability to administer, manage, and mobilize Army Guard and Reserve forces more effectively.  Over fifty percent of the Army's force structure is in the Reserve Component. Existing information management systems in the Army National Guard (ARNG) and United States Army Reserve (USAR) are not integrated, are limited in capability and functionality, and require excessive time and manpower to operate and maintain.  The RCAS provides an integrated capability that supports mobilization and improves day-to-day administration and management of Reserve and Guard forces.  RCAS links approximately 10,500 Guard and Reserve units at approximately 4,000 sites located in all 50 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia.  The United States Army is sustaining the Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) to fulfill long-standing plans to improve the operational readiness of the Reserve Component (Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve) portion of the total force.  The RCAS supports the decision-making needs of all commanders, staffs, and functional managers responsible for Reserve Component forces. <BR> <BR>The RCAS provides state-of-the-art office automation, telecommunications, distributed databases, and distributed processing capabilities to provide timely and accurate information to plan, prepare, and execute mobilization and to improve the accomplishments of routine administrative tasks.  RCAS consists of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and office automation software, government off-the-shelf software, and custom developed software applications (where there is no existing application) integrated into an open system, PC based architecture.  The RCAS is a self-sufficient system, capable of exchanging data on a routine basis with related similar information systems in the Active and Reserve Components. <BR> <BR>1.2	Distributed Learning Project (DLP) Background<BR>The DLP is the technology component of the National Guard Bureaus distance learning initiative.  DLP provides community-based distributive learning classrooms increasing access to military training at the lowest possible cost.  The project is also demonstrating the significant value-added concept of sharing installed technology with the communities in which the National Guard is based.  The project complements the Total Army Distance Learning Program (TADLP) by providing additional classrooms and access in communities not currently addressed in the Army Distance Learning Plan. <BR><BR>DLP mission requirements are to improve readiness by providing greater access to military training and education; enhance command, control, communications, and computing (C4) within the National Guard; and to foster economic development, improve educational levels, and provide information access through shared use with the communities in which the Guard is based.<BR><BR>1.3	Army Human Resource System (AHRS) Background<BR>Product Director, Army Human Resource System (PD AHRS) provides tools to locate, manage, and serve the Soldier - anywhere in the world. AHRS is a human resource solution that supports strategic and tactical management of Soldiers to ensure Warfighter accountability and enhance personnel services. PD AHRS will transition selected functions to the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS) and will continue to develop and operate components that complement DIMHRS.   AHRS is a System of Systems comprised of the following:<BR>Deployed Theater Accountability System (DTAS) Enterprise and Theater Datastore<BR>DTAS is the first and only real-time web-enabled, connected and stand alone, SIPRNet application enabling deployed commanders to account for civilian/military personnel by name, SSN, unit, location, and day within a multi-theater operation.<BR>It interfaces with other Army and DoD systems to provide analytical information to the top-of-the system for future, present, and historical purposes. DTAS is currently fielded in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Qatar, and the Horn of Africa, providing real-time accountability to the Warfighter (currently all Army and Marine personnel) in those deployed theaters.<BR>Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO)<BR>eMILPO is a web-enabled application accessed via the Army Knowledge Online / Defense Knowledge Online (AKO/DKO) portal providing a reliable, timely, and efficient mechanism for performing personnel actions and strength accounting. Interfacing with 13 essential DoD and Army systems, eMILPO provides Human Capital management to the tactical, theater, and strategic level commander with Title 10 strength management functions in preparation for the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS), eMILPO Updates Total Army Personnel Database (TAPDB) within eight hours and standardizes personnel services and management for Active Component (AC) in garrison, all Soldiers on the battlefield and mobilized Reserve Component (RC), providing Multi-Component Unit (MCU) functionality to support Army operations.<BR>As the first step in the Army's Personnel Transformation, Army Knowledge Management (AKM) and DIMHRS-A, eMILPO consolidates the previous AHRS Super Server 43 PPAs database environment into one database, eMILPO's extreme ease of use, providing visibility of location, status, and skills of Soldiers both from a high level and a unit level, is vital in determining the strength and capability for Army commanders. The eMILPO subsystems, Enterprise Datastore (ED), and My Enlisted Record Brief (MyERB) are integral parts of EMILPO.<BR>ED replicates eMILPO, providing a timely and accurate custom reporting flexibility for commanders to enhance their personnel strength accounting analysis with much more detailed functionality pulling data from all AHRS developed applications. MyERB, fed by eMILPO, provides active enlisted Soldiers 24/7 access with a near real-time copy of their individual Enlisted Record Brief (ERB), and official HQDA photograph.<BR>Tactical Personnel System (TPS)<BR>The TPS is a stand-alone portable system providing accountability for all Soldiers. TPS creates manifest and jump manifest, personnel task forcing, crew status, and reports for tactical units. TPS interfaces with DTAS for mass Soldier upload at arrival in theater.<BR><BR>1.4      Purpose<BR>The purpose of this IT Support Services contract is to provide technical support and assistance to the PDs. It is understood by the PDs and by the contractor that automated data processing techniques mature and evolve rapidly and this PWS cannot be tied to a specific list of hardware and software.

It is anticipated that multiple five year IDIQ contracts will be awarded. Each item shall be proposed upon individually and shall be evaluated separately. Should an RFP be released, and an offeror desires to propose on more than one item, a separate proposal shall be submitted for each item. The USG may also issue split awards on a given requirement in an effort to foster future competition. Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially be qualified by being awarded an IDIQ contract and then compete for delivery orders as requirements arise. <BR><BR>Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience and capability, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts at a high rate of production. The Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts make up the shell bodies which are hollow cylindrical steel shells, topped by an open ogive-shaped nose, with a closed boattail at the rear of the projectile. The front end has a female thread that will be assembled with a lifting plug during transportation and handling. A metal rotating band encircles the projectile near the base end. There are two types of artillery shell bodies being procured; High Explosive (HE) and Smoke/Illuminating.<BR><BR>Production of Projectile Bodies requires a number of specialized processes and specialized equipment. Interested sources will need to have the capability to hot forge Projectile Bodies that are in excess of 20 inches long and have finished weights in excess of 70lb. This requires forging presses with capabilities in excess of 1,000 tons, and strokes commensurate with the Projectile Body length, as well heating capabilities to bring the forging mults to temperature. Some of the Bodies included in this sources sought utilize swaged Rotating Bands, while others have Rotating Bands that must be overlay welded in place. This overlay welding process requires highly specialized Rotating Band welding equipment. The majority of the Bodies produced under this effort will need to undergo a 100% Ultrasonic inspection, which requires highly specialized test equipment. <BR><BR>A TDP will be made available should a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) be released at a later date.<BR><BR>For purposes of this market survey, the following approximate quantities represent a high rate of monthly production for each item:<BR><BR>- Artillery 105mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M314A3  2,500 each<BR>o M927  5,000 each<BR>o PGU 45 HF  5,000 each<BR><BR>- Artillery 155mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M549A1  5,000 each<BR>o M825A1  6,000 each<BR><BR>Interested sources should supply the capacity for each product independently, and should describe where cross-product operations may be shared (Forge, Heat Treat, Machining, Pack-out, Paint, etc). This type of information provides the USG with the basic interdependencies between the product lines for planning purposes. A requirements matrix has not been prepared nor is there any timeline on when one may be prepared. The sources sought information is for planning purposes as this time. <BR><BR>The information submitted may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line. Contractors shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience as a manufacturer, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business.

<DESC>Please note: This project has been postponed to January 2011.  The Notification of Intent has been extended to 01 September 2010.  US firms that have already been nominated to the bidders list need not reapply.

<p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids for the proliferation of the Bi-Strategic Command Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS) Tasker Tracker Enterprise (TTE).</p>
<p>NC3A is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. NC3A has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on the basis of the lowest priced compliant bid (one envelope) procedure. <br /><br />The project budget scope has been estimated at Euro 1,270,000. The reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-12279-TTE. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>The IFB package, including the functional and technical performance specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, will be NATO Unclassified.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel visiting or working on operational NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of at least NATO Secret. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>The IFB will include the most recent (pre-industrialized) Taker Tracker prototype software, the System Requirements Specification for the industrialized version of the prototype, and the software documentation of the Document Handling System (DHS) upon which the TTE will be implemented. A bidders conference is envisaged during the month of May 2009 to present the project and provide any clarifications.</p>

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit proposals from sources to support the continued planning and implementation of the NCS. All services acquired through resulting awards will be considered part of the overarching NCS Coordinating Center (CC).   The NCS is a longitudinal cohort study that will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children enrolled from 105 distinct geographic areas across the country to form a nationally representative sample. Environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on children&rsquo;s health and development.  Priority outcomes include obesity, diabetes, and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; child development and mental health; and identifying beneficial health effects.  Children will be followed from before birth until the age of 21 years, via distributed data collection of a common core protocol. The CC is intended to support and assist in the design, development, implementation and evaluation of all Study components.  The CC shall coordinate and support the NCS Vanguard Study as a platform for feasibility testing of methods for possible inclusion in the main study.    The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990.

<AWARDEE>UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS CENTER FOR RESEARCH, INC. 2385 Irving Hill Road  Lawrence,KS  66045
<DESC>University of Kansas, Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) will provideNASA with a unique, custom built and designed cryospheric radar suite which includesthree radars necessary for mapping the bed topography of ice sheets, determining snowthickness on sea ice and monitoring the near surface firn layers on ice sheets. Theseradars are necessary to meet Operation IceBridge science objectives and is the only radarsuite that is adapted to fly on the NASA P-3 (a propeller airplane) and DC-8 (a jetairplane). This procurement action will require CReSIS to deploy, operate and maintaintheir custom built suite of three radars for the Operation Ice Bridge Greenland 2010aircraft campaign which will begin in March2010. The Greenland campaign is a series offlights designed to monitor the dynamic areas of the arctic sea ice and Greenland icesheet during the data gap between ICESat-1 andICESat-2, which will not launch until the2014 timeframe. The Cryosphere, including land ice and sea ice are essential areas tomonitor in a warming climate. This requirement also includes the processing of the radardata by CReSIS with their custom processing algorithms and the release of Level 1-B(geolocated radar echograms)data to the IceBridge Science Team three months after thecompletion of the campaign. CReSIS has already gathered data for Operation IceBridge inthe Antarctic 2009 Campaign. No other University or Company has the unique custom builtthree radar suite of instruments developed by CReSIS which includes the capabilities ofimaging fast flowing, rapidly changing glaciers, snow thickness on sea ice and nearsurface firn over the ice sheets. CReSIS has unique UHF (Ultrahigh-frequency)and VHF(Very high-frequency) airborne radars for imaging the near surface firn and snow depth onsea ice at a very high vertical resolution (5 cm). Because CReSIS has designed, developedand built these one of a kind instruments for cryospheric applications and adapted themto the NASA planes, they are the only qualified personnel to operate the instruments inthe field and are the only qualified personnel to repair the instruments.

<AWARDEE>The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York Mail Code 2205 1210Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY 10027
<DESC>Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University (LDEO) will provide NASAwith unique expertise in glaciological gravity data acquisition and interpretations ofglaciological gravity data over dynamic area of the ice sheets. Using the AIRgrav(Airborne Inertially reference Gravimeter) system, operated by Sander GeophysicsLaboratory (SGL), the drape flying that is necessary for the Ice Bridge campaign tosupport collection of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and radar measurements isachieved. This data is essential to understand ocean-ice interactions and the expectedfuture sea level rise from ice sheets. This action will require LDEO to coordinate withSGL, deploy and operate the AIRgrav system for the Operation Ice Bridge Greenland 2010aircraft campaign which will begin in March 2010. The Greenland campaign is a series offlights designed to monitor the dynamic areas of the arctic sea ice and Greenland icesheet during the data gap between ICESat-1 and ICESat-2, which will not launch until the2014 timeframe. The Cryosphere, including land ice and sea ice are essential areas tomonitor in a warming climate. The Greenland campaign will also measure the gravity fieldin order to estimate the thickness of the water layer beneath the floating ice tonguesthat are critical for the stability of ice sheets. This requirement also includes theprocessing of the gravity data by LDEO with their custom processing algorithms andrelease of data Level 2 (georeferenced gravity measurements) data to the Ice BridgeScience Team three months after the completion of the campaign.  The AIRGrav system isthe only gravimeter worldwide that can collect data in draped flight mode, where theaircraft follows the surface terrain providing the highest resolution gravity over shortwavelengths that are critical for the glaciological analysis done by LDEO.  LDEO is theonly university providing gravity data at the resolution needed to conduct glaciologicalstudies to determine the thickness of the water layer beneath floating ice tongues thatcannot be achieve with ice-penetrating radar systems. LDEO has already gathered data forOperation Ice Bridge in Antarctica during the Fall  2009 campaign. The AIRGrav system wascapable of imaging a sill beneath Pine Island Glacier that has been previously discoveredby a British AutoSub, yet had never been mapped fully until the use of the AIRGrav systemduring the Antarctica campaign.

<DESC>John D. Dingell VA Medical Center4646 John R StreetDetroit, Michigan 48201JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONBased on the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(2) under FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.Justification1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity   The John D. Dingell VA Medical Center Contract Office  at 4646 John R. Street, Detroit, MI 48201 requests approval of the following "Justification for other than full and open competition" to contract with Private Secretary, Inc. for a short term contract for medical transcription.2.	Nature/Description of Action     This document sets forth the justification and acceptance approval for one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-2(a)(2).  3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesMedical Transcription Services for Detroit VAMC.  The long-term contract has expired and the new contract solicitation for a consolidated VISN contract has not yet been issued.    The estimated cost for the six (6) month period is $60,000.00.4.	Identification of Statutory AuthorityThe statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(2).5.	Demonstration of Contractors Unique QualificationsPrivate Secretary, Inc. is the current transcription provider to the Detroit VAMC.    This is a significant factor in the decision to sole source.    A short-term contract on a sole source basis is need to provide that uninterrupted coverage/continuity of care until a new long-term contract can be competed and awarded.  Changing contractors twice in a six-month period would impact availability of information needed by physicians to make informed patient care decisions.     We anticipate the new contract will be in place within six (6) months using a competitive procurement process.6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure a Variety of Potential Sources      NA 7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost         The  line item cost has been determined by the using service to be fair and reasonable.8.	Description of Market Survey     	N/A9.	Any Other Supporting Data 	                N/A10.	Listing of Interested Sources  N/A11.	Actions That May be Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition   N/A12.	Contracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief./es/ Carole Soule			03/08/2010Contracting Officer			DateApproval/es/ Barbara Wilkinson		           03/08/2010	 				Date
