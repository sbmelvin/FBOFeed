<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Rochester Corporation, 751 Old Brandy Road, Culpepper, VA 22701 for the acquisition of five (5) Klein Winch Cables to support the Side Scan Sonar (SSS) System.   The Side Scan Sonar System is used to perform peacetime Q-route surveys.   The Klein 5400 Side Scan Sonar System is designed as a real time system in which seafloor imagery data is collected by the Tow Fish and electronically passed through the tow cable, through the winch slip ring and then to the operator console for processing.  Deployment, recovery, and normal streaming of the Tow Fish are performed by the winch assembly, tow block, and the ships stern crane.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Klein Side Scan Sonar was acquired as a commercial off-the-shelf capability for sea bottom characterization and environmental data collection capability for the!   MCM/MHC class ships under contract N61331-01-C-0022.   The winch cables that were provided with this system, were manufactured by Rochester Corporation.   Rochester Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the winch cables that are currently installed on MCM platforms.  As the OEM, only Rochester Corporation has the detailed knowledge of the SSS interface requirements, SSS design, and operation requirements that can provide the cable winch cables for the SSS system.  In summary, Rochester Corporation is the only known source capable of meeting this requirement.  NAICS Code:  335921 applies.  SBA Size Standard:  1,000.  FSC Code:  6015.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Hydroid, Inc., 6 Benjamin Nye Circle, Pocasset, MA for two (2) each, P/N 150367, Ultra Short Base Line (USBL) Receiver/Processors, and the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) to incorporate NSWC PC unique codes into the REMUS USBL Receiver/Processor.  This USBL Receiver/Processor will be incorporated into the current Hydroid transponder based Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) docking system.  The addition of this Receiver/Processor has the potential to greatly enhance the SDV’s underwater docking capabilities. Based on the preliminary engineering analysis, the cost (procurement and logistics support documentation revisions) to incorporate this additional Hydroid component into the existing Hydroid based system is significantly lower than the cost to perform a complete redesign and replacement of the SDV docking system.  These initial systems are being procured fo!  r field testing and evaluation of the actual improvements to the SDV docking system performance.  Evaluation of this system in its proposed application is expected to be completed within the next 6 months.  Equipment will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>*CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES -
                 CORRECT CODING INITIATIVE*

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) anticipates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract set aside for small business for the Correct Coding Initiative (CCI).  This fraud, waste and abuse contract will provide services to/for:
  •Maintain and further expand the current correct coding edits   to ensure proper coding for Medicare Part B and Hospital Outpatient services;
  •Maintenance of the associated manuals and of ongoing tasks, such as education to the provider community, replying to correspondence, etc.;
  •Continuous maintenance of the current CCI Comprehensive/Component and CCI Mutually Exclusive edit tables (procedure to procedure edits) and develop and provide continuous maintenance of Medically Unbelievable Edits;
  •Continuous maintenance of the CCI Coding Policy Manual, the CCI Correspondence Language manual; 
  •Maintenance of existing edits to identify inaccuracies, and any necessary corrections upon approval from CMS;
  •Establish and maintain databases to support deliverables related to quarterly replacements of the edits and to provide an audit trail pertaining to all decisions relating to the edits; and,
  •Establish and provide quarterly replacements compatible with CMS requirements for transmission of the data to the carriers’ claims processing systems and establish and provide an audit trail capable of responding to queries. 

The incumbent contractor will transition the current work to the new incoming contractor.  There will be an approximate two week transition period incorporated into the contract for this purpose.  In an attempt to improve the understanding of the CCI requirements, to allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and to increase efficiency in proposal preparation, CMS is releasing the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort with this announcement.  Attached is a copy of the Draft SOW CMS anticipates incorporating into the Request for Proposal (RFP).  

CMS anticipates an October 26th solicitation release for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with a two week transition period, a base year and four (4), one-year (1) option periods.  Again, this is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for which only Small Business Concerns will be eligible to participate.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Amy Duckworth, Contract Specialist, 410-786-3111, or via e-mail at Amy.Duckworth@cms.hhs.gov.  *PLEASE USE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS AND NOT THE ONE LISTED UNDER POINT OF CONTACT.*
E-mail communications should include company name, type of small business, address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  
THIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 
(1) The scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (2) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques; and (3) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.  

3.  The Government may use the services of JAG Technologies in an advisory role in the technical evaluation of white papers and/or proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm who review the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document. 

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement to upgrade two (2) UC-35C model aircraft to meet Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) mandates beginning December 2005.  NAVAIR intends to procure this effort from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Cessna Aircraft located in Wichita, Kansas.  The UC-35 aircraft is an FAA type-certified commercial cargo/passenger transport aircraft modified with Navy required items.  The Navy has procured two UC-35C and eleven UC-35D aircraft to-date from the OEM for the Marine Corps.  The proposed effort would capitalize on the proprietary engineering and manufacturing capabilities of Cessna, the OEM.  This procurement is to provide hardware, modification, system integration, installation, test and certification required to upgrade two UC-35C aircraft.  The Marine UC-35 is a relatively new aircraft, a derivative of the Cessna Citation V Ultra/Encore, and was first introduced in 1999.  Due to the UC-35’s short in-service history and limited deployment, Cessna is the only complete source of developmental, design, manufacturing, modification, and test certification data for the Navy’s UC-35 aircraft.  Cessna is the only source for OEM data and drawings to support this avionics upgrade to the two UC-35C aircraft.  No other source has access to the developmental information and engineering data and thus cannot provide the required support for the GATM modification and interface into the UC-35 cockpit avionics.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army intends to procure approximately 200 brackets, NSN 5855-01-172-1788 and the installation thereof using the infrared optical alignment procedures for the OR-336 180 element, detector cooler dewar assemblies, the heart of the Apache Forward  Looking Infrared System (FLIR).  This action will be a new work modification to contract W15P7T-04-C-L605 via sole source to DRS Technologies through the Canadian Commercial Corporation.  DRS Technologies maintains one of the only calibrated and operation al facilities that can perform the infrared optical alignment procedure.  This procedure requires familiarity with infrared detector cooler assemblies and the infrared/optical alignment of the assemblies for integration into the utilizing system.  If a con tractor has not performed this procedure within the last year, then they are not considered a qualified or proven producer and would be required to successfully complete first article testing requirements, which could take up to one year or longer.  The fi rst delivery of 40 bracket and alignment procedures will be 210 days after contract award, with the delivery of 40 bracket and alignment procedures each month thereafter until contract completion.  The Government does not own the complete technical data pa ckage to detail the manufacture of the item, testing of the item or the development of the required optical table and alignment procedures.  This will be a sole source modification authorized under FAR 6.302-1(a)(1) and 10USC2304(c)(1).  The point of conta ct for this action is Dennis Olson, 732-532-1130, E-mail address, dennis.olson1@us.army.mil.

Offerors may consider instructions contained in the AFRL BAA and PRDA Industry Guide, but if those instructions differ from this announcement, this announcement prevails.  The document may be viewed and downloaded at http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf.  

(3) Technical Proposal:  In the event that the White Paper results in an invitation to submit a formal proposal, Volume 1 -Technical Proposal shall include, as a minimum, a broad Statement of Objectives (SOO) or Statement of Work (SOW) for the basic IDIQ contract, suitable for incorporation into the basic contract; and a contract schedule.  Additionally, a SOW suitable for incorporation should be provided for Task 0001/Phase 1.  Volume 1 should fully address the approach in accomplishing the Program Requirements of Section A above.  The contractor must also provide a summary of relevant past and present performance.  Relevant past and present performance is defined as performance by the proposed program manager, lead technical investigator and/or chief engineer supporting ordnance package programs within the last five years, or past efforts by other key personnel proposed by the offeror for performance of this contract.  State the capacity in which these individuals acted in these relevant programs.  Relevant past and present performance data shall be submitted to the Government no less than 10 days prior to the specified proposal submission date.  In the technical proposal, the offeror shall propose and elaborate upon a specific Program Point of Departure Design.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2.  To that end, the proposal shall address all aspects of the Point of Departure Design.  The proposal shall also identify and discuss the suitability of the various modeling and analysis tools that the contractor proposes to use during the MR ROKM Program to accomplish the hardware design, and if and how existing modeling and analysis tools need to be modified.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion may be considered technically unresponsive to this BAA.  The technical proposal shall also include an overall test plan, with a supporting test matrix and discussion, which identifies all contractor and Government-conducted testing, as well as the facilities at which the testing is to occur.  To facilitate timely completion of pre-award surveys, offerors shall identify their own and subcontractor facilities and personnel, if any, to be involved in handling of explosives and other hazardous materials and the type and level of explosives/hazardous materials proposed.  In this proposal, the contractor must demonstrate knowledge of the systems engineering process and make realistic assumptions of how this kill mechanism could utilize data provided by the host missile, as well as how its functionality and effectiveness could be affected by missile control surfaces, cueing, etc.	

(4) Cost Proposal:  The Volume 2 cost proposal must include and segregate the contract costs, and also provide a total summary.  The contract costs shall include, as a minimum, a labor category and man-hour breakdown, by Phase and by task, including applicable labor rates, a cost element summary including labor, material, travel, other direct costs, overheads, G&A, etc., and reflecting all rates for the contract and data, and an expenditure schedule for the entire program.  The cost proposal shall include any proposed costs incurred by the kill mechanism manufacturer(s) in fulfilling their responsibilities to support manufacturing, assembly, and developmental testing of their kill mechanism. The offeror shall include estimates for the cost/value of any Government-Furnished Property (GFP), and all costs expected to be incurred by the Government associated with providing the equipment, facilities and support necessary to meet the contractor’s testing requirements.  Any costs associated with data or data rights shall be separately identified in the cost proposal.  

(5) Page Limitations:  White Papers are limited to 15 pages, which will include a ROM cost estimate.  Formal Proposal Volume 1 shall be limited to a total of 50 pages, including charts, figures, tables, etc. The proposed SOWs and resumes may be included as an appendix, and will not be counted in the page limitations.  The Government reserves the right to remove and return to the offeror any excess pages before the formal evaluation starts.  Cost proposal Volume 2 will have no page limitation; however, the offeror is requested to keep the cost proposal to 30 pages or less, if possible.  We request that the cost spreadsheets be submitted in Microsoft Excel format.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 12-pitch, with line spacing of not less than one and one-half for the typeface used (no more than 34 lines per page) for formal proposals.  White Papers may be single-spaced.  Proposals shall be submitted as an original document and five paper copies, and one copy of both the Technical and Cost Proposals should be submitted on CD or DVD.   Note:  Submittal of a proposal constitutes contract

<DESC>This is modification 03 to the STRIFE Amendment to MNK-BAA-04-0001, Armament Technology Research.  [Modifications 01 and 02 extended the deadline for receipt of proposals to 19 Jan 04, and then again to noon, 20 Jan 04]  This modification further modifies the STRIFE Amendment to add that the Government will also send by FedEx to those contractors who properly request the supplemental data, a general cost for conducting cannon tests at Eglin AFB.  This modification also further modifies the STRIFE Amendment to make the following clarifications.  (1)  Section C, paragraph (1):  In reference to the AFRL BAA and PRDA Industry Guide recommended in this paragraph, please note that, as the Guide states, where it differs from the BAA (i.e., STRIFE Amendment), the BAA should be followed.  The Guide is just that--a guide, and is not law or statute.  (2)  Section C, paragraphs (2) and (4):   The definition of Past and Present Performance should be broadened to include relevant product/program information as well as the other information stated in the BAA.  Although Past and Present Performance information may properly be included or alluded to in the Technical Proposal, and its page count, a list of pertinent contracts, experience, points of contact, phone numbers, etc., and any resumes, should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the 50-page count of the Technical Proposal.  The Appendix should be delivered to Trisha Brinton or Carol Abbott not later than close of business, 6 Jan 04.  Section C, paragraph (4) is also modified to require, in addition to One original and 5 paper copies, one copy of both the Technical and Cost Proposals on disk or CD.  


sm for the Joint Dual Role Air Dominance Missile (JDRADM) and possibly other air-launched weapon platforms.  The overall goal of this program is to produce a realistic, transitionable design that provides appropriate consideration of risk.  The contractor shall provide all items necessary (e.g., personnel, facilities, equipment, documentation, and expertise) to convey their ability to successfully plan, organize, execute, and manage this program.  The program consists of, but may not be limited to, the following major tasks:  

(a) Design:  The contractor shall design a kill mechanism that meets or exceeds the technical requirements. The contractor shall identify all materials to be used in the design.  The safety aspects of the design shall be agreed upon by the contractor and the Government to increase the likelihood that the Air Force and Navy safety communities will approve the final design.  

(b) Analysis:  The contractor shall conduct tests as necessary to predict/validate:
 
(i)  Penetration of the casing fragments/projectiles; 
(ii)  Ability to direct a lethal density of fragments/projectiles about an aim point;
(iii)  Secondary kill mechanisms beyond penetration;
(iv)  Utilization of Insensitive High Explosive (IHE) if design preserves desired projectile flight and impact velocities; and
(v)  Relative effects of dynamics on the performance of items (i) and (ii), relative to warhead effectiveness. 

(c) Test Planning: The contractor shall develop and provide a test plan and the test schedule necessary to achieve the program objectives.  The contractor’s technical proposal and cost estimates shall include all support costs for Government-provided test support and facilities, if they are required.  The Government does not envision providing test facilities and/or equipment to support this effort.  The test plan should achieve the program threshold and objective requirements, while providing the maximum amount of information with respect to the lethal effects of the MR ROKM design, including but not limited to fragment density on target, fragment penetration, fragment velocities, and heat and pressure generation and distributions. The test plan proposal may include a combination of scaled and/or full scale testing and environmental and/or laboratory evaluation tests, but must be within the program budget (specified in section B (4) of this document) and period of performance.  The contractor shall identify all data collection requirements, instrumentation and/or methodologies necessary to evaluate the performance of each proposed test event.  The contractor’s test plan shall be submitted to the Government for review and approval.  The Government will have 7 working days to review and make comments to the test plan.  The contractor shall plan to conduct design reviews appropriate to the stage of development with or without Government participation, and test readiness reviews as necessary.  

(d) Fabrication and Hardware Delivery:  Test articles shall be built and delivered to the testing site according to the proposed test schedule.  The method of transporting, number and type of inert and live test articles, and location to which they are to be delivered, should be explained.  The contractor shall fabricate a sufficient number of test articles to accomplish all tests identified in the test plan, plus provide two (2) fully functional, complete test items for Government evaluation. 
 
(e) Testing:  The contractor is responsible for all testing associated with this program.  The contractor-generated test plan(s), as approved by the Government, shall become schedule milestones.  For all tests, the contractor shall provide test support to include the following:

•	support test planning meetings; 
•	oversee/conduct test article manufacturing and assembly, checkout, and upload of hardware; 
•	identify risk or potential problems and suggest improvements; 
•	record test setup;

•	collect data needed for evaluation of the ordnance package; document test results; 
•	explain use of test data to influence future iterations in a spiral design process.  

(f) Safety Reviews:  The contractor shall support all Government safety reviews, including, but not limited to, documentation and manpower.  

(g) Final Report:  At the end of each task, the contractor shall present all work performed on the MR ROKM contract in a technical report format. The final technical report shall be releasable to DoD and US DoD contractors only.  The final report must be in sufficient detail to serve as a stand-alone document addressing the concept and technology evaluated, and the performance demonstrated.  The final report shall include background information, design documentation and the evolution of the design, critical trade studies and analyses that have influenced design and analysis decisions, any special fabrication instructions/ notes, a summary of test events, test predictions, test results, post-test analysis and conclusions, an evaluation of tools used, assumptions regarding modeling and simulation, explanation of tool modification, evaluation of necessary actions to bring the kill mechanism to IM compliance, and rough cost estimate of the final design.  In addition, risks of all major program elements (cost, schedule, technical) should be examined, including a summary of the diminishment of risks over the course of the program, addition/closure of risks, and which risks would persist post-program.  Finally, include recommendations of the way forward for the technology, including what steps would be necessary to ensure ability to transition and a unit cost estimate for the current design.   

(h) Management:  The contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of this contract, including but not limited to, cost, technical, schedule, and security.  The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through Data Requirements submissions discussed in Paragraph A(7) and scheduled meetings discussed in Paragraph A(8).  The contractor shall provide technical risk assessment, program schedule and cost of contract.  In addition to formal design reviews, informal program status interchanges (such as weekly teleconferences) are encouraged.  The contractor shall provide technical risk assessment, program schedule and cost of contract.  

(i)  Safety:  The contractor shall have an operational risk management (ORM) plan in place for all aspects of manufacturing, assembly, setup, execution, and break down of the kill mechanism testing.  Approval of this plan by the Government is required before testing occurs.  

(5) Design Requirements:  The contractor is responsible for providing the detailed design of the MR ROKM kill mechanism.  Design aspects included (but not limited to) are:  assessments of lethality for each target of interest, lethality assessment source and executable software developed under this contract and corresponding results, hardware drawings, and detailed test data generated as a result of testing under this contract.  Updates shall be provided to the Government in a timely manner.  

(6) Environmental Protection Requirements:  During the design, assembly, and test effort, the contractor shall evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with the fabrication and testing of the proposed kill mechanism design.  Pursuant to Federal statutes, the contractor shall minimize the use/selection of hazardous materials and processes utilizing hazardous material to avoid or minimize generation of hazardous wastes as identified in 40 CFR 261.  The contractor shall notify AFRL/MNMI of what hazardous materials are utilized during the contract, or would be required for the technology being developed.

<DESC>MR ROKM PART 2 - Multi Role Responsive Ordnance Kill Mechanism (MR ROKM) Program

Special Amendment to MNK-BAA-04-0001 Continuation

B--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1) Type of Contract: The Government anticipates negotiating approximately two Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts for this effort.  Task Order 0001 will be issued along with each contract awarded, for Phase 1 (the first 11 months) of the program.  At the end of Phase 1, a down-select to a single contractor will occur, and program Phase 2 will be awarded under Task Order 0002 to the selected contractor.  A third Task Order for Phase 3 is anticipated upon completion of Phase 2/Task 0002.  It is currently expected that the MR ROKM Program will consist primarily of Task Orders 0001, 0002, and 0003.  However, an IDIQ contract will allow for additional in-scope tasks to be awarded later to accommodate spiral developments and additional funding should it become available.  Accordingly, it is anticipated the IDIQ contract will bear a ceiling maximum of approximately $14M.

(2) Expected Award Date:  Late September 2005.

(3) Anticipated Period of Performance:  The IDIQ MR ROKM program contract ordering period will be 5 years.  The current MR ROKM program is anticipated to take 48 months, with Task 0001/Phase 1, taking approximately 11 months, Task 0002/Phase 2 taking 2 years, and Task 0003/Phase 3 taking 1 year.  The 5-year ordering period will allow for the addition of in-scope tasks and spiral developments should additional funding become available.

(4) Government Funding: The Government is currently considering the following funding profile for this effort:  $10K in FY05 funds per contractor; $1,130K in FY06 funds per contractor; $2,280K in FY07 funds for a single contractor; $3,162K in FY08 funds for a single contractor; and $1,013K in FY09 funds for a single contractor for the remainder of the MR ROKM program.  This is an estimate only--not a promise of funding.  It is desired that contract expenditures be managed and billed so as to maximize FY05, FY06, FY07, FY08, and FY09 expenditures.

(5) Government Furnished Information (GFI):  The Government may assist in providing GFI, based on availability, if requested.  Therefore, the offeror shall include a detailed list of Government resources (material formulation instructions, lethality assessment software, target models, etc.), and their associated approximate costs, required to execute a contract in a timely and cost effective manner.  

(6) NAICS Size Status.  NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710; small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The acquisition is unrestricted (considered full and open competition).  Thus, all qualifying responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered (but see next paragraph).

(7) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms:  A determination has been made for this solicitation, that all foreign participation at the prime contractor and subcontractor level will be prohibited.  

(8) Cost-Sharing Proposals: The Government does not require a cost sharing arrangement.  If one is proposed, the Government may or may not consider such an arrangement for award.  

(9) Down-Selections:  Selections for subsequent tasks will be based on the contractor’s ability to achieve and exceed the technical program requirements/goals of Phase I, as defined below.  Additionally, a refined proposal will be required at the end of Phase I, which will be evaluated against the Evaluation Criteria Factors in Section D--Basis for Award.

 (10)  Scheduling and program planning.  The entire MR ROKM Program consists of multiple “Phases”.  It is currently envisioned that the plan for MR ROKM is as follows:

Phase 1 (September 2005 – August 2006):  Dual award.  Design, fabricate, and perform a static arena test of the MR ROKM kill mechanism, explosively launching projectiles vs. target panels (to simulate the MR ROKM air and ground targ

(9) Evaluation Criteria:  MNK-BAA-04-0001, Part II PROPOSAL EVALUATION, is amended to reflect the following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance for each:
(a) Proposal Evaluation Criteria: 
1.  Technical Merit: Overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission, and extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing the overall research program of this directorate.  This includes the following four sub-factors (listed in descending order of importance):
a.  Soundness of proposed approach to;
1) Meet performance objectives (e.g. range of impact angles, accuracy, penetration capability and survivability, footprint, etc.), 
2) Integrate with aircraft (B-2/B-52),
b.  Technical feasibility (to include risk assessment) of proposed MOP point of departure design and the concept of operation;
c.  Scope of the proposed approach in addressing critical technical issues through the appropriate mix of analysis, modeling and simulation, critical component fabrication, as well as component and wind tunnel testing;
d.  Soundness of offeror’s process to develop a system design, test plans, system specifications, and the final technical report.
2.  Relevant Past and Present Performance:  Offeror’s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives.  Past performance will be based on work similar in scope (e.g. knowledge of penetrators, GN&C, etc.) and performed during the last 5 years.
3.  Key Personnel:  Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  Cost:  Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.
5.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB) Participation:  Pursuant to FAR 19.12 all proposals will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis as to the extent of participation of SDB.  Offerors will provide targets for SDB participation, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in the SIC Major Groups as applicable, as well as total target for SDB participation as joint venture partners, team members, or subcontractors.  Failure to submit these targets will render the offeror ineligible for award.  These targets will be incorporated into and become a part of the contract.  
Offerors are reminded that this requirement is different from and in addition to the requirement for submission of a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1) & (2).

<DESC>MR ROKM PART 1 - Multi Role Responsive Ordnance Kill Mechanism (MR ROKM) Program

Special Amendment to MNK-BAA-04-0001

INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNM) is interested in receiving White Papers for the MR ROKM Program under this Special Amendment to Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-04-0001, for Armament Technology Research.  AFRL/MN has been investigating directional warhead technologies for the past 8 years, culminating with the PIOS Phase II Program.  The PIOS II program goals were to use novel geometry and initiation schemes to maximize the lethal effects of fragments aimed toward a point on an air target, and to increase the counter air lethality at increased miss distances.  As an evolution of these technologies, AFRL/MNM now seeks the design of a kill mechanism with a dual role capability that would address a subset of stationary ground targets in addition to air targets.  This kill mechanism is intended for use in a new dual role missile system.  The focus of the MR ROKM Program is to maintain current counter air missile lethality while demonstrating effectiveness against stationary ground targets.  

White Paper submittals should reference “MNK-BAA-04-0001” and the Research Topic “Damage Mechanisms Research”.  Where the instructions in MNK-BAA-04-0001 differ from the instructions in this Special Amendment, this document prevails.  White Papers should not exceed 15 letter-size pages, with not less than 12-pitch type size, and should be submitted not later than 1:30 PM Central Time to AFRL/MNK on 05 July 05.  It is anticipated approximately two of the White Papers may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating approximately two contracts for the MR ROKM Program.  Four hard copies and one electronic copy (on a CD or DVD) of the White Papers should be submitted to the AFRL/MNK Contracting office to the parties shown in Section E - item (1).  Email submissions will not be accepted.  A confirmation of receipt will be generated via email as White Papers are received, if an email address is provided with the White Paper.  All submittals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Evaluation Criteria found within this document.  Offerors should be alert to any amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend due dates or other data as necessary.  


A--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1) Program Objective:  The overall program objective is to design and demonstrate a multi-role kill mechanism that would defeat air targets and a subset of stationary ground targets.   

(2) Technical Requirements and Goals:  The contractor’s design shall be based on the program objective and the requirements/goals.  The contractor’s design shall, as a minimum, satisfy the technical threshold requirements and strive to meet the technical objective requirements.

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is interested in receiving proposals for the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) program.  The proposals will be accepted under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number MNK-BAA-04-0001; Armament Technology Research; topic entitled Flight Vehicles Integration Research.  Proposal submittal deadline for the past performance volume is 4:00 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT), 2  Aug 04 and submittal deadline for the technical and price/cost is 4:00 PM CDT, 16 Aug 04. Submit 3 hard copies and 1 CD of all volumes to include past performance, technical and price/cost to AFRL/MNK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Ste 337, Eglin AFB, FL  32542-6810.   A confirmation of receipt will be generated   when proposals are received.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to ensure that confirmation of receipt is obtained by the proposal submittal deadline.  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), Instructions of Offerors – Competitive Acquisition.  All proposals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Proposal Evaluation Criteria found within this document.
Background:
This effort builds on the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Phase I program.  The objective of this phase was to perform a risk reduction effort for a large penetrating munition and to conduct a study to assess the potential for integration in the B-2/B-52 aircraft.  The large penetrating weapon is being designed for the defeat of a specialized set of hard and deeply buried targets. 
The tasks of the first phase were to evaluate a case design, investigate explosive manufacturing concepts, refine and evaluate the control actuator system and define the guidance kit packaging.  Trade studies were conducted on the aerodynamic configuration; fuze; guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C); guidance kit packaging; accuracy; and flight demonstration options.  Performance predictions against targets were analyzed and a carriage and release concept was developed.
Program Objective:
The goal of the MOP program is to design and test a large penetrating munition, to demonstrate the weapon’s lethality against multi-story buildings with hardened bunkers and tunnel facilities and to reduce technology risk for future development.   
Technical Requirements:
The MOP design will include the capability to defeat hard and deeply buried targets.  It will be carried internally in a USAF B-2A/B-52 bomber and employed at high altitudes.   The munition will attack targets at target altitudes of up to 10,000 ft.  The munition will not exceed 30,000 lbs and will maximize explosive fill while maintaining structural integrity throughout the penetration event.  The munition will be guided and have capability in GPS disrupted environments.  
The main tasks for this program are laid out below.  The program will be structured as a concept refinement task order (TO) with additional task orders for each of the remaining tasks.  It is envisioned that one contract will be awarded.  
TO 1 – Concept Refinement:  TO 1 shall be performed upon receipt of Government authorization to proceed/contract award.  The contractor shall perform a cost /performance analysis (of proposed MOP designs – including platform integration options), a penetrator optimization study, technology investment plan, and propose a Preliminary Design (PD).  The contractoor’s authorization for limited reproduction and dissemination within Government agencies and National Laboratories for evaluation purposes only, as stated in FAR 52.215-1(e).  

(6) Preparation Costs:  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government.  The US Air Force reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts based on the proposals received.  

(7) Data Rights:  The Government is anticipating unlimited data rights to all data generated under this contract, to include drawings and results.  The contractor is instructed to address data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc., in the proposal.

D--Basis for Award:

Evaluation Criteria:  White Papers and proposals will be evaluated as received, in accordance with their projected success in achieving the requirements and goals outlined in Section A—REQUIREMENTS, of this Amendment, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below.  Additionally, a risk assessment will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government.

<DESC>The correct Point of Contact (POC) for this procurement is Ayo H. Kimathi @ (202) 336-8560, akima@opic.com. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an agency of the U.S. Government, requires a contractor with proven international experience to provide all conference planning, recruitment, promotion, logistics and business advisory services for one international business and investment conference focused on the housing sector to be held in sub-Saharan Africa. An investment conference is defined by OPIC as a conference in which participants are interested in investing (i.e. establishing an on-ground business presence in the region) versus simply looking to export products for sale in the region.

It is anticipated that the conference will take place in the spring of 2006 (Mid-March to late-April) and will probably occur between a Tuesday and Thursday, depending upon availability.  This is one of the things the contractor will assist in determining.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add the following background information to the Funding Opportunity Description.  No other changes have been made.

Much of the current research in the area of net-centric approaches aimed at addressing the technical challenges presented by System of Systems (SOS) and information interoperability is primarily focused in the area of Business to Business (B2B) exchange of services, information and/or products.  Standards organizations such as the WC3 (www.w3.org) and OASIS (www.oasis-open.org) are engaged in the development of XML-based specifications that define the protocols and information exchange formats that establish the foundation for building business capabilities and their underlying commercial Web Services (WS) infrastructure implementations.  The DoD is basing their Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG-ES) (www.disa.mil) and Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) (www.disa.mil) infrastructure on these emerging standards.  It is expected that NCES will provide the core services that will enable the interoperability of all DoD net-centric operations from business processes to the forward deployed warfighter. 

Concurrently, AFRL/IF has been conducting research in the areas of information dissemination and management approaches which have been focused primarily on military applications and requirements.  This research has lead to the development of multiple information dissemination and management infrastructures conforming to the Infospherics (www.infospherics.org) Common API.   Both commercial and AFRL/IF research and development initiatives provide useful approaches to systems and information interoperability challenges. The concept of a Community of Interest (COI, www.dod.mil/nii/org/cio/doc/COI_FAQ.doc) Infospace i.e., an infospace consisting of multiple information systems that interoperate to address a set of mission and information requirements, provides a useful basis for interoperability regardless of underlying technology or implementation. Understanding how these concepts and technologies can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains is of critical importance.  Further, identifying and addressing deficiencies in these technologies will be essential to achieving the DoD vision of Net-Centric Operations (NCO).

2040 Broadway Street, Quantico VA 22134.  The MC2I Radar Program Office will present a Project and Future Directions Brief to all interested parties.  Specifically, the Project Office will present the planned development and delivery strategy for the Highly Expeditionary Long Range Air Surveillance Radar (HELRASR) Program, the Long Range Radar Antenna Array Engineering Development Model (EDM), an AN/TPS-59(V)3 shelter redesign effort to address and mitigate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, and the Radar Environmental Simulator (RES) effort.  The HELRASR is the next generation radar to replace the currently fielded AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar system.

Interested vendors are encouraged to have cost estimators in attendance as anticipated future discussion may require fiscal experience.  Vendors may request a one-hour one-on-one session after the initial one-hour briefing period.  Please reply to Lisa Herbst, (540) 657-5871, email lherbst@anteon.com no later than 7 November 2005 with your list of attendees and to arrange individual meeting times.  Secondary POC is Mr. Bob Van Olst, 703-432-4252, email robert.vanolst@usmc.mil.  All briefs are unclassified, however clearance information must be provided to gain access to the facility.


Maximum use of advanced technology in radar development and design is highly encouraged to produce a complete system to meet or exceed the mobility and transportability requirements outlined in the draft CDD and draft Performance Specifications while maintaining and improving the performance of the Marine Corps’ next generation long range radar system.  The new radar must be built within the funding constraints outlined in the current profile for HELRASR.  This funding is an estimate only and is subject to change.

Supportability considerations should be addressed in the design and development of the new radar, to include complete support for sustainment throughout the life of the system.  Critical to supporting the system is an effective maintenance and support philosophy.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and maintenance concepts designed to reduce life cycle cost to the Marine Corps should be addressed and included in the overall design of the system.  Autonomic logistics are essential for complete electronic and mechanical monitoring of the system and is critical to assessing system health.  Supportability considerations should also address seabased logistics and integrated data environment capabilities.

Contractors are invited to read (only) the current drafts for the 3-DELRR Concept Development Document (CDD) and Performance Specification at Anteon Corporation, Stafford Operations Center, 16 Center Street, Stafford VA 22556 by coordinating a visit request in advance with Lisa Herbst at (540) 288-5475.

Important Note on Foreign Content
The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as “The Berry Amendment” impose restrictions on the DoD’s acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and “specialty metals” (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

The Government anticipates that the number of most highly-rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range will exceed the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.  The Contracting Officer may conduct the technical evaluation using a two-phase process pursuant to provision 52.215-9PC1, as contained in the Addendum to provision 52.212-2, Additional Source Selection Evaluation Procedures (applicable to Commercial Item Acquisitions only) or Section M (applicable to other than Commercial Item Acquisitions only).  During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated.  Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors.

The Contract Specialist is Tracey O’Donnell.  She can be reached at (215) 737-7236, Email, tracey.odonnnell@dla.mil. Patterns and specifications can be ordered on www.warfighter.net under the contracting page.

Important Note on Foreign Content
The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as “The Berry Amendment” impose restrictions on the DoD’s acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and “specialty metals” (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

The Government anticipates that the number of most highly-rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range will exceed the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.  The Contracting Officer may conduct the technical evaluation using a two-phase process pursuant to provision 52.215-9PC1, as contained in the Addendum to provision 52.212-2, Additional Source Selection Evaluation Procedures (applicable to Commercial Item Acquisitions only) or Section M (applicable to other than Commercial Item Acquisitions only).  During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated.  Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors.

<CONTACT>kenneth hood, 757 878 2062
<DESC>Amendemnt 0001 to soliciation W911W6-05-R-0007 is issued to provide clarification to all prospective offerors.  The proposal closing date of 2:00 pm EDT 31 October 2005  will remain unchanged as a result of this amendment. 1.  Is the focus of Topic 01-2006 Structural Integrity Monitoring System structures only or are systems included? The desire for Topic 01-2006 is a Structural Integrity Monitoring System.  A sensor based system to monitor structural health to determine structural integrity is desired.  This topic is intended to focus on aircraft structural components (frames, stringer s, bulkheads, skin, rotors, etc.) not engines, weapons, or flight controls. 2.  Is one intention of the intentions of Topic 01-2006 Structural Integrity Monitoring System to focus on legacy retrofit for currently fielded fleet? Topic 01-2006 is intended to focus on generic aircraft structures.  The desire is not to develop an aircraft specific solution, but rather a technology that could be applied to existing legacy airframes as well new aircraft designs.  Therefore an open arch itecture, flexible system is desired.  The developed technology, however, could be demonstrated on an existing aircraft structural component.   3.  What are the particular components and failure modes of interest to your group?  Please identify key areas which you would like to see damaged growth monitored for demonstration/proof-of-concept purposes. The Army ultimately desires a structural integrity system for a wide range of rotary wing, fixed wing, and ground vehicles.  Because of the variety of structural configurations, this effort initially concentrates on demonstrating the feasibility of this te chnology on generic structure.  Once proven effective, we would like to expand the demonstration to a relevant helicopter structural component, such as a frame, bulkhead, stiffener, skin section, rotor, etc..  This follow-on demonstration may or may not oc cur under this specific BAA effort.  Also, the fact that rotorcraft operate in very harsh environments needs to be considered in the proposed solution and demonstration. As for damage modes, we would ideally like to detect and monitor any and all damage that would ultimately impact the structural integrity.  This would include, but not be limited to crack initiation and growth from both static and dynamic loading, environm ental issues such as corrosion, delamination, impact events (ballistic or low velocity), and crash or hard landing event, etc...  By detecting and monitoring damage, the intent is to determine the structures integrity and potentially forecast useful life o f the component.  Please keep in mind that these goals are very outreaching and may or may not be achievable under this specific effort. 4.  In the BAA it is stated that As an effort to better monitor rotorcraft's structural integrity, AATD is interested in developing and applying a Structural Integrity Monitoring System (SIMS) for the health monitoring of metallic and composite structural components.  As a result of differing materials and failure modes, unique SIMS solutions maybe required for composite and for metals.  Is TRL 6 demonstration of the SIMS to only metallic or only composite components acceptable?  In this event, much of the SIMS and algorithms maybe common between materials but sensing devices and data analysis methods may differ. Ultimately, a TRL 6 demonstration is desired for both metallic and composites, however keep in mind: Topic 01-2006 has the potential for multiple awards, which may address only part of the topic's objectives. 5.  In the BAA it stated AATD seeks proposals to develop and apply SIMS technologies to legacy and future rotorcraft generic structure.  In development of the technical approach, some PHM technologies are better suited to legacy or future platforms.   In making judgments between conflicting approaches, does AATD give priority to legacy or future platforms? No priority will be given, however a system with open architecture that could be applied to many different structural configurations is ultimately desired (if possible).  In keeping with this end goal, this effort intends to concentrate on proving the SIMS  technology on generic aircraft structure. 6.  Regarding Topic 02-2006, threat is described as 7.62 mm AP.  Is this the M2 round? The threats for US floor armor typically refer to Soviet rounds, e.g. 7.62x39 mm Type PS (ball) and 7.62x39 mm Type BZ (AP).  The US/NATO 7.62 mm AP M2 is in general a harder round to defeat.  While the synopsis does not specify the particular AP round, sp ecificity in any proposal will assist the Government in making a meaningful value judgment. 7.  On page 3 of 6 (bottom of page) in the Spaced Armor Protection System portion (03-2006) of the BAA, the protection requirement(s) of the desired system is/are based upon threats ranging from 7.62 to 14.5mm. Question: is AATD looking for four systems, o ne for each threat, or one system that will stop all threats described?  Obviously, the approach for the two paths would be much different.   Any approach, including those in the question, that develops the spaced armor concept with its inherent weight benefits, and is applicable to a rotorcraft system, will be considered.   Consistent with the Department of Defense's Rotary Wing Vehicle (RWV) Technology Development Approach (TDA), the offeror should take into consideration the weight requirements and/or weight constraints of aircraft ballistic protection.  It is pointless to meet a certain level of protection if the weight is impractical for rotorcraft.   Rotorcraft armor systems currently in use are capable of defeating 7.62 mm ball.  An improvement to at least 7.62 mm AP is desired.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF CONTACT: 
The Coast Guard is conducting market research in order to identify vendors who can provide commercially available marine crane units.  

SYNOPSIS:
1	General   
1.1	The government is considering replacement of marine crane units on the existing Coast Guard 110 ft WPB Class cutters.  The equipment will include the marine crane unit and supporting hydraulics.  The boat and cradle will be GFE.
1.2	The government is seeking information and interest from potential vendors who could provide equipment delivery.
2	Equipment: 
2.1	The marine crane will be used to lift, move to boarding position, board, launch, and recover a nominal 5.4 meter RHIB with two people onboard over either the port or starboard side of the cutter.  The marine crane system should operate in sea state conditions up to Sea State 5.  Total launching and recovery weight will be 2500 pounds including allowances for weight growth and boat replacement.  The existing cradle and equipment are on the centerline of the cutter.
2.2	The marine crane system will have the following modular components: 
•	Marine Crane unit, including rotation bearing
•	Aluminium Crane Column with bearing flange (mounts to existing deck connection)
•	Hydraulic Power Unit with motor controller (mounted below deck)
•	Walk-Around type crane control system.
•	Crane Control panel (electric panel, below deck)
•	Hydraulic Power Unit remote control from weatherdeck control stations.
2.3	The electro-hydraulic marine crane system should also meet the following conditions:  
2.3.1	The boom should extend to an outreach of 20 feet. 
2.3.2	The boom should retract to a maximum stowage length of 12 feet. 
2.3.3	The system should be designed for up to 30 degree side loading conditions during launch and recovery operations.   
2.4	The marine crane system is intended to be equipped with a walk-around type crane control system, permitting the operator to observe boat operations.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to participate in the development of a landing attenuation system for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).	NASA envisions this development project to include trade studies, energy absorber design, and characterization tests of candidate landing system configurations.	NASA is currently conducting market research to identify firms with specialized expertise in the design, analysis, and fabrication of energy absorbers capable of meeting the preliminary CEV landing specifications listed below.  Candidate energy absorber concepts include, but are not limited to air bags, crushable structures, and energy absorbing landing struts. Preliminary CEV Landing Attenuation System Specifications: The following landing attenuation system specifications are preliminary and therefore subject to change.  The specifications are intended to depict the general performance envelope of the anticipated landing attenuation system.  Specific, more-detailed performance requirements will be developed by the Government at a later date.   1.	The landing attenuation system shall be designed for a CEV landing within a Government-controlled land range in the continental United States, but must also be suitable for off-nominal water landings associated with launch abort scenarios. 2.	The landing attenuation system shall reduce the landing loads of the CEV to within human-acceptable limits.  The human-acceptable limits will be defined by the Government at a later date. 3.	The landing attenuation system shall prevent the CEV capsule from over-turning or rolling over during or after landing. 4.	The landing attenuation system shall operate within acceptable limits for the following ranges of landing conditions: •	Landed CEV Mass:		9,000 to 12,000 kg •	Landing Velocity (Vertical):	6 m/sec to 8 m/sec •	Landing Velocity (Horizontal):	0 m/sec to 8 m/sec •	Capsule Attitude:		0 degrees to 15 degrees relative to surface 5.	The landing attenuation system shall stow within the available volume within the CEV capsule, be capable of withstanding extended duration space environments, and then be capable of being deployed during the CEV terminal descent at Earth.  The available CEV volume will be provided by the Government at a later date. 6.	The landing attenuation system shall be capable of being successfully deployed at angles-of-attack up to +/- 20 degrees during the CEV terminal descent. 7.	The landing system shall be at a state of technological readiness such that a full-scale system can be designed, fabricated, and tested no later than November 1, 2006. When responding to this RFI, respondents shall address their capabilities and experience in the areas listed below.   a)	Design of landing attenuation systems for aerospace hardware, with specific emphasis on human-rated systems. b)	Energy absorber system analysis and modeling including deployment modeling and impact dynamic analysis. c)	Development testing and qualification testing of energy absorber systems including flight tests and drop tests. d)	Fabrication of energy absorber systems and related deployment systems. Respondents shall emphasize how their stated capabilities and experience relate to the specific performance requirements and challenges associated with developing the CEV landing attenuation system.

Description
The U.S. Department of Labor’s, Employee Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA) seeks comment on a DRAFT Statement of Work for a wholly outsourced, turnkey Information Technology (IT) system to be designed, developed, and operated by a private sector vendor under contract to the DOL.  The purpose of the IT system, known as EFAST2, is to receive, process, store, publicly disclose, distribute, and archive approximately 1.1 million electronically filed Form 5500 Series filings submitted annually by the public over the Internet.  Form 5500 Series filings (including Form 5500 and all schedules and attachments to these forms) are annual information returns that contain information on employee benefits plans, including both pension and welfare plans, and are required to be filed annually by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  Form 5500 Series filings may contain Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data and are therefore subject to commensurate security and handling protections.  EFAST2 will allow filers to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings via a secure web portal.  The Form 5500 Series electronic filings to be processed include structured data associated with forms and schedules, and unstructured data associated with attachments contained in PDF and text files.  The Department requires this capability to support its vision to mandate electronic filing of Form 5500 returns/reports, per the proposed regulation published in the Federal Register August 30, 2005

This RFP is being issued as a DRAFT for comment purposes only.  At this time the Department estimates that the period of performance for this effort will run from contract award through June 30, 2007 for Based Period (Prototype Development), July 1, 2007 through June 30,2008 for Option Period I (Production Scale-up), and July 1, 2008 through June 30 2018 for Option Periods II-XI (Operations). EBSA seeks comments on the DRAFT RFP from firms that are capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP, which can be summarized as follows: 1) Designing, developing, hosting, and maintaining a secure, scaleable web portal that allows users to electronically file Form Series 5500 filings; 2) Providing a system based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) allowing filers to submit filings directly through the website or via approved third party software; 3) Checking all filings for accuracy and completeness using XML schema validation and edit tests, and quickly returning acceptance/rejection messages to the filer via email; 4) Allowing stakeholders such as plan administrators, plan transmitters, and software developers to electronically register and attain electronic filing credentials. The system would verify these credentials upon receipt of each filing; 5) Providing a public disclosure website that allows the public, Government, and vendor contact center staff to access, view, and download filing facsimiles over the Internet; 6) Providing a contact center and related customer support features to filers, software developers, and other stakeholders interfacing with the system; 7) Providing support to third party software developers that develop electronic filing software with which filers may complete, validate, and submit filings electronically.  This support would include electronic filing technical specifications, technical support, testing, certification, and other ongoing support; 8) Managing all IT and related telecommunications equipment associated with the web portal; 9) Establishing and maintaining all required security on the portal based on varying degrees of access control and authorization, as well as physical, personnel, administrative, and computer security for the filing data, processing facility, and staff, including supporting Government conduct of a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) for each assigned staff member; 10) Establishing an end-to-end tracking function that records the processing history and current status of all filing submissions received; and 11) Meeting or exceeding the contractually specified timeliness and accuracy performance standards specified in the solicitation.  Please refer to the DRAFT RFP for additional information on the contractual terms and conditions, performance standards, functional, security, and other related requirements.  

Comments on this DRAFT RFP will be accepted via E-mail to mailto:EFAST2@dol.gov, but to be considered, comments must be received by November 30, 2005 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time.  This E-mail address is for receipt of comments only and shall not be used for any other correspondence.  Comments should clearly identify the name of the firm, contact information, and the specific section(s) of the DRAFT RFP referenced by the comment(s).

The Department is concurrently conducting market research in an effort to identify small businesses that are capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP.  Accordingly, small businesses capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP are encouraged to submit a brief corporate capability statement, including the identification and type of small business that you are (i.e., Women-Owned, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, etc.).    The NAICS Code identified for this requirement is 541512 with a size standard of $21,000,000.

This sources sought notice (i.e., RFI) is being issued for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  NO PROPOSALS SHALL BE ENTERTAINED BASED ON THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.

<DESC>Sources Sought for DOT certified Compressed Gas Cylinders 

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and supply availability of a Department of Transportation (DOT) certified Compressed Gas Cylinder as described follows:   

The USCG is looking for a Compressed Gas Cylinder that would be a form- fit-function DOT certified replacement for Compressed Gas P/N 2911154-3, NSN 8120-01-018-7764. Currently, the USCG uses 2 compressed gas cylinders to contain Freon Gas R-116 for the APS-137 Radar system on its fleet of 27 HC-130s. Therefore, the USCG are looking to procure 54 bottles for aircraft installation plus sparing. The replacement cylinder must be able to be transported via air and land while pressurized as per DOT (49CFR 178.44). Tavco Inc. of Chatsworth, CA, is the OEM of the cylinder currently used and due to the proprietary nature of the technical data; the USCG will be limited in proving manufacturing drawings and/or specifications to aid in this process. The USCG can provide responding parties a sample cylinder for evaluation and non-destructive testing to assist in the design/reverse engineering and budgetary quoting process for the replacement cylinder.
Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options (to include setup and takedown services if available).  Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  The Government believes the applicable NAICS Code is (this is for the example only) 333924 INDUSTRIAL TRUCK, TRACTOR, TRAILER, AND STACKER MACHINERY manufacturing, and 333999 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY MANUFACURING.  The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 750 employees.
Also, please respond to the following questions: 
(1) Is your business a large or small business? 
(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  
(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
(4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? 
(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  
(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   
(7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? 
(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers? 
(9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  
After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to Mr. Ray Lopez, USCG Equipment Specialist, at Bldg 78, U.S. Coast Guard, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to raymond.lopez@uscg.mil.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received no later than 22 November 2005 at 13:00 p.m. EST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>38 -- Skidsteer Masticating Heads
<DESC>IBET Acquisitions anticipates awarding a non-competitive contract to Fecon Resource Recovery Equipment & Systems to furnish masticating heads for the Adaptive Management Services Enterprise Team.  The masticating heads are used in forest fuels treatment.  Originally, other manufacturers were considered but there are several unique aspects of the Fecon Bull Hog masticating head.  The most crucial of which is the vertical mounting, which limits the potential for injury to the operator and those on-site by generating smaller chip sizes than other products and directing them into the soil.  The smaller chip sizes eliminate the need for prescribed fire follow-up, which will work well in terms of air pollution and wildland-urban interface.  The design attaches the tool with a bolt for easy replacement.  The Forest Service intends to use the Bull Hog attachment on a skidsteer.  The model of Fecon Bull Hog used with the skidsteer also has an hydraulic brake feature on the rotor, which quickens stopping and allows the operator to exit more safely.  Vendors believing they can meet this requirement must submit written technical information showing clearly that the product(s) proposed meet(s) or exceed(s) the performance of the Fecon Bull Hog masticating head.  Also include estimated cost for any proposed product, including delivery and installation (if needed).  All information must be received no later than 2:00 pm PT on October 26, 2005.  Mail to 631 Coyote Street, Nevada City, CA 95959, ATTN: Contracting, or FAX to 530-478-6126.

<SUBJECT>D -- Commercial Satellite Communications
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) will host Commercial Satellite Communications (COMMSATCOM) Capabilities Focused Industry Days on Tuesday, November 8 and Wednesday, November 9, 2005.  The purpose of this unclassified conference is to enable the Department of Defense (DOD) representatives to obtain information from industry experts on Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) COMMSATCOM commercial practices and how industry might best meet DOD needs.  This information will be used by DOD to better understand industry’s ability to support a core set of COMMSATCOM user needs and user-selectable enhancements.  This information will be fundamental to shaping DOD’s future COMMSATCOM efforts.  FSS operators, managed service providers, and system engineering and integration (SE&I) resellers are encouraged to attend.  Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) will not be addressed as part of this Industry Days.

Background: COMMSATCOM is an essential component of today’s DOD communications.  Current capacity of on-orbit Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) systems cannot meet the increasing communications demands of the joint warfighters.  To augment the existing MILSATCOM capacity, DOD leases capacity on commercial satellites and procures or leases terminals to satisfy operational requirements.  The current services include leased C- and Ku-band COMMSATCOM worldwide bandwidth totaling approximately 4 GHz.  Along with leasing bandwidth, DOD contracts for associated SE&I services such as planning, engineering, network operations center support, service level agreement (SLA) management, operational spectrum monitoring of leased service, turn-key service, earth terminal installation, host nation agreements, licensing, troubleshooting assistance, and administrative support.  These services are obtained through multiple contractors that procure bandwidth from multiple global and regional service providers around the world.

A core set of user capabilities has been identified.  To focus the scope of this conference, these user capabilities are presented with associated key questions in Attachment 1 to this Request for Information (RFI).  DISA requests advance responses be submitted via e-mail to commsatcom.rfi@disa.mil no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) Wednesday, October 26, 2005.  Early receipt of the responses will allow DOD representatives time to review information prior to the Industry Days and use the one-on-one session more efficiently. Updates to responses, as needed, can be made, however, the submissions on October 26, 2005 will be reviewed prior to Industry Days, so all changes should be clearly marked in the final responses.  Final responses to RFI questions (in CD and ten (10) hard copies as well) should be mailed to Booz Allen Hamilton, 8281 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102 (Attn: Marjorie Quinteros; Allen 590 (Tel: 703.377.6452)) and RECEIVED by 2:00 PM EST, FRIDAY, 4 NOVEMBER 2005.  Responses (either submissions on October 26, 2005 or final responses) shall be no more than 25 pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font with one inch margins.

Specific contracting opportunities are not available and will not be discussed at this conference.  Because this conference’s purpose is for the Government to better understand the ability for the COMMSATCOM industry to support DOD users’ capability needs, the conference agenda is primarily allocated to government questioning.

The conference will be held on Tuesday, 8 November 2005 and Wednesday, 9 November 2005, at the Booz Allen Hamilton facility at One Dulles Center, 13200 Woodland Park Road, Herndon, Virginia 20171 and a conference room at the Days Inn Hotel and Conference Center at 2220 Centreville Road, Herndon, VA 20170.  Attendees should arrive between 7:00 am EST and 8:00 am EST for check-in and registration at Days Hotel and Conference Center on 8 November 2005.    No registration for one-on-one conferences will be made during the conference.  The conference will begin promptly at 8:30 am EST.  Coffee will be available, but no food will be provided, so plan accordingly.

The conference will consist of a morning session, beginning at 8:30 am EST on Tuesday, November 8 and lasting until approximately 12:00 noon EST.  Government representatives will provide introductory remarks and address various topics, including recent DOD COMMSATCOM activities, the conference agenda and ground rules.  Up to three company representatives will have the opportunity to attend the morning session and meet in the private one-on-one session with DOD COMMSATCOM program and operations management.  
Attendees are expected to be COMMSATCOM operations, sales, and technical staff that can answer the specific RFI questions.  The afternoon of November 8, starting around 1:00 p.m. and all day on November 9 will consist of one hour one-on-one government-industry sessions.  
Schedules will be enforced, and the first fifty minutes will involve questioning by the Government to better understand company RFI responses.  The final ten minutes will be set aside to allow each company to either elaborate on previously discussed points or to offer other industry insights regarding COMMSATCOM.  Sales pitches or marketing material will not be accepted.  No cameras, tape recorders, or other reproduction devices are allowed during Industry Days and the Government will not accept any materials that were not actually part of the contractor’s briefing.

Attendance will be limited solely to pre-registered attendees, and conference attendance will be limited to not more than 3 attendees per company.  A total of 100 seats will be available for industry on a first come, first serve reservation basis for the plenary session in the morning.  

Reservation for the one-on-one sessions will be made through Defense Information Technology Contracting Office (DITCO) by contacting either John Herrmann at 618-229-9722 or Cindy Showers at 618-229-9464.  Registrants must provide the names of up to three individuals attending, including their position/title, name of the company/organization, type of organization (integrator, reseller, satellite provider, etc), telephone number, type of business (small, large, small disadvantaged, etc), date of session and request either a morning or afternoon slot.  Reservations will be scheduled and confirmed by phone only.  Requests will be granted on a first come-first serve basis until all the slots are filled.  After the slots are filled, a waiting list will be developed and cancellations will be filled from the waiting list.  DITCO will release a tentative schedule for one-on-one sessions between industry and government representatives and notify the registrants in advance of Industry Days.  THE DEADLINE FOR REGISTRATION IS 2:00 pm EST, FRIDAY, 21 OCTOBER 2005. 

The government may request additional information from those responding to this RFI.  An attachment to this RFI contains additional information including Rules of Engagement for Industry and Industry Day questions.  This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Army is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it will have to consider the MILCON Program to ope n up its Program to many different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.   Industry shared four major recommendations: 1. Utilize industry best practices, standards and codes. 2.Utilize performance based (outcome oriented) type contracts versus its current prescriptive specifications that specify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, a nd when each phase of the construction will be completed . 3. Construction methods such as pre-fabricated, pre-engineered, panelized or tilt-up walls and permanent modular construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in order to meet the needs of the Army.  4. The government could achieve cost savings through bulk buys of materials if awarded more than one of the same type of facility. ************************************************************************************ Northwestern Division (NWD) is still seeking feedback from the construction industry in order to determine our acquisition strategy for the FY06-FY11 Military Construction Program based on the three (3) Pre-solicitation meetings at Fort Riley, Fort Carson,  Ft. Lewis, and the Market Research Questionnaire. In order to determine the best acquisition strategies we need to identify firms capable of performing contracts of various sizes and locations. A survey has been developed to assist us structuring the number and type of contracts needed to accomplish the p roposed program which could exceed $2B over the next few years. NWD covers 14 states and due to the geographic and market diversity we are considering dividing our region into five zones to promote maximum participation by small and local businesses. ************************************************************************************ The zones are defined and are used in the survey as follows: Zone 1 - Northern Plains (ND, SD, MN, WI) Ellsworth & Minot AFB, Ft.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Length of service    includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or       successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the          performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)      HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther   King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,        Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A    contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay   in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR     4.174)                                                                             THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS   (as numbered):                                                                     1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.           UNIFORM ALLOWANCE                                                             If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract     (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state     or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by      laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by   an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the     wage determination. Th e Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance      with the following standards as compliance:                                        The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an       adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the         actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance   is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors     subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide            collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the           furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all     employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67   cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are       made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other    personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry            cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the             cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,   by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement   that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.                        ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **                                    Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the      Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes,              prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only       upon such contingencies as approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage          determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract,            adjusting the contract price, etc. (The relevant CBA section) in the collective   bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that      Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting arm's length negotiation under    section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage        determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits     paid under the predecessor contract.                                               Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:                                     The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the         Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fourth Edition, January 1993,     as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise             indicated. This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of             Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents,      U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Copies of specific job    descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer.        REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard     Form 1444 (SF 1444)}                                                               Conformance Process:                                                               The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which     is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the     work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage     determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable      relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted   classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such     conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished      the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such      unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or   fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.     {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a      contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to     which a class(es) is to be conformed.                                              The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:                     1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed      occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).                                     2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in       order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for      each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed    wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of     the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no      authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be         submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted     class(es) of employees performs any contract work.                                 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a      report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent     information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the     Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of    Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).           4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or    disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or       notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to          process the request.                                                               5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the             contractor.                                                                        6) The contractor informs the affected employees.                                  Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond       paper.                                                                             When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of       Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure   that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in      the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required        tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage            determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or     subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
