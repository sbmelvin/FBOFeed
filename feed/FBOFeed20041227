<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: - Open House & Air Show 2005


The year 2005 marks the 102nd year of powered flight! We at Edwards Air Force Base will celebrate the Annual Air Show by paying tribute to all those who developed, acquired, and sustained the air and space power needed to defend the United States. This year’s Open House and Air Show will be held on October 29-30, and we anticipate an amazing day of daring aerial acts and displays of fascinating flight technology.  Edwards AFB is where tomorrow’s Air Force is tested, and we are extremely proud of this installation, its rich history, and the role it has in the advancement of aviation. This promises to be a very special Open House and Air Show, and so that you may share in this occasion, we invite you to partner with us in this event. Sponsorship is an essential element for the continuation and success of programs such as this, and we are requesting your company’s support.  Sponsorship is contributed in the form of monetary and/or in-kind contributions. As a return on your investment, your company may receive unprecedented recognition in the form of audio, print and visual media coverage. Sponsor exposure, with varying sponsorship levels, may include name/logo recognition, brochures, media coverage, feature articles, photo opportunities, posters, and will be prominently acknowledged throughout the event.  All offers will be considered. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept offers for sponsorships from any contractor, including their affiliates (division, business groups, subsidiaries, etc.) subcontract arrangements, teaming partners and joint venture partners who are currently participating in, or who intend to participate in, any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), or will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,000 or more.  If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the Government.  More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered.  Requests for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than September 22, 2005.  This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non-appropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government.  It does not obligate appropriated funds of the government.  For more information or sponsorship opportunities, contact Melissa L. Ackman at (661) 277-3802 or E-mail address: Melissa.ackman@edwards.af.mil

<DESC>This synopsis constitutes an announcement of the release of Solicitation Number N00019-05-R-0007 (previously pre-solicitation number N00019-04-R-0101) for P-3 Special Structural Inspections (SSI), Enhanced Special Structural Inspections (ESSI), SSI-Kits (SSI-K), Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), and Modification/Installation Programs (MIP) required by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).  The solicitation has been released on the NAVAIR website at:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  This requirement is for efforts consisting of an intensive depot level process for airframe and component inspection, deficiency identification, and correction to ensure safe and reliable operation as well as to enhance the aircraft service life expectancy to sustain inventory levels throughout the service period.  SSI is a detailed inspection to detect fatigue damage in critical outer wing locations.  This requires significant material removal in order to gain access to the structure for inspections.  Material repair/replacement includes the removal and repair/replacement of the outer wing lower forward spar cap.  ESSI includes SSI inspections and is a major preemptive structural repair to the inner and outer wing surfaces, plates, beam, planks and fittings, with inspection and on-condition repair of center wing structure and fuel weep holes.  SSI-K is an ESSI inspection with mandatory material replacement for the outer wing, center wing box and horizontal stabilizer structural components.  PDM is scheduled depot level maintenance requirements to ensure the timely discovery and correction for actual and/or anticipated defects.  MIP efforts include the installation of Government Furnished Equipment and the maintenance, repair, removal, and test of aircraft components, avionics, aircraft structures and associated ground equipment for the USN and FMS customer P-3/S-3 T/M/S aircraft.  It is anticipated that the Government will award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price contract(s) for a base year and four one-year option periods.  Additionally, each year will contain over-and-above contract line items to cover efforts outside the scope of the basic contract requirements.  The Government intends, but does not guarantee, to make multiple awards.  The small business reserve is not a formal set-aside but rather reserved for small business participation.  Furthermore, award to a small business is contingent upon the small business being eligible under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336411, with a size standard of 1500 employees, and being both technically acceptable and generally evaluated to be in line with all other proposals being considered for award.  All documentation for this effort can be obtained at the following NAVAIR website:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  Additionally, all future correspondence will be available on the NAVAIR website.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106(b), with The University of North Carolina at Charlotte to acquire assistance with research and development services for advancement of surface and coordinate metrology dimensional measurement.  

The Sole source determination is based on the Government’s need for a contractor with a combination of (a) surface metrology and (b) coordinate measurements that have features with a size larger than those measured by surface instruments but smaller than the range measured by coordinate measuring machines.
Dr. Jayarama Raja of The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is uniquely qualified to meet the Government’s need due to his combined knowledge and documented expertise in both surface metrology and coordinate measurements.  Dr. Raja has over 20 years of experience in surface texture and small feature metrology; chairs standards committees on surface texture; and has 2 years of experience specifically in the field of very low force small feature measurements. The government anticipates the award of firm-fixed price purchase order on or about October 26, 2004. The period of performance will be one year, with work to be performed at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD facility.*****

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by 10/27/2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Institute (ATC), Core Genotyping Facility (CFG) intends on procuring on a sole source basis with M.J. Research, 5350 Capital Court, Suite 102, Reno, NV 89502 to provide one year maintenance service for existing government owned Tetrad Thermocycling systems.   This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $6.0M. The CGF assesses human genetic variation, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and other types of genetic variation (microsatelites, insertion/deletion mutations etc.) in a large number of separate population and family studies initiated by NCI investigators. Currently the CGF is utilizing four major technology platforms to assess human genetic variation: 1) Taqman Fluorescent 5' Nuclease cleavage, 2) Primer Extension detected by Matrix Assisted Laser Deionization/Adsorption - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) nucleotide extension, 3) Fluorescent DNA fragment analysis and sequencing detected by automated capillary electrophoresis systems, and 4) MGB EClipse 3' Hybridization Triggered Fluorescene. To accomplish this goal, NCI CGF is expected to implement a combination of high-throughput platforms and automated sample manipulation. The NCI CGF focus is on several well-established, high-throughput combinations of genotyping platforms and chemistries, all of which depend on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR and extension reactions are accomplished in 96- and 384- well MJ Tetrad Thermocycling systems. In order for NCI CGF to reach its expected production milestones all the M.J. Research systems must work constantly for up to 10 hours every day. With a maintenance agreement in place with M.J. Research, this would assure the NCI CGF continued production. The Tetrad Thermocycling systems are sensitive instruments that oftentimes require technical assistance, which require experienced person to repair. M.J. Research is the only known source to the NCI researcher that can provide such services to the aforementioned system. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on January 5, 2004, faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Kathy Fain, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-4853, Fax 410-965-9560, Email kathryn.fain@ssa.gov
<DESC>:  The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with SOFTBASE SYSTEMS INC, 1200 RIDGEFIELD BLVD, ASHEVILLE, NC 28806, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” to purchase upgrades to software already installed and in use at SSA Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21235, and corresponding upgrades to maintenance on that Government owned SOFTBASE software.  The additional capacity shall be installed and placed on maintenance within FY2005 (i.e. before Oct 1, 2005).  The software licensing authority, and concurrent maintenance, is needed to support the projected growth in processing requirements.  SSA mainframes have been running near or at full capacity, and significant increases in volume of activity are anticipated in FY05.  Higher level mainframes have been/will be installed this year to deal with the upsurge in the workload.  A large portion of the boost in demand can be attributed directly to the additional workload resulting from the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act.  Increased capacity is crucial to the continuation of SSA’s mission. SSA must therefore purchase upgrades in order to continue legal usage of the software to be transferred to those mainframes, and will be doing so throughout fiscal year 2005 by way of modifying the existing contract/order as needed.  This is proprietary software and Softbase Systems, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing the required license upgrade and maintenance support.  Maintenance support provides the required software fixes, corrections and revisions necessary to ensure a stable processing environment.  Without maintenance support, the SSA software developers would experience degraded services, which would impact software development deadlines.  This software is a test and development support tool, used in the construction and maintenance of an application test environment.  SSA uses this software for the creation of realistic and representative test data essential to the integrity of SSA’s programs.  The software helps to streamline and simplify SSA’s application development environment, while satisfying applicable security and privacy requirements.  SOFTBASE has no authorized resellers.  The anticipated description, and quantity are as follows: Additional 162 MIPS for TESTBASE (formerly DGF-Data Generation Facility), and maintenance, for a total of 962 MIPS.  SOFTBASE is the only authorized dealer known to the Government. The Government anticipates acquiring additional capacity through modifications to the existing purchase order.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, under the authority cited above.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit an offer.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all offers received within the response date of the publication will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The TSA intends to negotiate separate single-source contracts with InVision Technologies and L-3 Communications Corporation for maintenance of Government owned and/or operated Explosive Detection System (EDS) and Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-ray (TRX) equipment.  The purpose of this work is to perform both corrective and preventive maintenance for the identified equipment.  

TSA is negotiating single-source contracts because only these two vendors, InVision Technologies (of Newark, CA) and L-3 Communications (of St. Petersburg, FL) can perform the subject work.  Both vendors are the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for the Government owned EDS and TRX equipment.  Only the OEMs for this equipment have the requisite expertise to perform the work.  The OEMs have been performing this maintenance work for the past two years.  

TSA anticipates award of a five year maintenance contract to each vendor.  Each contract will have a one year base and four one-year options.  The anticipated award date for these contracts is February 2005.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Water and Climate Center, located in Portland, OR is comtemplating awarding a follow-on contract to Meteor Communication Corporation for specialized meteor burst communication equipment.  This equipment helps operates and maintain an extensive, automated system to collect Snow Pack Telemetry (SNOTEL).  SNOTEL uses meteor burst communications technology to collect and communicate data in near-real time.  This technolgoy makes use of proprietary software and patented hardware to rapidly transmit small packets of meteorological data to two NRCS owned master stations.  These master stations use existing custom hardware and software to decode, assemble, and forward remote station data to a centralized computer facility where it is stored and made available for general use.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (2) (ii) (A) (B), awarding this specialized equipment to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  It would also incur unacceptable project development delays to fulfill agency requirements.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILALE.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions which have been posed by various vendors; subsequently, the expiration date for all quotes has been extended to 12/30/2004.  See the provided information below: Question:  Are Line Items 1-6 comprised of metal frames, cardboard frames or bags? Response:  Metal frames. Question:  Can you provide arbitrary/past history pricing on these items? Response:  No Question:  Is this an IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) requirement? Response:  Yes Question:  So that I may calculate freight rate pricing in my quote, how many filters are to be delivered at one time?  Response: Unfortunately, the government can not specify or guarantee that a specific or set number of filters will need to be delivered at any one time nor can the government specify the total number of deliveries required in any given year.  Question:  Do the filters have to be manufactured by Perolator? Response:  No the filter does not have to be manufactured by Perolator, but the filters do have to be technically acceptable and a "like item" which is "equal to or better than" the Perolator product. Question:  Does the "85" in Line Item 1- FAC 85 4412 represent the efficiency level? Response:  Yes Question:  Do I need to provide pricing for the base year and the additional 4 option years? Response:  Yes.  If pricing is not listed for the option years, the government will assume that the base year pricing and each option year will have the same price-point.  Question:  Is the deliver by date in block 6 of 01/02/2006 correct? Response:  Yes.  The conclusion of the period of performance for the base year is 1/02/2006 although remember this is an IDIQ requirement various delivery dates may arise throughout the course of the next calendar year.  Question:  What type of heating and air-conditioning units must the filters fit? Response:  Temtrol Model Numbers:  WF-DH-25, WF-DH-21, WF-DH-38, WF-DH-28, WF-DH-12, WF-DH-4 and Trane M-Series:  MCCB021UAOBOUA and MCCB006UAOUB. The request for quote expiration date has been extended from the previous time and date of 2:00PM on 12/29/2004.  Quotes are now due at 4:00pm (EST) on 12/30/2004.  All questions regarding this requirement must be submitted by 2:00PM (EST) on 12/29/2004, no questions will be answered after such time.  If you have submitted a quote prior to this modification to solicitation please confirm via e-mail cdonahue@usgs.gov or phone 703-648-7389 that the pricing in your quote has not changed as a result of this amendment.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

The solicitation includes the Baghdad Station and two remote locations: the Technical Station and Shalchia Workshops. The distance from the Baghdad Central Station to the Technical Department is about 2.0 Km. The distance from Baghdad Central Station to Shalchia is approximately 4.5 Km.

For cabling, assume CAT 6 cabling (the solicitation originally called for CAT 5E cabling). 

The solicitation is modified to include training for 10 persons in UAE for not more than 2 months of an Advanced Networking Training Software and Hardware course

The LAN shall include a hardware back-up system for the servers. The contractor shall provide a minimum of 5 servers (the solicitation originally called for 4 servers). An E-mail server is not needed (the IRR has one already).

The contractor will determine the specifications for the core switches. Net Monitor specifications will be left to the contractor.

Maps of the Baghdad Station are posted to the website. Maps are not currently available for the Technical Station and Shalchia Shops. These two buildings resemble open bays, similar to a garage with a few offices on the periphery. The IRR are working on getting plans scanned, and they will be posted if they are made available.

The web pages are dynamic and they are for sharing files. 

Regarding applications on the 150 desktops, licensed versions are only needed for the Microsoft Office software. Licenses are not needed on the department-specific software.

The internet currently in the Baghdad Station is for 29 users (star 2 net) and it is a shared system with a download speed of (2048 Mbps) and an upload speed of (512Mbps).

If the bidder finds that their wiring scheme requires more than 5 UPSs, then the quote should include the appropriate number of UPSs. UPSs are not required for the 150 desktops.

The UPSs shall be compatible with the Iraqi electrical system (i.e. 380V, 3-phase, 50 Hz for the UPS input). The UPS output shall be 220V, single-phase voltage, 6000W-7500W. The balance of the equipment (desktops, printers, scanners, etc) shall be compatible with 220V single-phase voltage.

The walls and ceilings in the Baghdad Station vary in thickness. On average, they are 45cm thick.

Section 2.2.2 of the Scope of the Work states, “Proxy Server for Caching Internet web pages, Internet web server, file/print services, email, fax, network monitoring tools, anti-virus protection (such as a McAfee server and license), system backup and restore capabilities, file server/data archival capabilities, and network security/firewall mechanisms.”  Fax refers to fax server. There is not a limitation on the number of servers, if the bidder finds the specified minimum quantity of 5 servers is not sufficient.

The IRR will identify rooms on the first and second floors for switch racks if necessary. There are ample rooms available. . 

The number of users accessing the software at once could be more than 100 users. The client server should accommodate this demand. 


The quote / proposal is due at 1700 hours, Baghdad time, on 15 January 2005.  The PCO contracting Point-of-Contact is Charles T. Clements, 703-343-9218, charles.clements@cpa-iq.org.  The address is PCO Contracting, APO, AE 09316.

U.S. COAST GUARD, HU-25 ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS REPAIR, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: 

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.  The engine electrical components are essential to the engine control and distribution system utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of aircraft.

OBJECTIVE: The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to repair and provide complete, ready-to-install engine electrical components for the HU-25 that are certified for flight with an FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document.  The Coast Guard desires a Turn-Around-Time of no greater than 180 days from time of material receipt at contractor’s facility to prevent Aircraft On Ground (AOG) supply issues.

REQUIREMENTS: A.  Repaired components must comply with the current Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) specifications, drawings, Service Bulletins, and performance requirements as set forth in the OEM technical specifications.  The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to; required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts storage, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc.  Components must be hermetically sealed in anti-static plastic with desiccant to maintain humidity levels at 10% or less.  They must be packaged in a sealed container with solid core, form-fitting foam, and a minimum of 2.5 inches thick on all surfaces.  The use of chipped foam, Styrofoam "peanuts", shredded paper, or other similar material is not acceptable.  The packaging must protect components during normal ground or air transportation and during storage in a climate controlled facility for up to 2 years.  Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  B. To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 1.Technical: (a) Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, fixtures and parts to meet current OEM specifications as referenced in above Paragraph A. (b) Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan.  (c) Provide evidence of, and ability to maintain, a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.  2.Past Performance (a).  Provide documentation of having performed repair of similar or like items.  (b). Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address. 

Service Bulletins: All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.  Upon receipt of a component requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations. Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  The price proposal should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.  Data availability: OEM Technical data, Service Bulletins, drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the U.S. Coast guard; Coast Guard specific Coast Guard Technical Orders (CGTO’s) and ARSC drawings can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
