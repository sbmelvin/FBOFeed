The Contractor will be required to furnish, operate, and maintain tactically-relevant aircraft for air-to-air tracking, targeting, and ADAIR operations. This includes associated equipment systems that interface with various platforms and ground force personnel.

Estimated flying hour requirements are between 4,500 flying hours and 5,600 flying hours per year, depending on the available budget and demand for ADAIR services.</p>

This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in offering aviation and flight training. These establishments may offer vocational training, recreational training, or both.</p>

The use of oral presentations as an evaluation method during source selection are being contemplated. Upon successful award of a contract, the Contractor must make its facilities, aircraft, and operations available to the United States Government (USG) Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) for inspection. Contract performance is on condition of the acceptance of risk and the issuance of a Military Flight Release (MFR) and placed under a Public Aircraft Operation (PAO). Award is contemplated on the basis of best value utilizing a subjective tradeoff source selection with technical approach, risk, price, and past performance all as factors. Anticipated milestones are as follows:<br />- Draft Solicitation Documents - November 2017<br />- Solicitation - Early January 2018<br />- Proposals due - Early February 2018<br />- Contract Award - Late May/Early June 2018</p>
<p>The solicitation/RFP will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web page. Paper copies will not be made available.

<DESC><p align="left">The product required is the Inverter/Control Assembly Test Set (P/N: 16U4255-1, NSN: 4920-01-097-0452). The test set consists of circuits to functionally test and isolate faults of the inverter/control assembly which consists of a battery control unit, and inverter, and a NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set monitors power inputs from aircraft essential dc buses 1 and 2 and, in the event of loss of these inputs, automatically switches to output of the emergency generator converter unit. In the event the voltage of these power inputs is less than the battery voltage, the inverter will switch to the flight control inverter battery assembly as a source of power. The test set simulates these signals to the inverter/control assembly and monitors outputs of the assembly. The inverter/control assembly can be tested with or without the NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set will simulate both a good and malfunctioning battery assembly. Surplus is acceptable as long as it is new or reconditioned. As long as the equipment is fully functional and operates according to instructions in T.O. 8C3-11-3-7-1, surplus equipment in either state is acceptable.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

FOB Origin and Inspection and Acceptance at Destination are required. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. This material is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item.

All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. <br />Surplus material will not be considered. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

<CONTACT>Jose A. Zarzar, Senior Acquisition & Assistance Specialist, Email jzarzar@usaid.gov
<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to release a solicitation to support the Amazon region countries in their efforts to reduce the negative impacts on Amazon forests and water resources from large scale infrastructure projects, extractive activities, and climate change.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This activity will contribute to the achievement of the Project Purpose by promoting environment and social best practices. Through the activity, USAID seeks to focus neither on supporting nor inhibiting the extraction of resources or development of infrastructure, but rather to ensure that such activities, where they occur, are done in a way that safeguards natural resources and indigenous rights and cultures in the Amazon region.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objectives of the Activity are:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">1.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;</span>To reduce biodiversity loss, deforestation, and forest fragmentation in high priority landscapes of the Amazon Region; and</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">2.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;</span>To reduce loss of water systems&rsquo; integrity and quality in the main-stem Amazon River, (the principal trunk of a river or a stream), key tributaries, and associated aquatic areas (swamps, lagoons, marshes, etc.).</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The successful achievement of the activities objectives shall use innovative approaches in collaboration with civil society and the public and private sectors to conserve biodiversity and prevent deforestation in the Amazon region. This must involve the identification, adoption, implementation, and monitoring of best management practices of infrastructure and extractive activities in the Amazon region. Engagement with the private sector, key government agencies, and communities (particularly those of vulnerable indigenous and local populations), implementing and affected by these development projects is also essential to reducing the negative impacts of infrastructure and extractive activities on Amazon forests, peoples, and waters.</p>

Pre-Solicitation notice only
New Mexico VA Health Care System requests information for onsite unscheduled repairs and scheduled preventative maintenance services by a service vendor with access to Eaton s proprietary (copyrighted) service software and repair documentation is required to maintain numerous UPS systems that support mission critical medical equipment throughout the hospital. The potential failure of UPS systems at NMVAHCS exposes mammography systems, MRI scanners, CT scanners, nuclear medicine cameras, the PET/CT system, cardiac catheterization lab systems, interventional angiography systems, and medical servers to damage and failure due to changes in the supplied utility power to the systems. Required services include unscheduled onsite repairs, scheduled preventative maintenance (PM) services for UPS systems, associated battery cabinets and/or packs, and replacement of batteries. 
Vendors must have a current Eaton service contract for access to Eaton s proprietary information. 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government is not obligated to nor will it pay for or reimburse any costs associated with responding to this sources sought synopsis request.  This notice does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The Government will be restricted to this information to match information to a possible solicitation.  Public Law 109-461 mandates the VA to consider a total set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set aside. However, if response by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms proves inadequate, an alternate set-aside or full and open competition may be determined.  There is no anticipated sub-contracting opportunity for this procurement.  

Notice to potential offerors: All offerors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov before responding to any Government inquiry.  Additionally, all Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses or Veteran Owned Businesses who plan to submit an offer must register with the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise VetBiz Registry located at http://vip.vetbiz.gov.  

Please contact Michael Cordeiro at Michael.Cordeiro@va.gov.

<DESC>Construction project: Little Goose Powerhouse Oil Skimmer
<p>The work described herein at Little Goose Powerhouse shall include but not be limited to the following:</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the project is to prevent oil from entering the navigable waterways of the Snake River from the power house at Little Goose Dam. As the drainage sump is a low point with systems of drains and piping interconnected to collect water, it may also collect any unintended oil spills throughout the operating facility. This project will install a system of weirs and a belt skimmer in the drainage gallery to retrieve any unintended oils from the water prior to discharging the water into the river.</p>
<p>The work consists of concrete cutting and coring and of rounding concrete corners. Concrete cutting and coring will be through concrete 2' thick, including rectangular openings on the order of 3' by 1', and core drilling on the order of 6" diameter or less. Install a system of weirs in the drainage gallery, access hatches for the weirs and skimmer belt, piping in the drainage gallery to collect and route leakage water to the north end of main unit 1, a belt skimmer located in the draft tube access gallery where it passes over the drainage gallery with the skimmer belt dipping into the drainage gallery, emergency closure gate at the skimmer belt hatch, decanter tank at the skimmer outlet, and oil collection tank to hold the oil recovered by the skimmer. A pump will be provided for pumping the collected oil into disposal containers and electrical controls and annunciation will be provided to control the operation of the skimmer. Overhead hoist system, 2 ton capacity, will be installed for equipment handling. The flow of water into the drainage gallery cannot be stopped, therefore, the contractor will be responsible for care and diversion of water to maintain acceptable working conditions in the drainage gallery during the construction period. Work will also involve the removal and reinstallation of an 18" gate valve.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>Solicitation is set-aside for small business concerns. Solicitation Number W912EF18B0002 will be posted to the FedBizOpps (FBO) website on or about 04 December 2017. The bid opening date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.</p>
<p>A site visit will be offered approximately 2 weeks after the solicitation is posted. Refer to the solicitation for details regarding the site visit.</p>
<p>Place of Performance is the Little Goose Powerhouse located near Dayton, Washington, Columbia County.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed-price construction contract. Magnitude of Construction is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to WaveMark, Inc. for proprietary Cath Lab Maintenance services.

The Department recognizes the value of technical voices from industry and encourages those voices to be at the forefront in responding to this Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>Cloud Acquisition Considerations</p>
<p>Below are some considerations to help industry best respond to this RFI:</p>
<p>1.	This is an acquisition for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).  This requirement does not include Software as a Service (SaaS).  <br />2.	The tactical edge and delivering services to the warfighter matter.  The required cloud services must extend from the homefront to the tactical edge, to include austere and connectivity/communication deprived environments, and be able to support closed loop networks supporting warfighting operations.  <br />3.	This acquisition will require services in CONUS and OCONUS locations at all classification levels.<br />4.	DoD is seeking technical parity with commercial cloud, even if private or hybrid cloud services are part of the final solution.  <br />5.	DoD is seeking to capitalize and rely on the services and expertise of the cloud provider(s) to the greatest extent possible to include management of facilities and infrastructure at higher classification levels.<br />6.	DoD is prepared to pursue the revision of existing policies and federal regulations remove barriers to success.  Revisions are not guaranteed and will require the balancing of many factors, including security and reliability.<br />7.	DoD is seeking firm-fixed (i.e., catalogue) prices for all services under this indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  <br />8.	DoD is considering in-depth technical analysis of the current environment, cloud migration support, change management, and training services to be within scope of this contract.<br />9.	A contract award is planned for fiscal year 2018.</p>
<p>Questions for RFI Respondents</p>
<p>Given the considerations set forth above, DoD is seeking targeted feedback from potential cloud providers and other vendors with relevant information for the following questions broken out by subject area.  Partial responses are acceptable although complete responses to all questions are preferred understanding that some questions may be inapplicable to your company depending on the kinds of offerings you provide.</p>
<p>I.  Lessons Learned<br />1.	For large customers with a worldwide presence, what kind of personnel resources internal to the customer do you recommend be available to facilitate and support workload migrations?  What kind of enterprise program office structure and governance oversight would you recommend based on your experience? <br />2.	What are the main factors that contribute to system migration failure from your experience?  How can those risks be mitigated? <br />3.	What kind of customer processes or behaviors have you found essential to enable the optimization of using cloud infrastructure?<br />4.	What internal support structures and resources would you recommend for an organization that wishes to capitalize on the sharing of data across the cloud in order to support data-driven decision making and big data analysis?<br />5.	In your experience, what are the key factors to securing information in an enterprise cloud infrastructure? What are the primary risks to mitigate in this environment?</p>
<p>II.  Pricing and Services<br />1.	Please describe and provide information about your typical pricing structure for IaaS and/or PaaS.  <br />a.	What kind of fixed price pricing structure would you recommend DoD use for this solicitation?  What kind of CLIN structure would you recommend?  Please provide an example or commercial pricing list/structure as part of your response.  DoD is interested in a utility-based model based on usage paid in arrears.<br />2.	Please describe in detail the services that comprise your IaaS, PaaS, and/or other relevant offerings. Explain and diagram the infrastructure architecture in detail.  Additionally:<br />a.	If you provide cloud migration support as part of your IaaS/PaaS offerings, please describe in detail the scope of those services, how many employees you have that provide this service (distinguishing between direct employees and subcontractors), and where additional services from another vendor may be required to successfully migrate a system workload.<br />i.	Explain how you would recommend cloud migration support be provided in OCONUS garrison environments.<br />b.	Please notate and explain any services that are available to your private sector customers, but are not currently available to the Federal government, and explain why.<br />c.	Please describe to what degree your PaaS offerings are able to run on other provider's infrastructure.  In answering this question, identify which offerings are vendor agnostic for infrastructure and also identify which offerings are limited to certain infrastructure providers.  <br />i.	For cloud service providers that support third party PaaS offerings, describe what kind of pricing and billing structures are available.  Describe how your third party marketplace works and explain whether the third party offerings are typically ordered from the cloud service provider directly or from the third party provider.  Describe how clients are able to direct which third party offerings to incorporate into the marketplace.<br />d.	Please describe how your IaaS/PaaS offerings provide for the security of information, including threat detection, mitigation, and containment.<br />e.	Please describe your failover and data replication architecture and service offerings. How would you handle a requirement for resiliency/reliability for a solution at the tactical edge or a hybrid commercial/on-premise solution?<br />f.	How do your offerings provide for sharing of data across network boundaries, including up classification levels and outside of your IaaS/PaaS services (across other cloud provider's environments)?<br />3.	What information or attributes are required for you to accurately provide pricing information on a fixed-price basis for worldwide DoD IaaS/PaaS at all classification levels?  <br />4.	Do you have established discount methodologies, e.g., discount percentages based on reserving virtual instances?  If so, please describe.</p>
<p>III. Tactical Edge<br />1.	Please describe if and how you could provide IaaS/PaaS in austere and connectivity/communication deprived environments.  Explain and diagram the infrastructure architecture in detail, including the use of ruggedized, portable equipment that could be forward deployed and moved within hours of notice.<br />a.	If you have existing customers using such services, please describe and provide point of contact information, if possible.<br />2.	Please describe if and how you could extend IaaS/PaaS into a closed loop network where contractors may not be permitted to manage the facilities.<br />3.	Please describe your hybrid commercial and/or on-premise solution and architecture.  How would you handle an installation at the edge of connectivity, including service initiation and eventual syncing back to installations in garrison?</p>
<p>IV.  Existing Cloud Presence<br />1.	Please describe your current cloud presence in the Federal government for workloads that are classified at Secret or above, if any.  For instance, which agency, describe the technology solution, explain if the cloud services are limited to a specific geographic region, explain who maintains the facility and computing infrastructure, etc.  Do not provide any classified information in this response.<br />2.	Please describe your current on premise private cloud presence in the Federal government, if any.  For instance, which agency, describe the technology solution, describe any limitations in achieving technical parity with commercial cloud, identify the classification level, explain who maintains the facility and computing infrastructure, etc.  Do not provide any classified information in this response.<br />3.	Please describe at least one example of a large commercial customer with worldwide presence that has migrated to your infrastructure and platform services and provide point of contact information, if possible.</p>
<p>V.  Policy and Regulatory Barriers<br />1.	Please identify any policies or federal regulations that are barriers to success, explain why those policies or regulations are barriers, and propose revisions or an alternative that still achieves the underlying policy or regulatory objective.  Specific suggestions with proposed language revisions are preferred rather than more generalized comments.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) invites industry to submit a response to this Request for Information (RFI) to assist NASA in the acquisition planning for the production of the Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage (CS) and Exploration Upper Stage (EUS).
<p><br />The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy development and to assess feasibility of competition by allowing industry to identify data needed to facilitate competition, potential barriers to competition, transition risk, and Government resources needed to ensure lowest possible cost and effective transition to support the planned launch manifest. This RFI will also allow industry to express interest in competing in the contemplated acquisition and provide suggested contract type(s) and incentive structure(s) for the Government's consideration.</p>
<p>NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution basis. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. The information received will not be released in its submitted form, but may be used in developing the best approach for fulfilling these requirements, and therefore may be recognizable to the interested party.</p>
<p>Upon receiving and reviewing responses to this RFI, NASA may choose to post a subsequent revision to this RFI to request further information from industry to support NASA's acquisition planning for the contemplated procurement.</p>
<p>This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. A determination by the Government to procure this requirement based upon responses to this notice or other market research is solely within the discretion of the Government. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information of Solicitation for Planning Purposes. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of responses to this RFI.

<CONTACT>Andrew T. Rothstein, Senior Acquisition Consultant, Email RothsteinAT@state.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for the US Department of State
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued as market research to determine the potential products and Offerors for subscriber radios and associated equipment for the US Department of State (DOS), Radio Programs Branch (RPB). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse any costs associated with the preparation of responses. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this RFI will assist DOS in determining the potential level of interest, competition adequacy, and technical capabilities of potential Offerors for the required products and services. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The RPB Radio Programs are congressionally mandated (Diplomatic Security &amp; Anti-terrorism Act of 1986) and consist of four programs: Domestic Radio Operations (DRO), Washington Area Radio Network (WARN), High Frequency (HF) and Overseas Emergency &amp; Evacuation (E&amp;E).</p>
<p>IRM's Overseas Radio Program provides radio communication capability to Department of State direct-hire American employees at United States missions abroad by maintaining E&amp;E radio networks. As radio networks age and become obsolete, RPB replaces them and provides repair and return services.</p>
<p>The Global Repair and Replacement Program (GRRP) is a 10-year, life cycle replacement program for the E&amp;E radio program at overseas posts. The GRRP replaces all E&amp;E subscriber radios (handhelds, mobiles, base stations) and repeater systems used to provide the E&amp;E radio service. With 280 total posts around the world, RPB performs either replacements or updates at a rate of approximately 28 posts a year.</p>
<p>The E&amp;E radio program is made up of two channels: the E&amp;E channel, which is unencrypted, and the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) channel, which is encrypted. RPB provides all DOS personnel a radio with the E&amp;E channel. If a person is on the EAC at post, he/she will get an encryption capable radio with the additional EAC channel. As part of the E&amp;E radio program, RPB also provides post with a base station radio in the three strategic post locations.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: The Government requires potential Contractor(s) to provide Land Mobile Radio (LMR) subscriber equipment that meets the technical specifications listed below and to provide the ancillary services described in this RFI. <br />1. Technical Specifications</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are issuing this joint Request for Information (RFI) to obtain responses from private sector entities, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and other interested parties on innovative, pre-commercial or early commercial (defined below) building technologies that can cost-effectively transform the operational efficiency of federal and commercial buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Responses to this RFI will be evaluated and considered for inclusion in the GSA Proving Ground (GPG) program or the DOE High Impact Technology Innovation Catalyst (HIT Catalyst), or both. The performance of technologies selected for either or both of these programs will be evaluated in occupied, operational buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Throughout this document, the word "technology" refers broadly to integrated systems based on any combination of hardware (equipment), software (processing), materials engineering processes, and resource management devices, methods, tools, or models based on scientific or engineering principles. Technologies appropriate for measurement and verification (M&amp;V) performance studies must be either "pre-commercial," defined as<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>technology that is not yet fully available on the open market and has a value proposition or price that is still being defined, or "early commercial," defined as technology whose<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>value and risks are understood by specialists for some applications but the supply chain and/or full-scale production have not yet been fully established. Commercial technologies already broadly in use and readily available in the marketplace are not appropriate candidates for the GPG or the HIT Catalyst M&amp;V performance studies.<br />&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Overview of Fiscal Year 2018 Technology Categories:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">GSA and DOE are requesting information about innovative, transformational pre-commercial or early commercial building technologies that have the potential to: (1) optimize operating costs, (2) reduce energy consumption or offer process improvements, or both, for federally and privately owned commercial buildings and (3) provide, through an M&amp;V performance study, evidence-based information needed to validate the technical and operational characteristics of the technology and its potential for future deployment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Technologies submitted must apply to one or both of the following two categories: </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br /><br />1. Behind-the-Meter Load Optimization</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">: Technologies that optimize behind-the-meter generation, building loads, storage, or any combination of these, to provide resiliency, energy efficiency, or enable participation in dynamic rate structures, or any combination thereof. Technologies may be applicable to individual buildings or campuses, or both.</span></p>
<p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;2. </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Improving Overall Building Operations and Maintenance</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">: Technologies that either help operators better understand when buildings are not functioning within operational or design parameters, or dynamically correct these faults without operator intervention. This may include tools that enable the identification, prioritization, and improvement of physical building components or software systems, or both.<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>(Any Smart Energy Analytics platforms submitted should integrate and enhance the functionality of GSA Link, which is built on the SkyFoundry program.)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 RFI focuses exclusively on the two categories listed above. If your technology does not fall into one or both of the above categories, please check back next year for a new set of categories.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">How to Submit a Response:</span></strong></p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2017 to November 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

It will not result in any award of contract and no remuneration will be forthcoming for the preparation of a response to this Sources Sought.<br />General: This Sources Sought follows on previous market research used to study the feasibility of consolidating USACE archaeological collections within the Mississippi Valley Division (W912P914X0007 July 2014). The work covered by this Sources Sought may include housing, stabilizing, rehabilitating, preserving, transporting, and providing collections management services and access to archaeological materials and associated records (hereafter archaeological collections) generated in conjunction with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers activities throughout the continental United States (CONUS). 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 79-Curation of Federally-Owned and Administered Archeological Collections (Enclosure 1)-states in 79.6(b)(1), that, "When possible, the collection should be deposited in a repository that...(ii) Stores and maintains other collections from the same site or project location; or (iii) Houses collections from a similar geographic region or cultural area." Additionally, 36 CFR 79.6(b)(2) recommends that collections "should not be subdivided and stored at more than a single repository unless such subdivision is necessary to meet special storage, conservation, or research needs." Finally, the two components of these collections-archaeological materials and associated records-"should be deposited in the same repository to maintain the integrity and research value of the collection." Except in those instances where non-federally owned archaeological collections are retained and disposed of by the owner [36 CFR 79.6(b)(3)]. USACE will curate its archaeological collections across the CONUS. <br />Facilities/Repositories interested in housing USACE's collections should have the capacity to store between 700 and 800 cubic feet of USACE archaeological materials and up to 150 linear feet of records, and meet the standards set forth in 36 CFR 79.9. The facilities/repositories interested must accept collections from any state within a geographic region or cultural area and must accept collections that include Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) defined human skeletal materials and cultural objects. The facilities/repositories must accept collections that may not, upon delivery, meet the repositories' curation standards. Additionally, facilities/repositories should have a demonstrated ability to foster public access and outreach programs that promote education and research and must be able to permit access as appropriate for religious use consistent with 36 CFR 79.10.<br />Typical Work: Typical work includes, but is not limited to the following: (1) maintaining an archaeological collections management center that provides for the long-term curation of USACE archaeological collections in accordance with 36 CFR 79.9 and USACE Engineering Regulation/Engineering Pamphlet (ER/EP) 1130-2-540; (2) arranging for the loan or display of all or part of a collection upon request of agencies, organizations, institutions, or individuals having adequate facilities for study or display; (3) ensuring that curatorial services furnished pursuant to this scope of work conform to the standards in 36 CFR 79 and ER/EP 1130-2-540; (4) maintaining a digital collections management retrieval system that will permit USACE and other qualified individuals and institutions access for study, loan, education, or public interpretation of USACE collections; (5) accepting one-time accessioning/processing fees (which are separate from annual curation services costs) from other investigating organizations or contractors that are depositing archaeological collections recovered from USACE fee-title lands; (6) upgrading or rehabilitating USACE archaeological collections, as necessary, conducting an annual inspection of all USACE collections (artifacts and records) and preparing a report that evaluates the condition of each collection in accordance with 36 CFR 79.11 and ER/EP 1130-2-540; (7) and maintaining a curatorial staff that includes Qualified Museum Professionals as described in 36 CFR 79.4(b)(h). The repositories/facilities shall not publicly display NAGPRA defined Native American human skeletal remains, associated and unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony from any USACE collections, nor shall they research, photograph, or publish any such collections protected under NAGPRA without prior written permission from the USACE. The repositories/facilities shall not alter, dispose of, or transfer any USACE archaeological collections without prior written permission from USACE.<br />Work Period: The facilities/repositories shall be available for typical operations utilizing an 8-hour work day during daylight hours Monday through Friday. Archaeological collections will be appropriately secured and monitored during non-work hours. The contract duration shall be one Base Year with four Option Years to be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.<br />Contract Areas and Construction Limits: The primary contract areas fall within CONUS.<br />Required Trades: The facilities/repositories shall have the capabilities of supplying trades including, but not limited to curators, collections managers, conservators, archivists, electronic records managers, archaeologists (including historic archaeologists), archaeological technicians, physical anthropologists, and other professional staff.<br />Required Equipment: No specific equipment is required of the facilities/repositories; however, as specified in 36 CFR 79.9(2), the facilities/repositories must be able to "dedicate the requisite facilities, equipment, and space to properly store, study and conserve the collection. Space used for storage, study, conservation, and, if exhibited, any exhibition must not be used for non-curatorial purposes that would endanger or damage the collection." Additionally, the facilities/repositories must "keep the collection under physically secure conditions within storage, laboratory, study and any exhibition areas" [see 36 CFR 79.9(3)].<br />Responders to this Sources Sought should submit a five to ten page narrative that outlines facility/repository capabilities including:<br />1. Current available space for archaeological collections. Future plans for expansion including timeline. Provide data in cubic, linear, or square feet to describe storage dimensions.<br />2. A demonstrated ability to maintain an archaeological collections management center that will provide for the long-term curation of archaeological collections in accordance with 36 CFR 79.9 and ER/EP 1130-2-540 (images may be included as supporting evidence).<br />3. A demonstrated ability to arrange for the loan or display of all or part of a collection upon request of agencies, organizations, institutions, or individuals having adequate facilities for study or display (a description of loan arrangements with others will suffice).<br />4. Maintenance of a digital collections management retrieval system that will permit USACE and other qualified individuals and institutions access for study, loan, education, or public interpretation of collections.<br />5. Information regarding fee schedules for one-time accessioning/processing fees (which are separate from annual curation services costs).<br />6. The current per box/per cubic foot cost for one year of maintenance (annual curation services costs) of artifact collections and the per linear foot costs of one year of maintenance of records collections.<br />7. Information regarding upgrade or rehabilitation schedules for archaeological collections, including discussion of how annual inspections and preparation of a report that evaluates the condition of each archaeological collection in accordance with 36 CFR 79.11 and ER/EP 1130-2-540 will be undertaken.<br />8. Information regarding the professional curatorial staff that includes Qualified Museum Professionals as described in 36 CFR 79.4(b)(h).<br />9. Either a copy of, or a reference to, the web location of the facility/repository guidelines. These guidelines may be attached to the ten page narrative and do not count against the page limit.<br />

SCOPE: 

The scope of this effort falls in line with VA s mission, goals, and objectives in support of providing Veterans  care. Gaseous Plasma Sterilization (also known as Sterilizing Units) Units are designed for total inactivation of microorganisms that are or may be present on medical devices using vapors or gases in plasma state, a form of matter that includes electrons and positive ions usually resulting from the application of a strong electromagnetic (e.g., radio frequency) field. These units usually include a treatment (frequently vacuum) chamber with shelves on which the devices to be sterilized are placed, usually after being cleaned of gross debris and then packed; means to introduce the vapor (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, H2O2) into the chamber; electrodes that are activated to convert the vapor to plasma; a radio-frequency generator; and controls to start/stop automated cycles of the procedure. After the sterilization cycle is complete an integral evacuation system to eliminate the residues (water and oxygen when using H2O2) is usually activated. Plasma sterilizing units are available in a variety of shapes and sizes in both stand-alone (bulk) and tabletop models; they are used for devices and supplies that are sensitive to high temperature and humidity (e.g., devices and supplies that include plastic and/or rubber components).  Sterilizing Units are used to sterilize a wide range of instruments efficiently, with no toxic residues.

This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the offeror indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product. For each equal product, the offeror must include a description reflecting the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the equal product(s) specified in the solicitation. The offeror also must clearly identify the item by brand name (if any) and make/model number. Finally, the offeror must include descriptive literature, such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the contracting officer, and clearly describe any modifications it plans to make to a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.
 
See attachment for Contract Line Item Numbers along with Salient Characteristics, P/N and description which will be in the proposed solicitation. 

DISCLAIMERS: 

The VA will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to: 

1) Provide the commodity consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 

2) Secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 

3) Implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with delivery schedules; and meeting the rigid listed specifications.

<RESPDATE>112117
<CONTACT>Andrea C. Lovell, Contracting Officer, Phone 6506041064, Email andrea.c.lovell@nasa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Suborbital Flight Testing and Flight Experiments with CubeSat Payloads<br /> <br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is requesting broad community input under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine interest in using high altitude aircraft as a means for flight testing CubeSat form factor science payloads.  This RFI is for information purposes only.
<p>The NASA Airborne Science Program (ASP), managed under the Earth Science Division (ESD) within the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), operates a fleet of highly modified aircraft that support NASA satellite missions, technology development, and science investigations.  The primary objectives of the program include supporting satellite calibration and validation, new sensor development, process studies of the Earth system, and developing the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Additional information on the ASP can be found at: https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/.</p>
<p>The ER-2 is one of the ASP aircrafts that has significant capacity to support CubeSat form factor payloads, with four large pressurized payload areas with view ports made of glass or quartz and high altitude flight profiles. Instruments may also be exposed to the unpressurized environment for air sampling.  Specific characteristics of the ER-2 platform include:<br />&middot;           20,000 feet to 70,000 feet operational altitude<br />&middot;           410 knots cruise speed<br />&middot;           3,000 nautical miles to 6000 nautical miles range<br />&middot;           8-hour flight time (7-hours at altitude) to 10 hours (9-hours at altitude)<br />&middot;           High capacity AC/DC electrical system</p>
<p>A science payload may include a remote sensing device, an onboard biological experiment, or subsystems that support computing or communications. The two primary use cases of interest are flight testing CubeSat instruments intended for orbital use and flight experiments that leverage CubeSat components and technologies to reduce the mass and volume of earth observing instruments and subsystems for both aircraft and spacecraft.</p>
<p>NASA is seeking input from the science and technology community regarding CubeSat instruments and experiments that would benefit from flight testing on aircraft. As an example, these experiments may utilize one or more ER-2 payload areas for one or more flight missions to perform Earth science experiments, experiments for electronic sensor research and development, or satellite calibration and validation.</p>
<p>Experiments that address any of the following are welcomed: space sciences, atmospheric sciences, bio-spheric sciences, carbon modeling, ecosystems and the environment, or societal applications (e.g., forest fire monitoring).<br />ARC is seeking responses from all interested parties, including but not limited to, educational, industrial, and not-for-profit organizations.  Responses to this RFI should include the following:<br />&bull;	Name and address of the firm,<br />&bull;	Cage Code and DUNS Number (if applicable)<br />&bull;	Point(s) of contact names, phone numbers, and email address(es)<br />&bull;	Statements that provide a brief description of the CubeSat instrument(s), the current technology readiness level and the rationale, and objective of the proposed experiments.  The statements should also describe the payload mass, power, and volume requirements, as well as the desired flight duration, desired schedule of flight testing, and any other special integration needs. <br />Interested parties are requested to submit their response to this RFI, via email only, to Contracting Officer, Andrea Lovell at email: andrea.c.lovell@nasa.gov, by 3:00 p.m. PT, on the stated response date.   Submissions should be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat software applications. Statements should be no more than 10 pages (no less than 12 point Times New Roman font except in figure captions).  When responding, reference "80ARC-018-RFI-ALA001 - Suborbital Flight Testing and Flight Experiments with CubeSat Payloads".</p>
<p>Following the review of the statements of interest, NASA may conduct one-on-one meetings with respondents to facilitate further exchanges of information.</p>
<p>This RFI is only for determining interest in using high altitude aircraft as a means for flight testing CubeSat form factor science payloads.  This RFI is subject to review or cancellation at any time and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract or agreement. The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this request and respondents will not be notified of the results.  This announcement does not constitute a Request for Proposal. Please do not request for a copy of the solicitation, as no solicitation exists at this time.</p>
<p>Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC.</p>

It enables provision of a near-real combat learning experience in a controlled training environment that approaches the reality of the complex and challenging contemporary operating environment to include Direct Action training events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This expansion of network coverage and of the fiber networks is necessary to allow near real time bi-directional instrumented digital data transfer from the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement Systems (MILES) sensor equipment on Soldiers, vehicles and Observer-Coach/Trainer mobile voice and data connections from locations within the JRTC LE area to the Core Instrumentation Subsystem (CIS) located in building 1560 (JRTC Joint Operations Center).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will enable the delivery of task-based, battle-focused, objective, and actionable feedback to leaders and units.<br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: "><br />The Government has purchased 45,000 acres, known as the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: ">JRTC Land Expansion area, in which the Government is looking to instrument these acres as part of the current JRTC training area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: ">The current JRTC training area is approximately 198,125 acres, of which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: ">100,000&nbsp;acres are owned by the Department of the Army and 98,125&nbsp;acres owned by the U.S. Forest Service, mostly in the Kisatchie National Forest. The land expansion will create a new total training area of 243,125 acres. <br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to increase the geographical operating area of the JRTC-IS. This effort will provide instrumentation system (IS) coverage of the area commonly known as the Joint Readiness Training Center Land Expansion (JRTC-LE). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It is recognized by the Government that the Range Communication System (RCS) implementation at the JRTC is based on the use of the current commercial cellular network (AT&amp;T) is a proprietary system currently in use. The JRTC RCS system infrastructure is currently being installed with a final fielding of the JRTC RCS data of FY19. The Government's intent is to build upon the existing JRTC-IS RCS effort as the base for the expansion of data collection capabilities for the JRTC LE area. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The focus area for this JRTC-LE effort will be comprised solely of:<br /><br /><br />- Combat Trainer Data subsystems of the RCS in support of the RCS tablets and Player Units;<br />- Cellular Towers and Shelters; and<br />- Fiber Optic Network (FON)</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><br />The Government's position is that due to AT&amp;T being the prime Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the commercial cellular network equipment used for the JRTC RCS program for Combat Trainer Data subsystems and prime subcontractor under the RCS program for the installation of the cellular towers, shelters, and FON, any other contractor awarded this effort would be required to utilize AT&amp;T as a subcontractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, due to AT&amp;T proprietary cellular network equipment and because the JRTC RSC Technical Data Package has not accepted by the Government is not feasible to provide any other contractor the necessary data in order to propose equitable proposal to the Government.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex (FCC), Butner, North Carolina, intends to issue to the current contractor a firm-fixed price, sole source purchase order to Ricoh USA, 70 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, PA 19533. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, NC for the period March 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018. The Federal Correctional Complex has a need for copier rental in the FCC Butner Medical Department. The Government has determined that Ricoh USA is the only vendor that will satisfy the agency requirements with continuing Copier rental and Maintenance services for the Medical Department. The Government has determined that switching contractors will cause undue burden on the Government. FCC Butner has determined the lack of staffing, background clearance procedures and internal logistical issues will be too burdensome for the Government to replace copiers at this time. This is not a request for competitive quotes and is a Sole Source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only. However, all information received within 15 working days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><p>NASA JSC seeks to advance technology associated with autonomous robotic construction, material handling, and assembly techniques.  We have one of the world's largest seven degree of freedom (DOF) serial manipulators that was originally used for Astronaut training for International Space Station (ISS) Assembly and has been dormant for a number of years.  This significant asset has been identified for divestment as a training facility and is available to study autonomous material handling and construction techniques.  Example tasks may include unloading cargo from a lander, positioning (assembling) elements relative to each other, loading cargo on a launcher, and construction of facilities (habitats, propellant processing, laboratories, light manufacturing, etc.). Researching methods to perform tele-operated robotics with delay tolerant communication, robotic autonomy during periods of human spacecraft or planetary habitat dormancy and intuitive human robotic interfaces are all areas to utilize the unique NASA serial manipulator.<br /><br />JSC is also interested in comparison of serial and parallel robot utility as an autonomous precursor to human settlement, evolving into human / robot collaborative environments. <br /><br />Technology:<br /><br />The JSC is working on automation and robotics aspects of the exploration architecture, which now includes a Moon-orbiting Deep Space Gateway and ultimately the exploration and utilization of the Moon and Mars.  The primary technology challenges include increasing the level of autonomy available to carry out complex tasks (construction, assembly, and material handling) with minimal human supervision.<br /><br />R&amp;D Status:<br /><br />The technology associated with the current assets are aging.  The ISS used man-in-the-loop control for assembly tasks.  Path planning and autonomy software tools have advanced since the hardware was built and operated, so upgrading the control strategy and integrating path planning and autonomy tools is the key portion of the partnership.<br /><br />Intellectual Property (IP):<br /><br />A Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner.<br /><br />This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents.<br /><br />Please submit a Statement of Interest Form,&nbsp;<a href="https://nasajsc.secure.force.com/StatementofInterest">https://nasajsc.secure.force.com/StatementofInterest</a>.<br /><br />To view all Co-Development and Partnering Opportunities with the NASA Johnson Space Center please visit our website,&nbsp;<br /><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/partnerships/JSC-Partnership-Gateway">https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/partnerships/JSC-Partnership-Gateway</a>.</p>

Question 1:  We request the government clarify how value will be evaluated in offers, or correct the best value language in the solicitation to reflect a lowest price, technically acceptable determination.

This solicitation states that bids will be evaluated on a best value basis, but then states that award will be made on the basis of the lowest price, technically acceptable bid. For example, pages 24 and 25 of current solicitation 36C10g18Q0035 read in part as follows:

A. BASIS FOR ISSUANCE OF BPA

In accordance with FAR 8.405-3(a)(7)(viii) and 8.405-3(b)(1)(ii), a best value determination will be conducted to determine the establishment of the BPA.  For items identified in the solicitation as brand-name-or-equal, the solicitation provision FAR 52.211-6 shall apply.  As such, FAR 52.211-6 requires that the Vendor s quote indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product.  In addition, for each equal product, the proposal must include a description reflecting the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of  equal  products specified in the solicitation.  The quote must also clearly identify the item by brand name (if any), and make/model number.  In addition, the proposal must include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer, and clearly describe any modifications the Offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.  Best value will be determined per line item, and one or more single-award BPAs will be established based on the Quoter who has been determined responsible, whose quote provides the lowest reasonable price and meets the Government s brand-name-or-equal requirements/salient characteristics.

A. EVALUATION APPROACH: 

FAR 52.211-6 Evaluation:
 
FAR 52.211-6 requires that products offered as  equal  undergo verification that is performed by the Contracting officer.  Specifically, FAR 52.211-6 requires the Contracting Officer to evaluate  equal  products based on information furnished by the Offeror or identified in the proposal and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The provision notes that the Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.  Upon verification, the Contracting Officer will submit the information to the Program Executive Office (PEO) for final validation prior to determining Contract award.  The BPA will be awarded to the responsible Offeror that provides the lowest price and meets the government s brand-name-or-equal requirements/salient characteristics per line item.

Answer 1:  Language does not need to be corrected.  Best value can be determined using one of two methods: lowest price, technically acceptable or tradeoff.  For this requirement, lowest price, technically acceptable is being utilized IAW FAR  15.101-2 (a)
Question 2:  We also request the government extend the response date to allow offerors time to address the value evaluation.

Answer 2.  The response due date for all solicitations have been extended until 2:00pm November 6, 2017. 

Question 3:  I have received notice of the below RFQ s that are due on Monday. Since there are so many items on each of these, is there any way to get the due date extended past 10/30?

Answer 3:  See answer 2.

Question 4:  Please advise if I can respond to only the Laboratory requirement. 

Answer 4:  You can respond to any items to which you are not restricted via any socio-economic set-aside.  All items quoted must be on your FSS contract.  All items listed under these solicitations will be added to the MSPV program.  

Question 5:  Please advise how a quotation to the VA pertains to Medical Surgical Prime Vendors program. Am I quoting the Prime Vendors?

Answer 5:  No you are not quoting the Prime Vendors. You would be quoting items list on the  Attachment B   PPD  spreadsheets.

Question 6:  I am inquiring about a conflict of information within the current RFQ that we are reviewing for submission and respectfully request your guidance.

According to Page 24  of  Section E.5 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS, VOLUME III - SOLICITATION, QUOTE AND AWARD DOCUMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS/REPRESENTATIONS of the attached document  the  instructions state the Volume shall contain.

i.            52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matter (OCT 2015).
ii.            52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (JUL 2013).
iii.            52.209-11 Representation by Corporation Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under any Federal (FEB 2016).
iv.            52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports (Feb 1999)
 v.            52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance (Apr 1984)
 vi.            Completed provision 52.212-3, Representations and Certifications or current copy from SAM.

The conflicts are noted below,

Page 17  -  E.2 52.209-5   -  Indicates a conflicting FAR description and provision statement of :  REPRESENTATION BY CORPORATIONS REGARDING AN UNPAID TAX LIABILITY OR A FELONY CONVICTION UNDER ANY FEDERAL LAW (DEVIATION)(MAR 2012) ,  we believe this FAR should be the Certification Regarding Responsibility Matter (OCT 2015) in accordance with the Acquisition.Gov (FAR) website .  The description in the document is connected to FAR 52.209-11 but outdated.

The additional conflicts are the  items requested on page 24  are not included in Section E   Solicitation Provisions.
i.            52.209-11 Representation by Corporation Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under any Federal (FEB 2016).
ii.            52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports (Feb 1999)
iii.            52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance (Apr 1984)

Can you please clarify what we are to correctly include in Volume III.

Answer 6: 52.209-5 is the correct number even though is the same as the Certification of Responsibility Matter because it s a (Deviation)
52.209-11, 52.222-22, 52.222-25-These are included and are part of your SAM certification and can be provided as such.

Question 7:  Please confirm that offerors arenotrequired to propose pricing or submit an offer for each line item included in the Attachment B Product and Pricing Document.

Answer 7:  Not required, your company will propose whatever items it can propose under the requirements of the solicitation.  

Question 8:  If offerors elect not to bid a certain line item, should they leave that item blank or insert  NA  or some other designation?

Answer 8:  Leave Blank, quote only the interested items.

Question 9:  If an awarded item becomes obsolete during the five year term of the BPA, is the only recourse to cancel that items or may the new version of the product be thereafter sold at the BPA price?

Answer 9:  To be determined at discretion of program office with CO approval.

Question 10: The BPA states at page 4 that the BPA may be cancelled by either party upon 90 days written notice. What if the contractor desires to cancel one item on the BPA but not other items? Must a cancellation extend to the entire BPA?

Answer 10:  No, items can be removed individually.

Question 11:  The requirement to offer 5 year pricing for every offered line item is problematic as it subjects the offeror to a high degree of risk that the price can be maintained over the entire 5 year term. That further suggest that individual line item cancellations need to permitted. Otherwise offerors will have to cancel their entire BPA if the pricing of certain items becomes too risky in later years. Please advise is this is possible?

Answer 11: See Answer 10.

Question 12:  If line item cancellations by the contractor are not permitted, then under FAR 16.203 some form of economic price adjustment in the future years is warranted, otherwise too much risk is placed on the offeror. In that event, we would suggest that the economic price adjustment should be tied to an established price, namely the offeror s current FSS price. If the FSS price goes up or down, then BPA price (based on its discount relationship to the FSS price) should be adjusted accordingly. Then the risk to both parties is mitigated.

Answer 12:  See Answer 10.

Question 13:  What is the basis for inserting FAR 52.227-14, Right in Data in the RFQ? There are no data item deliverables under the resulting contract. Also, products to be offered are commercial items which presumes that the Government will have no rights in the offeror s/manufacturer s commercial data. Finally the clause places the burden on the contractor to withhold any data to which the Government is entitled to only limited rights or submit that data to the Government with appropriate markings. This is not the normal practice in the industry. Given the decentralized nature of ordering an delivery under the contract, the contractor should not be placed in a position of waiving intellectual property rights in data that is provided to assist the customer. Request that this clause be deleted or its purpose further explained.

Answer 13:  The clause is required; however, if no data item is to be included then this is not applicable. This will be for tracking data and manufacturing data, but not product data other than where it is manufactured.

Question 14:  Do we need to submit our reply via email and the ebuy site?

Answer 14:  Please refer  E.5 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS  for procedures of quote submissions.

Question 15:  The following statement appears under Section E.5, Instructions To Offerors, Section B, Quote Submission:   Offerors shall be a VA FSS holder for Schedule 65 and/or 66 by the date and time for receipt of offers/quotations .  But, the solicitations do not specifically state that items included in offers have to be listed on that vendors FSS contract.  Please confirm that SAC will only be accepting offers for products that are listed on Offerors FSS contracts. 

Answer 15:  Correct. Only items on FSS, a vendors FSS contract, that the vendor is a distributor for can be offered.  No open market items should be included for this requirement.

Question 16:  These solicitations include both the Buy American Certificate and Trade Agreements Certificate.  Both of these certificates apply only if the Buy American Act Clause 52.225-1 and the Trade Agreements Act Clause 52.225-5 are included in the solicitation.  I could not find either clause in these solicitations.  Were these two clauses left out inadvertently?  Please clarify.

Answer 16:  The BAA and TAA clause are part of the your FSS contract and they apply. The RFQ s utilizes those clauses in combination with the current ones. BAA will apply to the set-asides while TAA apply to non set-asides.

Question 17:  We are having trouble with the spreadsheet for RFQ1248381.  Seems column M in tab 3 won t allow us to make an entry.  Can you please advise Column M can only accept numerical values.

Answer 17:  A corrected spreadsheet has been uploaded resolving the issue. Modification replaces original Attachment B - PPD with corrected version, to resolve a data entry issue that prevented information from being input into Column "M" under Tab "3 Pricing".

Question 18:  I have a couple of questions regarding RFQ1248381.  I am confused as to how this relates to the pre solicitation notice I received from FedBizOpps last week.  Solicitation #36C10G18R0045. Both of these pertain to advanced wound care through the MSPV program.  Can you please explain what the difference between the two are and how they impact the Mfg of wound care dressings

Answer 18:  The pre-solicitation notice that you mentioned is for another set of requirements under the MSPV program, not this requirement (RFQ1248381).  Each requirement is for a separate list of items.  There isn t any impact to the Mfg of wound care dressings.  In order to compete for the items listed on the subject RFQ, you will have to provide quote.  In order to compete for the items associated with the pre-solicitation notice that you mentioned in your email, you will have to provide a quote to that RFQ/RFP when it is released.

Question 19:  Can I still bid with a TAA compliant item if I don t yet have it on GSA/VA FSS? (I do have a GSA/FSS V797D-50450)

If yes to question 1, then how will the VA require shipping?  Drop ship to one central location for distribution?  Or drop ship to individual VA MCs throughout the US/HI/PR etc?

Answer 19:  All quoted items must be on your company s FSS.  No open market or non-FSS items will be accepted for these requirements.  

Shipment for items would be made to the distributors identified in attachment A.

Question 20:  For RFQ1248462 is there only one item listed for this request?  
Are some products only being sent to SDVWO companies?  that received a request for a drain bag but I did not receive a request for a drain bag.

Answer 20:  Please review all  Attachment B   PPDs  spreadsheets for all items associated with each solicitation. Your company received notification of this solicitation because your company is listed under one of the SINs chosen at the time of this solicitation s release.  Please contact GSA administrators to verify as to what and how your company will receive additional notifications.  Some solicitations will be set-aside for certain socio-economic business categories, i.e. SDVOSBs while others will be unrestricted.  

Question 21:  I wanted to confirm that when responding to RFQ1248462 products in all 4 SIN categories should be submitted on one document correct?   
Answer 21:  The additional SINs were added to provide greater visibility on GSA.  In responding yourc company only has to provide back one solicitation package but will have to provide back separate individual spreadsheets for each category of items that your company quotes on, i.e.  apparel and textile ,  Syringes and Needles ,  Patient Care , etc.  Do not combine the spreadsheets.

Question 22;  We do not see a Cascading Order of Preference ("COP") on this RFQ.  Was the COP left out intentionally?  

If this is an open market RFQ, is there another RFQ with a COP for the same materials?  

Answer 22:  Correct, cascading is not a part of this acquisition.

Question 23:  We request further clarification on this subject. As we are a verified SDVOSB supplier of this brand name item, and it is BAA compliant, we believe this item (and other items like it) should be procured under the SDVOSB set aside procurement.  Thank you.

Answer 23:  These items were identified to be made outside of the US. If you have different information please provide that information to us.  Per the note under the  Definitions Instructions  tab of the  Attachment B   PPD  spreadsheets, on the row regarding  OEM Part's Country of Origin  it is state that  The default for this field is USA.  Please change as needed.  It does not mean that that is the predetermined country of origin.  

Question 24:  Can we obtain more detail on some item numbers: 10003 through 10013?

Answer 24:  There aren t any additional details to provide regarding the items you identified.  The requirement is a brand name or equal acquisition.  The spreadsheet provides the Product Name/ Description, the MFG/MFG (Product) Brand Name /MFG Part #, and the necessary salient characteristics for quoting an or equal item.

Question 25:  This email is in regard to the eBuy RFQ ID: RFQ1248400 MSPV Central Supply (EMS, Orthopedics and Safety Devices) Unrestricted in which you are listed as the Contracting Officer. We have the following questions in which are needing clarification on:
Why is this solicitation not an SDVOSB set-aside? Was Market Research adequately conducted for this RFQ? 
  
Answer 25:  The solicitation is not an SDVOSB set-aside as items under a set-aside need to be BAA compliant.  In light of this, we had to utilize an unrestricted acquisition to properly comply with Trade Agreements Act.  See Answer 23 as well.


Question 26:  Must SDVOSB respondents already (currently) have a GSA or FSS contract in order to reply to these RFQs?
Answer 26:  Yes, that is the case for these RFQ s.
Question 27:  Can you please confirm if this solicitation is only for "GSA registered" companies, or can any vendor (that meets either SBA or Unrestricted, as categorized), submit a quote?
Answer 27:  It s an FSS requirement; therefore your items have to be in schedule.
Question 28:  The items I sell are on the FSS but I don' t hold the schedule the Prime does. Do that nake me eligible to sell those items on the schedule?
Answer 28:  You need to have an FSS contract to be able to provide these. Hope this helps clarify
Question 29:  We are a (SDVOSB) company.  On Solicitation # 36C10G18Q0013, we can provide the majority of supplies needed for this bid.  There are only 3 or 4 items we cannot provide.  Can we bid on what we can provide?  And I need clarification on the Respiratory Theory.  Do you just need the device for the Respiratory Theory?  
Answer 29:  Yes, please follow the RFQ instructions and submit quotes for the items you can provide via FSS. You will have to be more specific on your second question about the Respiratory Therapy RFQ.
Question 30:  GSA E Buy will not accept the data that VA requires in a bid submittal, to large!!
Answer 30:  Each of the spreadsheets (see example attached) contain: Product Name, Brand Name, Part number and salient characteristics. The RFQ s contain instructions on how to 
Question 31.  It appears that the below listed sections are missing on the solicitation booklet. This is part of the requirement under Volume 3: Solicitation, Quote and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations.
 
i. 52.209-11 Representation by Corporation Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under any Federal (FEB 2016).
ii. 52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports (Feb 1999)
iii. 52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance (Apr 1984)

Answer 31. Seen answer to Question # 6.

We expect interested vendors to be able to provide a capabilities statement and prior performance examples based on the requirements spelled out in the draft PWS.Therefore, we will not be including the attachments with the RFI; but will be including them once a formal RFP is issued.

For some reason, when the spreadsheet is first opened, it begins at Column  D . But if you scroll to the left, you can see Columns A-C, as well. That is where the IDES volumes are located.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p><strong>Consolidated <br />Facilities Management Service</strong></p>
<p><br />This solicitation contains a Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) work statement for a performance-based service.  The CFM approach combines facilities related contracts into a single contract designed to reduce administrative costs and simplify the management of various building services.  The performance-based service means that the Government has described WHAT is to be accomplished, NOT HOW to accomplish it, and states a basis for determining whether finished work meets the Government quality requirements.  It does not state detailed procedures for accomplishing the work unless there are safety, security or communication requirements.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that they build into their bid/proposal price, the necessary hours that it will take to meet the performance standards specified.  The Contractor will be required to maintain a quality control program to ensure that the requirements of this contract are met.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the management, administrative, supervision, labor, sub-contractors, materials, supplies and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of Preventive Maintenance services, repair of building operating equipment and systems as described in this contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for needed engineering services and reimbursable building alterations of building equipment including, but not limited to:  All elevators on the premises, custodial and trash/debris removal services and all miscellaneous work associated with complete building facility management at the building.  The Contractor will determine how much labor is needed to perform the tasks, what methods will be used to complete the job and which supplies, materials and equipment are needed.</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>CODE IDENTIFICATION AND PROJECT TITLE: 2017-21007A: Waste Lube Oil (WLO) Collection and Re-refining Project Feasibility Study</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study ("Study") in support of a waste lube oil ("WLO") collection and re-refining project.  The objective of the Study is to evaluate the establishment of an integrated chain of operations for gathering WLO, re-refining and marketing the base oils.  This includes determining the best technology solutions; substantiating the economic, technical, environmental, commercial and financial viability of the project; assessing the regulatory framework and making recommendations for possible changes that could increase the efficiency of the market; and evaluating different collection mediums and sources for collecting, storing and transporting WLO from sources to the re-refining facility(ies).</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA") is providing a grant to ElSewedy Electric S.A.E. (the "Grantee") for a feasibility study (the "Study") that will assist the Grantee in evaluating the technical, regulatory and financial viability of a proposed waste lube oil ("WLO") collection and re-refining project ("Project") in Egypt ("Host Country").</p>
<p>Currently, Egypt consumes approximately 650,000 metric tons ("MT") of lubricants per year.  However, it is estimated that only a small percentage is collected and re-refined.  The objective of the Study is to evaluate the establishment of an integrated chain of operations for gathering WLO, re-refining and marketing the base oils.  This includes determining the best technology solutions; substantiating the economic and financial viability of the project; assessing the regulatory framework and making recommendations for possible changes that could increase the efficiency of the market; and evaluating different collection mediums and sources for collecting, storing and transporting WLO from sources to the re-refining facility(ies).</p>
<p>One of the critical aspects of the Study will be to assess the amount of available WLO feedstock in order for the Grantee to make an informed decision to commission the construction of the first re-refining facility, which would have a capacity to produce up to +/-30,000 MT of re-refined lubricating oil per year.  Over time, as additional feedstock becomes increasingly available, the Grantee will seek to scale up and expand its operations through the construction of two additional re-refining facilities, which would have a total capacity to produce up to 90,000 MT of re-refined lubricating oil per year. The grantee may also decide to expand its collection infrastructure to be larger than the re-refining capacity of the plants to have an option to sell the excess WLO to other facilitites/companies locally or internationaly.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Cairo, the Grantee, ElSewedy Electric S.A.E. established its operation as a family-owned electrical equipment trading company in 1938.  It expanded its operations over the following decades, primarily in the energy sector.  Since then, Elsewedy has grown to a fully integrated energy solutions provider with operations predominately in North Africa, the Middle East and in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $762,902 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM LOCAL TIME (Cairo, Egypt), December 15, 2017</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Please confirm in your proposal that your company is able to submit electronic invoices as set forth in the clause.<br /><br />REGARDING ACCESS TO AIR FORCE FACILITIES AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS</p>
<p>(a) Contractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology (IT) networks in connection with the work on this contract must be U.S. citizens. For the purpose of base and network access, possession of a permanent resident card ("Green Card") does not equate to U.S. citizenship. This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments. Any waivers to this requirement must be granted in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to providing access. The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC).</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) above, if an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system. If an IT network/system requires an U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system; AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications; consistent with the requirements above: (1) Contractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under this contract/order; or (2) Contractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.</p>
<p>In addition to the federal holidays identified in the Performance Work Statement, the AFRL Site Director may limit access due to other circumstances. These events may include such things as inclement weather conditions, power outages, unscheduled federal closures and/or other unexpected emergency situations.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency situation, the Director will announce through public channels either delayed reporting or closure of RRS facilities due to emergency conditions. This announcement is made solely for safety and security purposes and to inform all personnel (Government and Contractor) of site closure/delayed reporting. The Director is not authorizing time off for contractor employees and is not authorizing payment for work not performed. The Contractor shall take all appropriate actions to notify their employees of closure/delayed reporting and make alternate work/schedule arrangements, if necessary.</p>
<p>Facilities may remain open for contractor personnel during unscheduled federal closures (e.g., National Day of Mourning) or other instances where Government employees are granted administrative leave in non-emergency situations.<br /><br />All responsible organizations may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>A revised Attachment D - Price Evaluation Template has been posted. The revised Attachment includes the following changes:<br /><br />-Reference to the solicitation number has been corrected.<br />-A cell for "Grand Total" that automatically calculates the sum of the base and option year prices has been added.<br /><br />TSA received an additional question in regards to this solicitation&nbsp;and is providing the following response:<br /><br />Question: Response to Q. 110 in the TSEMD Questions and Responses document seems to indicate that a COOP is not required for the RFP since the solution will be on TSA's network. However, Section C.7.7 of the Solicitation seems to require a COOP. Can you please confirm if a COOP is required to be provided in the technical approach?</p>
<p>Response: The response provided to Question 110 in the Questions and Responses document specifically indicates that "Offeror is not required to provide a method to back-up the data." A COOP plan is still required in accordance with Section C.7.7 of the SOW; however, the associated deliverable (A005) is not part of the technical approach.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor&rsquo;s judgment (impaired objectivity OCI);</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">-Preventing unfair competitive advantage that might arise as a result of unequal access to information such as non-public competitively useful information, proprietary information of another contractor, or Source Selection Information (unequal access to information);</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">For each OCI concern identified, the Offeror is encouraged to submit its avoidance, neutralization and/or </span><span style="color: black;">mitigation strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Offerors should submit this analysis and its OCI strategies (not exceeding 12 pages) via e-mail to the Contracting Officer by September 5, 2017. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The goal is to provide proactive feedback on OCI-related issues before the issuance of the Final Request for Proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is optional and Offerors will not be considered ineligible for award solely because the Offeror declines to participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office Submarines (PEO SUB) seeks identify possible sources to fulfill the requirements of the AN/BPS-17(V)1 RADAR system for maintenance for installed AN/BPS17(V)1 RADAR systems and software development to incorporate future enhancements and capabilities.</p>
<p>The AN/BPS-17(V)1 RADAR System consists of hardware and software components that provide submarine navigation, contact tracking and collision avoidance. The major Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) hardware components for the installed AN/BPS-17(V)1 RADAR System consist of:</p>
<p>&bull; Primary Raymarine RD418HD Radar (Mast mounted)<br />&bull; Secondary Raymarine RD418HD Radar (Clip On)<br />&bull; Inboard Control Electronics (ICE) (power and network media connection/conversion)<br />&bull; Pressure Proof Mast/Pod<br />&bull; Primary Server (appropriate TI-xx configuration)<br />&bull; Secondary Server (appropriate TI-xx configuration)<br />&bull; Electronic Hull Penetrators (EHPs) and Dip Loops</p>
<p>The BPS-17(V)1 Radar Manager Software (BRMS) software component provides an independent operator interface to two BPS-17(V)1 Radar Processing Units (primary and secondary servers) and interfaces to TACLAN to provide contact data. BRMS is used to set the Radio Frequency (RF) generation, transmission, reception, and video signal processing parameters of the BPS-17(V)1 Radar Units and also displays radar video, contacts, alerts, Digital Nautical Charts (DNC) information, and system warnings to the operator.</p>
<p>The BRMS is intended to support navigation, station keeping, general surface search Radar functions, and contact avoidance. The Radar software will provide a video indication of the position of surface ships, surface craft, buoys, shorelines and navigational marks while supporting contact designation. The system is intended to improve the standard of collision avoidance by automatically providing information to the operators that will enable them to execute collision avoidance with multiple contacts as well as manually plotting a single contact. The system is also intended to provide continuous, accurate, and rapid situational awareness and evaluation.</p>
<p>The Government requests that interested sources provide a detailed response that addresses the following:</p>
<p>1.) Software Development and Integration and Test<br />a. Provide a description of your software development capabilities and experience to include integration and testing.<br />b. Provide a description of any experience with meeting Information Assurance (IA) requirements.<br />c. Describe the approach to deliver mature and reliable software that meets system specifications.</p>
<p>2.) System Design<br />a. Provide details of how you propose to provide a design that includes an open systems approach for using modular design and COTS components that is capable of being incrementally upgraded.<br />b. Provide an overall technical description of the functions and capabilities that you are capable of delivering.</p>
<p>3.) Radar Experience<br />a. Provide a description of the experience you have interfacing and controlling Radars and processing radar data to acquire and track contacts.</p>
<p>4.) Maintenance Philosophy<br />a. Describe your approach to maintain and repair a similar system onboard US Navy submarines (i.e., operational and intermediate level maintenance).<br />b. Describe your approach and capability to perform depot maintenance for a similar system.</p>
<p>5.) Other<br />a. Describe any additional information or resources necessary to compete on this procurement should a solicitation be released.<br />b. Provide a company point of contact, small business size, and any other information to assist in determining whether your company may be able to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this sources sought notice is strictly voluntary. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. All information provided by the respondents can be marked "business sensitive" and will only be shared between Government activities and employees. Responses can be classified up to the SECRET level but need to be marked and handled appropriately in accordance with the referenced security classification guides for the RADAR system.</p>
<p>The Government will accept specific questions or comments submitted in response to this notice or information provided as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. The Government may or may not be able to provide answers to all questions at this time.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced later via FedBizOpps and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this sources sought notice. Response to this notice is not a request to be added to a bidders list or to receive a copy of a solicitation. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong>NOTICE OF AWARD <br />13 June 2016<br /></strong><br />The Air Force awarded a $445,900,944 contract on 13 Jun 2016 to L3 National Security Solutions (NSS) for the operations, maintenance, and sustainment of the Air Force Satellite Control Network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Consolidated Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Modifications, Maintenance, and Operations (CAMMO) contract is a Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF) contract which has been awarded through a competitive, best-value source selection process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CAMMO contract will be for a maximum period of seven years with a six-month extension of services option (one 1-year base + six 1-year options + 6-month extension of services option).
<p>"CAMMO combines operations, maintenance, and sustainment from three contracts into a single vertically integrated contract vehicle," said Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space and SMC commander. "By vertically integrating AFSCN contracted work, the government expects economies of scale, economies of scope, and productivity gains; as well as efficiencies compelled by competition resulting in significant projected savings."</p>
<p>The CAMMO contract is a services acquisition effort integrating and consolidating AFSCN weapon system and operating location requirements from two existing contracts into a single operations, maintenance, and sustainment (OM&amp;S) contract. The two existing contracts are: the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) and the Network and Space Operations and Maintenance (NSOM) contract. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Current operations, operations support, remote site support, and Level 1 (organizational) maintenance is provided under the NSOM contract with Harris Information Technology Services (HITS) Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sustainment, Level 2 (depot) maintenance, sustainment modifications, and factory compatibility testing are provided under the SCNC with Honeywell Technology Solutions Incorporated (HTSI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">This approach will require the CAMMO contractor to provide a defined level of service across the network based on system performance measures. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This will incentivize the contractor to implement efficient processes across OM&amp;S and have the opportunity to optimize their workforce, subject to mandatory requirements of the Performance Work Statement and compliance documents. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The objective of CAMMO is to maintain performance and reduce OM&amp;S cost for the AFSCN without adding additional risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This acquisition strategy enables AF Space Command to streamline critical space operations, save scarce funding, and usher in a new era of vertically integrated service-based contracting for the AFSCN.</p>
<p>The AFSCN is a global network of communications and computer systems that support a growing inventory of increasingly complex space vehicles which support operational forces in peace and wartime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is designed to have the flexibility to support a wide spectrum of orbiting satellites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A large number of satellites with various altitudes and orbit inclinations are supported on a 24-hour per day, 7-day a week schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the primary support provided to DoD, the AFSCN also provides services for non-DoD organizations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and U.S. - sponsored programs of foreign governments.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">The Space and Missile Systems Center is the U.S. Air Force's center of acquisition excellence for acquiring and developing military space systems including Global Positioning System, military satellite communications, defense meteorological satellites, space launch and range systems, satellite control networks, space-based infrared systems, and space situational awareness capabilities.</span></p>

<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt .75in">4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authority Cited</span> - This action is authorized under the provisions of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reason for Authority Cited</span> - The contractor, Suddenlink, is the only provider in the Charleston, WV area who has a hard-wired service is able to provide cable services and internet services (bundled) not via satellite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The currently 3 service providers in the area Direct TV, Dish Network, and Suddenlink communications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current service from Direct TV and Dish Network is spotty and inconsistent with the high winds near flightline, and terrain in West Virginia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The satellite service providers require an initial expenditure of $25,000 -$30,000 for hardware that must be maintained and replaced at wing expense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenlink provides better hard-wired service with better reliability, and no initial hardware costs, and all equipment is maintained by Suddenlink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Wing Commander has mandated that we provide a better quality more reliable service, and the only provider that meets these requirements is Suddenlink.

<p>&nbsp;6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Efforts to Obtain Competition</span> - Internet researched, contacted public service commission, and reviewed pricing online for Dish Network, discussed need for purchase of equipment with current provider (Direct TV).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Spoke with Suddenlink representatives to determine cost of moving to Suddenlink cable (previously held at the 130 AW). All market research and information gathered for this requirement shows that anything other than Suddenlink would not be in the best interests of the government, as pricing for Suddenlink is not only much more consistent, but service from any other provider would most likely be problematic for 130<sup>th</sup> Communications Squadron personnel in having to call a satellite provider on a regular basis to adjust the satellite due to the high winds near the flightline and the terrain of the base.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 0in">&nbsp;7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Action to Increase Competition</span> - It is not feasible to provide for full and open competition in the current acquisition because no other company can provide the bundled television and internet services needed for this project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17, VA Texas Valley Coastal Bend Health Care System, Harlingen Texas.  The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Lindsey Hooge.  The Department of Veterans Affairs proposes to modify VA257-17-C-0168, on the basis of other then full and open competition for Construction Services, Refurbish & Restore Corpus Christi Outpatient Clinic (OPC) for Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) Model.  Purchase Request Number 740-18-1-5033-0002.  

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition.  The proposed action is for Construction Services, Refurbish & Restore Corpus Christi OPC for PACT Model.  Network Contract Office (NCO) 17 intends to negotiate and award a Firm-Fixed-Price modification to Contract Number VA257-17-C-0168 with TLC Construction, LLC, 1959 Saratoga Blvd. Bld. 10, Corpus Christi, TX 78417. 

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  The Engineering Department at Texas Valley Coastal Bend Health Care System, Harlingen, Texas has a requirement for Construction Services to change the Corpus Christi OPC into a PACT Model.  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, and project management for completion of the Corpus Christi OPC restoration to PACT model design standards.  The estimated period of performance for this modification is 20 calendar days.  The estimated value of this modification is $319,597.00.   

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC Sec. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  

(X) (1) Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency
Requirements per FAR 6.302-1

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The proposed source for this action is TLC Construction, LLC, 1959 Saratoga Blvd. Bld. 10, Corpus Christi, TX 78417.  TLC is currently the General Contractor for the Hurricane Harvey Restoration of the Corpus Christi OPC.  The project modification consists of remodeling the existing estimated 20,000 s.f. of Primary Care Space into the configuration of the VA PACT model; to include architectural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems specifically affecting approximately 6000s.f.  As a part of the project it is expected that the final product will be functional with all MEP system to include security, fire alarm, ets. as per VA, VHA, city, state and federal guidelines.  
The PACT Space Module layout streamlines patient flow and allows public functions and certain staff functions to span across multiple modules that simplify Veteran, staff, and public circulation both within and across clinical areas. The space configuration creates separate Patient Care Zones (on-stage) and Teamwork Zones (off-stage) which improves workflow and privacy. Using on-stage and off-stage strategies and thoughtfully developed operational adjacencies, the integrated clinic design configurations are flexible and adaptable and can readily respond to care system evolution, allowing clinical services to change over time without major disruption to the patient experience. These strategies and adjacencies support processes that bring care to the veteran. Benefits of the Integrated Clinic include:
  Shorter travel distance and time for staff and Veterans
  Consultation and issue resolution in real time
  Alignment of demand and capacity
  Communication and transitions among staff
  Warm hand-offs between staff and Veterans
  Reduced wasteful and redundant activities
  Enhanced adaptability and flexibility
  Improved privacy

In response to the PACT Space module, it has been determined that the CCOPC restoration should include the remodel of the Clinic into a PACT Model, thereby increasing Patient Care.  It is in the best interest of the VA and the Veteran Patients, to remodel the CCOPC to the PACT model, during the overall restoration of the clinic.  The remodel will save the VA time and money, since the remodel will be completed, while the restoration of the clinic is underway, thus ensuring that area s that would have been re-constructed under the restoration, and then have to be removed are not re-constructed.  Furthermore, as the restoration of the clinic did require extensive demolition of damaged areas, it makes fiscal sense to complete the PACT remodel, while the entire clinic is under construction.  Lastly this remodel into a PACT clinic only adds 20 calendar days to the restoration of the CCOPC s period of performance, thus ensuring that Veterans and Providers can return to using the CCOPC more quickly and not requiring the VA to either shut down the clinic again or phase construction in an active clinic.    Accordingly, TLC possesses the requisite capabilities, knowledge, and expertise to provide the construction services required.  TLC has qualified staff with the required pre-requisite construction experience.  Based on the above information, the Government has determined that TLC is capable of meeting VA s requirement.   
Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:   Project timeline constraints did not afford the government the ability to conduct a detailed market research for the market research section.  It was imperative to move right into selecting a contractor to avoid any costly time delays.   Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(B) the Contracting Officer shall determine pricing fair and reasonable based on a comparison of the proposed price with the independent government estimate (IGCE).  The IGCE for this procurement is $319,597.00.  In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(3) the Contracting Officer has determined that information on competitive proposed prices or previous prices were not available or insufficient.  This CO s determination is based on competitive on competitive proposed prices or previous prices is not available or is insufficient.  This CO s determination is based on the specialized nature of this modification, traditionally this type of work would specifically be all inclusive in a larger Construction Contract (complex); therefor individual pricing for this specific pricing is not available.  As such the Contracting Officer, has determined that a comparison of the proposed labor hours to the IGCE shall be used to determine the price to be fair and reasonable.  Furthermore, the Contracting Officer will compare the contractors proposed labor hours to the IGCE proposed labor and conduct a review of the construction price against the VAMC Cost Guide for VISN17, which is prepared by The Office of Construction & Facilities Management and is valid through October 2014.  Currently the VAMC Cost Guide for VISN VAMC estimates the rate of $233/sf for Total Renovation in Corpus Christi, TX.  The requirement for FAR 15.406-2, Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data are not applicable to this acquisition. 

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was not conducted due to Sole Source direction.  The time limitation of the original project and this modification would have resulted in the project being stopped and costing the government an unreasonable amount in labor hours of delay.  

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:   See Section VI above.  See Section VI above. 

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine any future acquisition strategy.  Additionally, consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.

OFOC SOP Revision 04   Page 1 of 2
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 04 Date: 10/01/2015
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.

1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$71,655
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

A service agreement is required for multiple Hologic Mammography systems at the Washington DC VAMC.  The VA utilizes the mammography systems to scan, examine, and diagnose patients for breast cancer. The facility requires a service agreement to maintain the mammography system uptime and replacement part coverage. The service agreement should also cover vendor required preventative maintenance inspections.  

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Hologic is the original equipment manufacturer and sole provider of the Hologic Mammography System. As such, Hologic is uniquely qualified to perform the repair services and necessary maintenance. Also, Hologic has immediate access to all parts and trained/qualified technicians necessary to maintain the equipment.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
As the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Hologic is uniquely qualified to provide replacement parts and trained technicians to perform the necessary repair services on the Hologic equipment.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
No market research was conducted. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Hologic is uniquely qualified to provide repair services for the Mammography Hologic Systems at the facility.



6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
