<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source purchase order to procure a Wind Tracer Pulsed Doppler Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) for windshear detection service at Las Vegas (LAS) McCarran International Airport. Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.   This specific requirement is to support the Office of Terminal Weather's mission to improve windshear detection performance at (LAS) McCarran International Airport.  The Terminal Doppler Weather Radar is not designed for optimum performance in dry climate conditions, and is not meeting specification for probability of detection and false alarm.  Test and evaluation of the Wind Tracer has validated the LIDAR as the solution to complement the TDWR at airports in dry climate locations.  Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies Wind Tracer consists of environmental equipment shelter, transceiver and electronics, scanner, signal processing system, air conditioner/heater, UPS Backup, system control and monitoring. The WindTracer is capable of providing air traffic with wind shear detection alerts in the format established by other FAA wind shear systems.  The purchase will also include site survey, logistics, planning, relocation and installation, two graphic situational displays and two years of full service maintenance. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement because of the time constraints associated with the deployment of this system in time for dry climate conditions commencing in the June timeframe to insure safe and efficient operations at LAS.  It is in the best interest of the FAA to procure the demonstration system as a single source to Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies' in order to meet the time constraints that support safe and efficient operations.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will review that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Loni Chinn, Contracting Officer by 11:00 A.M. EST, Wednesday, February 13, 2008.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award Phase 1b Virtual Mission Training System (VMTS) as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement, N00019-05-G-0026.  This is a continuation of an existing contractual effort to integrate a synthetic radar VMTS into the US Navy T-45C trainer aircraft.  The period of performance will be approximately twenty four months and the requirement will involve the non-recurring engineering and integration services in support of an aircraft Engineering Change Proposal.

The integration efforts include the non-recurring engineering design, integration, test, validation and verification of two flight-worthy VMTS retrofit kits that will be incorporated into a production representative T-45C aircraft.  The kits shall include VMTS hardware and aircraft modification hardware in accordance with PRF-T45 VMTS-001 specifications.  This Order will deliver the retrofit modification drawing package to install the VMTS kits into the flight test aircraft, produce sufficient hardware equipment to satisfy supplier and laboratory integration testing and provide enough spares to support the VMTS flight test effort.

The synthetic radar will emulate an existing F/A-18 radar system and include capabilities such as a radar warning receiver, air-to-air weapons simulation, and fleet representative radar controls.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort as a sole source procurement to The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source).  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator and producer of the T-45 aircraft, thus the only firm that possesses the requisite knowledge and integration capability to satisfy the pending requirement in the required timeframe.

This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. This synopsis is provided for information purposes only. A determination not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the United States Government.

<SUBJECT>66--PROCUREMENT OF PM2.5 CARBON SPECIATION SAMPLERS FOR THE CHEMICAL SPECIATION NETWORK
<SOLNBR>N2350086034
<ARCHDATE>02072009
<CONTACT>Sybil Winfield Contract Specialist 3039692076     sybil_winfield@contractor.nps.gov;
<DESC>N2350086034 PROCUREMENT OF PM2.5 CARBON SPECIATION SAMPLERS FOR THE CHEMICAL SPECIATION NETWORK The National Park Service (NPS), in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is planning to procure an estimated 70 to 140 PM2.5 carbon aerosol samplers for implementation into the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN). This CSN PM2.5 carbon aerosol sampler provides for the measurement of the mass concentration of fine particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) in ambient air.  Samples are collected on a filter substrate over a 24-hour period.  The filters are subsequently laboratory analyzed for carbon species or classes of carbon. The PM2.5 carbon aerosol sampler is specified by a combination of design and performance requirements.  The design is identical in most respects to the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) Network Version II Module C, except that an active mass or volumetric flow control unit has replaced the critical orifice.  The sample train of the sampler (including the inlet cap, inlet tube, cyclone, four-filter manifold, cassette, etc.) must exactly match the IMPROVE Version II Module, with no exceptions.   See http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/monitoring/carbonSamplerSpecs/  for carbon sampler specifications. The sampler shall also include an air pump, active volumetric or mass flow rate control unit, flow measurement device, filter temperature sensor, barometric pressure sensor, programmable controller, and data-logging system for all parametric sensors or measurement devices, i.e., flow rate, temperature, pressure, date and time, calibration and audit results.  The sampler should be equipped with an outdoor environmental enclosure, self-supporting stand and suitable mechanical, electrical, or electronic control capability to meet or exceed the specified design and functional performance. Sampler control and performance are also explicitly specified to accommodate CSN and IMPROVE quality assurance and data management requirements.  Control and sample collection programming, monitored parameters, digital file formats, filter and data management procedures, and other operational performance must fully meet the specific criteria set forth in this procurement. Manufactured systems (or system components) must be individually packaged for UPS/FedEx ground shipment, be accompanied by a detailed operator/instruction manual, include packaging and assembly instructions, and be covered by a one-year warrantee.  The samplers must be manufactured exactly as specified in an ISO 9001-registered facility. It is anticipated that 50 to 70 samplers will be purchased in 2008, with the possibility of an additional 50 to 70 samplers purchased in 2009.  Delivery of the first of the 2008 samplers must begin within 16 weeks of the order in lots of at least 10 per month.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be created for up to 2 years (1 year plus a 1 year option).  Minimum order would be 50 samplers.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Tecplot Software License Maintenance renewal and technical support.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Tecplot, Inc., as the only known source who can meet Agency requirements. Tecplot's unique plotting and analysis software has three different mechanisms to enhance the analysis environment, including customizable working environment, an extensive macro language, and an addon development capability. Tecplot's macros enable the rapid repetitive operations of performing analysis of data and construction of data required for other experimental and computational analyses.  Tecplot Inc. is the sole owner and developer of the Tecplot software. It would take substantial duplication of time and effort for another company to provide a comparable software and those costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 22, 2008.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source modification for security guard services at Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, MT.  Contract N02-AO-40060 (HHSN2722004000060C) with Side Bar and Associates Inc. will be modified to add 14 to 15 additional security guard positions beginning April 2008.  This increase will continue through the current option year ending June 30, 2008 at which time the NIH Police force is expected to relieve the contractor staff added by this contract modification.  Positions may be armed and unarmed.  Side Bar and Associates is the only available source for this requirement.  Side Bar currently provides all security guard services for the RML campus.  Security requirements on the campus require all security staff to be inter-changeable and to work in a cohesive environment. The combination of two different companies could pose a security risk if the companys policies and procedures differ.  In addition, the combination of two different security guard companies would require additional supervision, as Side Bars supervisors would not be able to supervise another contractors employees and vice versa.  Additional supervisors would result in duplication of costs.  For these reasons, it is in the Governments best interest to obtain all security services for the RML campus from one security company.  All inquires regarding this modification should be directed to Ivan Hernandez by March 17, 2008 at ihernandez@niaid.nih.gov.  See note 22.

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The office of Acquisition management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS) is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-mail division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of BlueCoat Equipment and Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the BlueCoat product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet. The equipment listed above is required to expand existing equipment that has reached the processing capacity. The Caching Servers will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's critical operating environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure. The replacement BlueCoat models are major components of the Department's firewall infrastructure and any deviations form the BlueCoat appliances and support would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of web browsing to the Department of State employees. The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources are available to end users under normal conditions and in the event of a disaster. Blue Coat equipment and support is critical for continuing production to the internet caching process. This is an urgently needed, highly-specialized, best-fit requirement, based upon prior utilization of BlueCoat products, maintenance, and support.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accuity, 4709 Golf Road, Suite 600, Skokie, Illinois 60076 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements to purchase hardware maintenance and support services as outlined below.  This is a continuation of services for the Access to Financial Institution (AFI) Project.  The Foster Care Independence Act gives SSA the right to require Supplemental Security Income (SSI) applicants, recipients and deemors to give authorization to financial institutions (FI) to provide verification of an SSI applicant's, recipient's or deemor's financial assets.  SSA's current process for obtaining asset verification is paper-based.  The form SSA-4641-U2, Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Obtain Account Records From A Financial Institution and Request for Records, is mailed to the FI and asks the FI to provide the balance held in a financial account at specified dates.  The purpose of the AFI is to convert to electronic media the information exchanges (e.g., form SSA-4641-U2) that now occurs in paper form between FIs and SSA; obtain titling, balance and related information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor in addition to verifying the account balance and interest income revealed by the applicant, recipient or deemor; detect unreported accounts in financial institutions located in proximity to the home address of the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor and to automate the process whereby FIs are reimbursed for the cost of account verification.  SSA is seeking continued contractor support to maintain the front-end and back-end operation of the SSI Asset Verification Program, including the GUARD Application, which SSA and Accuity have worked on for the past four years.  Accuity serves as the official registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institution that meets the criteria established by the ABA; it is believed that every financial institution in the US must utilize them to assign, to retire, or to change a routing number.  In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, Accuity collects, processes, and maintains a database of current information on financial institutions worldwide.  SSA previously awarded successive orders, of one year each, to Accuity, for the Proof of Concept (POC) for these services. During the POC phase, Accuity successfully demonstrated a process for verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states.  This phase of the POC demonstrated that the system design and its operation would substantially improve the SSA-4641-U2 process.  The next phase of the POC involved an expansion of Accuity automated asset verification process including the use of Accuity's Geographical Undisclosed Account Radial Detection (GUARD) function to detect undisclosed financial accounts to all 110 Field Offices (FO) in the states of New York and New Jersey and to a limited number of users in the Office of Quality Performance (OQP) 15 regional sites.  QOP conducted an extensive evaluation of the Accuity process in New York/New Jersey FO's and the findings supported the expansion of the Accurity process to additional SSA FO's nationwide and the recruitment of additional FI?s as participants.  As a result of OQP's study SSA contracted with Accuity to expand its operations to all FO's in the state of California.  SSA now intends to issue a firm fixed price contract for the period April 2008 thru January 2009, for (a) continued support of the front-end and back-end operation of the SSI Asset Verification Program, including the GUARD application in the New York/New Jersey and California FO's and OQP's regional sites; (b) management information, program data and analytical support for evaluating ongoing operations and additional Program growth opportunities for current and future phases and (c) develop an isolated/dedicated facility for encrypting backups for files associated with SSI Asset Verification Program.  To date, Accuity is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers, name and social security number as the identifying information.  SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services.  The research has resulted in Accuity being the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA.  Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accuity for follow-on services and is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Accuity may respond in writing no later than February 22, 2008, with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA?s objective.  Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information.  Interested parties that feel they can provide these services shall respond by submitting their capability statement by e-mail to Valerie.Jones@ssa.gov.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT-- FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with negotiations with Accuity.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Corporate Franchise Data Center - Austin, 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX 78772 intends a sole source award to ATG for the VA Loan Guaranty Service (LGS) requirement of ATG technical support services for the current Veteran Information Portal (VIP) environment. VIP uses the ATG portal product as the core component of its information and web service delivery architecture. As VA expands the use of VIP, access to self-servicing benefits will increase and the current architecture must expand in an effective manner to support the delivery of benefits. Services are required in order to take advantage of the full functionality of the ATG product.  Professional Services include the following: a.	VIP has a business need to present dynamic web content to the end user base within each user community. This is currently done programmatically using a custom JSP page. A more flexible approach is required so that the content can be organized as small "Portlets" that can be presented to the user with minimal development effort. Even though ATG supports organization of web content as gears/portlets, often presentation of these portlets in a visually acceptable manner is not possible due to the varying sizes of the portlets. This is further complicated by the fact that a user can reorganize the content on the web pages using customization features. ATG provides some templates for organizing portlets on a web page, but these are not sufficient to cover all the permutations and combinations caused by varying sizes of the portlets. LGS needs to have a solution that provides a clean commercial website look and that can be maintained without sacrificing customized features. LGS needs assistance in identifying different best practice approaches. b.	Business users require the ability to create and assign communities without any programmatic changes. Earlier versions of VIP supported the addition of new communities; it allowed creation of new "tabs", which could be assigned to the newly created community. This approach is no longer supported now since a tabbed structure conflicts with new top and side menus mandated under the VA's 6102 standards. In addition, all pages must comply with 508 standards. c.	VIP is not using ATG's Adaptive Scenario Engine (ASE).  "	Technical issues exist that cause the Scenario Engine to not start cleanly in our environment.  "	LGS requires the capabilities provided by the Adaptive Scenario Engine; such as Alerts, Targeted Content, Targeted email messages, etc.  d.	Use of portlets that come with the product: "	LGS requires assistance in the use of the Outlook gear, and the ability to provide single sign-on into the web based Outlook for all the Active Directory users. "	LGS also requires assistance in the use of built-in Web Service based portlets to build service-oriented components. e.	Resolution of ongoing issues "	The contractor shall review product configuration and recommend changes for improved performance and scalability, review current LM, DRP, PES settings and recommend changes. In addition, the contractor shall review production logs and startup scripts.  "	The contractor shall resolve Scenario Manager errors, and profile update problems in the clustered environment. "	The contractor shall make recommendations for the Web logic migration.  f.	The contractor shall provide on-call technical services support to assist VA with follow-up support to above tasks. Support can be provided by phone calls, e-mail, pc conferencing or on-site visit. Support will be requested via a designated POC both from VA and ATG. Authroity to award the sole source procurement can be found at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) or FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cots to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.The government would expect to duplicate the cost est. for the for this request if not provided by the software vendor. To the best of the Government's knowledge, ATG as the software vendor, has all the unique qualifications and access to proprietary code that would enable the government to release restrictions on the current implementation to allow full control of the software product.  The Government would expect to duplicate the cost est. for this request if not provided by the software vendor.  The Government would have to purchase the software code and develop the knowledge of altering it to perform the functionality required by these services.  Because the software manufacturer will not release the code, the cost of purchasing is unable to be estimated. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 3:00pm est on February 12, 2008. Third part firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the firm has been granted rights to provide the services being procured. The determination to open competition based on responses is solely with in the discretion of the Government. If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published. Responses should be emailed to kari.cozzens@va.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of Citrix Licenses. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Citrix Licensing product as a key component of the Department's OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm. The license listed above is required to support the system explansion and future growth of the ONE program. The Citrix licenses provide access to the Citrix server farm located within the Department of State for remote dial-in from posts and or stations throughout the U.S. and abroad.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items taht meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's ONE networking infrastructure. The ONE network infrastructure is a Citrix environment and any deviations to the Citrix licenses would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the remote servers to the Department of State employees. The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed.<BR><BR>Reposted to correct serial number in line 1.<BR><BR>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Q1: Please consider adding FAA certification as an alternate approval requirement other than the OEM or DOD. There is a wide variety of manufactures to address along with component diversity issues. The small business being the target vendor would not posses such certifications. You will notice Solicitation HSSCG38-08-R-H00002 was amended to include FAA certification for this reason.

A1: Due to the critical nature of these components, the requirement for OEM or DOD certification for the instruments in this solicitation remains in effect.

Title:  Digitization of NTIS Technical Reports 

Description:

The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), a bureau within the Department of Commerce (DOC), is planning to enter into multiple joint venture partnerships to digitize some or all of its collection of U.S. Federal Government Technical Reports.  NTIS is requesting information from qualified sources (including U.S. commercial, educational, foundation, not-for-profit, or government), that are interested in partnering by providing digitization services in support of NTIS? large scale legacy digitization initiative. This initiative encompasses digitizing some or all of NTIS? sizeable collection of approximately two million reports (representing an estimated 200 million pages) which exist in physical form (paper and microform).  The work scope will include a formal collaboration which will provide mutual beneficial results to both parties.  NTIS does not plan to contract for digitization services, but rather, to work with multiple partners in a way that results in both NTIS and the partners sharing in the benefits of the partnerships.

NTIS is a DOC bureau, whose mission is to promote progress by serving as the Federal Government?s central means of making technical information perpetually and widely available.  The NTIS collection was assembled over the past sixty years by collecting Federal Government reports from agencies representing 97% of the Federal Government R&D budget.

While NTIS envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services of legacy documents, NTIS also has a long-established in-house digitization effort to respond to the public?s requests and anticipates continuing this activity in-house.

NTIS intends to require qualified interested parties to demonstrate that they have or would be able to obtain all required personnel, technology and equipment to perform large-scale digitization that would result in output which is in accordance with industry standards and include, but not be limited to:

For each digitized item, an electronic copy of the physical document which is a fully faithful, unaltered TIFF file created as a result of the scanning process.  

For each digitized item, create a machine-readable file via an Optical Character Reader (OCR) that will accompany the digitized item.

Provide to NTIS an electronic copy of each digitized item together with the OCR file.

Accommodate special handling required of some fragile documents, as may be needed.

Integrate an electronic means of attribution to NTIS within the digitized copy of each document.

Provide periodic status reports outlining progress

As part of this arrangement, NTIS would provide tangible documents for scanning and prioritize material to be sent to the private or public sector participant for digitization. The private or public sector participant will be required to send the tangible documents back to NTIS after the digitization is complete.

Place of Performance
Address: The private or public sector participant will perform the digitization/scanning process at their own cost and at either the NTIS facility in Springfield, VA or another, mutually agreed to location.

Requested Information:

Keeping NTIS goals in mind please outline how your company would partner with NTIS to digitize this legacy collection and share in the benefits of such activities.  Each respondent must submit a packet of material which includes:

1.       A single page that expresses interest in this project, listing company points of contact (name, title, email and phone) 
2.       A separate White Paper and capability statement (no more than 25 pages total) that describes:
a.       Current digitization capabilities offered 
b.       A statement of process that will be followed to perform digitization
d.       The nature of the relationship envisioned with NTIS, including the nature of the beneficial joint partnership.

Questions regarding capability statements, white papers and other documentation must be submitted in writing to the address listed below or dcampion@ntis.gov. Questions must be submitted by Wednesday, February 27, 2008.

Capability statements must be submitted as MS Word Files by COB  on Wednesday, March 5, 2008, to dcampion@ntis.gov

NTIS may ask interested parties to clarify information provided or submit additional information. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:    This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate NTIS in any way.   This is not a request for proposal and NTIS will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.

Material submitted will be deemed proprietary to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations if so marked by the respondent.

<DESC>The Walla Walla District is issuing this proposed contract action for commercial supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Hydroacoustic Technology Incorporated (HTI) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   Currently, no other company can supply transmitters compatible with the existing HTI equipment due to their proprietary nature. HTI produces tra nsmitters that utilize a proprietary coding strategy using multiple pulses to transmit the information to the receiver.     This relatively new coding strategy allows many more uniquely identifiable transmitters to broadcast on the same frequency. <BR>Inte rested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     However, all proposals received within the next 15 days after date of publica tion of this synopsis will be considered by the G ovrenment.     A determination by the Government not to compete with proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will no rmally be considered solely for the purpose of determini ng whether to conduct a competitive procurement.     Notice to determine if there are an adequate number of interested business concerns capable of providing acoustic tags in accordance with the at t ached specifications within the required delivery period.

The IRC provides library services to AHRQ as a whole while providing targeted research support to Offices and Centers, program staff, and the public. Library services and research support are instrumental to the many research activities of AHRQ staff. Resources include a periodical and reference collection, on-line data retrieval systems, CD-ROM subscriptions, multi-media materials, and Web-based training.  The IRC performs customized searches using on-line and CD-ROM sources, handles reference questions for clients, and fulfills interlibrary loan requests. The IRC is a member of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, the Federal Libraries and Information Centers Coordinating Committee, and the DHHS Libraries Consortium.  The 3 key functions of the IRC are to: 1) Administer Day-to-Day Activities of the IRC, 2) Manage Information, Reference, and Research Services, 3) Provide Training, Evaluation, and Support Services to AHRQ staff.

The AHRQ Web site provides electronic dissemination (ED) support across the Agency. The AHRQ Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) Web site enhances and builds upon OCKTs mandate to provide dissemination and research translation functions to AHRQ using a variety of venues. The OCKT Web staff coordinates their activities with other components of OCKT (public affairs, publishing, and KT staff), as well as other AHRQ Offices and Centers, other Federal Agencies, and DHHS. Many of the Agencys programs and constituency groups depend heavily on timely, accurate, and reliable information provided on the Web.

The OCKT Web staff ensures that products and tools are generically accessible to users and provides the support required to maintain and enhance on-line information access for the AHRQ Web site, other third-level domain Web sites supported by AHRQ, Web-based tools and services (including support for the Virtual Library), related electronic products from Agency programs, and DHHS and other inter-agency and partnership portal projects. The Intranet contributes to knowledge management activities of the Agency and access to research resources through the Virtual Library.

The Web staff codes, updates, and loads approximately 7,000 new and replacement files per year (40 percent new files, and 60 percent replacement). In addition, they provide support for numerous other activities that impact on provision of electronic information services to the Agencys internal and external clients.   The 4 key functions for the Web Services are: 1) Maintain AHRQ Web Site, Including Web Page Design, Coding, and Loading Files to the Site, and Template Development, 2) Provide Multimedia Services, 3) Administer and Provide Information Management Services, 4) Support AHRQ IT Infrastructure.

The Project Director must demonstrate they possess, at a minimum, ten (10) years of experience working managing contracts in relevant technical areas and: 1) at least three (3) years in the substantive supervisory positions; and 2) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals.  Key technical personnel should possess the education, experience, and demonstrated skills to implement the activities as stated above.  Sources must demonstrate the credentials of all Web coders and librarians to ensure appropriate experience and/or degrees/certifications.

Interested 8 (a) firms with a GSA Schedule Contract ONLY should submit their capability statements (no more than 15 pages in length) to Jessica Alderton, Contracting Officer, by email at jessica.alderton@ahrq.DHHS.gov, no later than 12pm (noon) EST on Monday, February 25, 2008.  Capability statements must be tailored to this request and identify the sources capabilities to complete this requirement.  Organizations must also specify (on the cover page) the GSA Schedule their contract falls under (example: 8(a) Stars, E-buy, GSA Advantage, etc.), their GSA contract number(s) and any small business designation in addition to being an 8(a) company.  It is AHRQs intention to solicit this project to those interested 8 (a) contractors under the GSA Schedule (specific schedule to be determined based upon responses to this sources sought notice).

<DESC>PEACE - Market Research

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting study entitled: PEACE (Project on Ebsteins Anomaly Study in Children).  Specifically, a contractor will be selected to recruit approximately 900 families over a three year period from communities in Ukraine.  Children with Ebsteins anomaly/tricuspid valve disease (referred to as case) will be recruited to the study, and also parents of the children will be recruited to the study. Controls will be recruited from the same neighborhoods as the cases (children with Ebsteins anomaly) and will also include the parents. Controls will be matched by age, sex and region of origin to cases in a ratio of two controls for each case. If neither parent is available, at least one other blood relative will be recruited in place of the parents. The more general diagnosis of tricuspid valve disease is to be included in the selection of participants, since often those with mild forms of Ebsteins are not appropriately diagnosed. The subjects will be interviewed by a physician, and medically evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.  Blood, cheek and saliva tissue samples will be collected to obtain DNA for a genome wide association analysis. Usually each family will only need to be seen once.  A goal of PEACE, although not a requirement to be performed or funded as part of this acquisition, is the identification of the genetic basis for Ebsteins anomaly, a birth defect involving malformation of the tricuspid valve of the heart.  Such findings may yield insight into disease mechanisms that may provide novel diagnostic tools as well as therapeutic strategies for medical remediation of this often life threatening and debilitating congenital heart disease. (The analyses associated with the collection of samples will take place at the NHLBI.)   

The technical requirements associated with this acquisition include the following:   

1.	Recruit approximately 300 subjects with Ebsteins anomaly and their parents and approximately 600 control subjects and their parents for PEACE.

2.	Assist in explaining the nature of the PEACE study to subjects and/or parents of subjects and obtain signed consent/assent for participation in study.

3.	Obtain from each family, information on family history with administration of questionnaire to assess possible environmental risk factors.

4.	Assist NIH team in evaluating and validating subjects and parents of subjects with Ebsteins anomaly by Doppler echocardiography and obtaining electrocardiogram. In parallel, age matched neighborhood control subjects and their parents will be evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and using electrocardiogram to validate they do not have Ebsteins anomaly.

5.	Provide nursing staff or physician who will obtain blood, buccal swab, and saliva tissue samples suitable for the extraction of genetic material (genomic DNA) for tests to analyze possible genetic causes for Ebsteins anomaly. Note: analysis of genetic DNA is not a technical requirement of this contract.  

6.	Store samples and securely package and ship all tissue and blood samples to NIH. 

7.	Copy onto CD/DVD all ultrasound and EKG data, and securely package and ship CD/DVD to NIH.

8.	Coordinate and make all travel arrangements for subjects and their parents to come to the contractor site in conjunction with the schedule visits of the NIH site visit team.

9.	Assist in making local housing arrangements, transportation, and English translator for NIH site visit team.

10.	Provide appropriate private space for subject interview and evaluation, including sufficient room for housing ultrasound and electrocardiogram machines, and for conducting ultrasound and electrocardiogram evaluations.

11.	Assist NIH team in the preparation of data obtained from PEACE for scientific publication(s) in appropriate biomedical journal to report and share findings with the biomedical research community.

12.	Provide project administrator to coordinate PEACE activities at contractor site in Ukraine with work at NIH in Bethesda, MD.


All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements by February 25, 2008. The estimated award date is July 31, 2008.  The NAICS code is 541712. This is not a request for proposals. Questions may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Kristiane Cooper, cooperke@nhlbi.nih.gov, 301-435-4435 or the Contract Specialist, Nora Rivera, riveran@nhlbi.nih.gov, 301-434-0345.

The capabilities statement shall include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientific, medical expert, and technical personnel in accordance with the above requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) any other information considered relevant to this program, and 5) if your institution is a small business, please provide certification of the type of small business as designated by the Small Business Administration. Do not include budget information. We ask that the capabilities statement not exceed 20 single sided or 10 double sided pages in length. Two (2) copies of the capabilities statement must be received at the following address no later than 15 days from the publication date of this notice. Responses that do not adhere to these guidelines will not be considered.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for the purpose of obtaining market research only. No proposals are being requested nor accepted under this notice. 

A market survey is being conducted to access industry's capability and interest in developing medical standards and physical fitness requirements for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) positions.  The standards and requirements are used for pre-employment and employment decisions (i.e., pre-employment, retention, fitness for duty).  The procedures used to develop the standards, criteria and methods of administration and document the relationship to job performance must be consistent with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.  This includes complying with federal regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations-Chapter 339 and federal laws enforced by EEOC (e.g, Rehabilitation Act, American's with Disabilities Act).  

The work will require a determination and documentation of the minimum level of health status and physical fitness necessary for successful performance.  An analysis of the essential functions of the position shall be conducted in order to determine the abilities (motor, physical, non-physical) necessary for performance of the essential duties.  Documented evidence of objective measures of the work or performance is required.  Physiological assessments of workload should be obtained to evaluate prolonged or intermittent physical work and psychophysical methods used to evaluate frequent and infrequent work tasks.  Psychophysical methods should be applied to examine the relationship between work capacity and perceived levels of physical exertion. 

The work requires recommendation of appropriate medical standard and physical fitness requirements for the specific position that measure the level of health status or fitness.  This will require the contractor to determine the content of the medical screening/exam, the standard physical assessment test(s), and standard tests that measure the level of fitness (i.e, muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, cardiovascular-respiratory endurance), and the job-related pass/fail criteria required to optimize safe and efficient performance of the job requirements essential to the specific position or occupation.  

The anticipated North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is  541612. 

Interested and qualified vendors are asked to provide an electronic capability statement to LaNita.Calhoun@dhs.gov no later than March 3, 2008. In the e-mail subject line state: Sources Sought Medical Standards. Telephone responses will not be honored. 

Note: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, only a Request for Information. No Award will result from this notice of Sources Sought.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only for a qualified service disabled veteran owned small business.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantage and Large Business) relative to the NAICS Code 541611. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and MUST respond to the following questions: 1) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 2) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 3) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 4) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 5) Are you a certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? In addition, the respondent must provide a capability statement which addresses the offeror?s qualifications to perform the work described below.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requires the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to continue the operation of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Workplace Helpline for a contract period of one year with four optional years.  The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week.  It is estimated that an average of 8 to 10 inquiries are received per day.  The Helpline individuals will normally operate the Helpline Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).    

In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drug abuse in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts.  In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer questions about drug abuse in the workplace.  The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this requirement was initiated in 1987 and has continued uninterrupted since.  Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the CSAP/SAMHSA.  In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs of abuse.  Additionally, the Workplace Helpline expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based program whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drugs of abuse in its community workplace.

The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent-small businesses.  As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy.  Small businesses also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems.  The Workplace Helpline also answers a significant number of calls by individuals inquiring about workplace drug testing and substance abuse prevention and treatment issues regarding prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol use.  The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.

This is not request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Division of Contracts Management, 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville, MD 20857 (Fed Ex: 20850), Attn: Janet M. Mattson, Contracting Officer.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received in writing no later than February 22, 2008 by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  

Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective bidders/offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources announcement.  No solicitation is currently available.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI); it is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of a long range, medium lift Carrier On-Board Delivery (COD) Follow-on Aircraft to replace the current C-2A Greyhound.  The C-2A is expected to begin reaching service life limitations in 2017.  The COD Follow-on Aircraft needs to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2017 to avoid an anticipated force structure shortfall and ensure uninterrupted air logistics support for the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.

For purposes of this initial market RFI, prospective vendors should consider the following general performance requirements:  the COD Follow-on Aircraft shall be qualified to operate in all weather, in a maritime environment, and capable of operating to/from current and planned U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.  It shall also be operable from remote airfields without ground support equipment except as required for refueling and cargo transfer.  It shall have an aircrew consisting of 2 pilots and 2 crewmen.  It shall carry a minimum of 26 passengers and have cargo weight and volume capacity equal to or greater than the current C-2A.  It shall have a fully loaded range equal to or greater than that of the C-2A.  Its ready-for-flight length/wingspan shall not exceed that of the C-2A and it shall be capable of folding wings to reduce its deck footprint when not in operation.  It shall be compliant with Communications Navigation Surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS), and Crash Survivable Flight Incident Recording (CSFIR) requirements.

For planning purposes, contract award would occur no earlier than 2011.  The COD Follow-on Aircraft shall ensure a positive return on investment when compared to total ownership cost of the current C-2A.  The U.S. Navy C-2A inventory is currently 35 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through 2026 with retirements starting in 2017.  This program is currently unfunded.

Responses to this RFI are requested by 29 Feb 2008 and should include:
1.  A summary of the performance capabilities of the proposed replacement COD Follow-on Aircraft.
2.  A short description of the proposed design.
3.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of vendor non-recurring costs.
4.  A notional, high level program schedule.
5.  A ROM estimate of unit costs assuming a production rate of 4 aircraft per year.
6.  Any other information at vendor discretion, but limited to five 8? by 11 pages.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution system at Fort Knox, KY.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  

In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter 'Notice') is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Friday, February 29, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

The center provides direct-turn-over and off-island trans-shipments, storage and care of stock in storage (COSIS), issue of retail and wholesale material, packing, shipping and local delivery. The physical distribution operations are government owned and contractor operated (GOCO). Contract oversight and responsibility will be the responsibility of the DDGM Continuing Government Activity (CGA). The general scope of proposed contract actions are to include but are not limited to the following: (1) Provide receiving, storing, inventorying, issuing, packaging, trans-shipmenting and performing Special Projects; and (2) Provide all labor, material and supplies, Material Handling Equipment (MHE), and Garrison Mobile Equipment (GME) maintenance, to perform the distribution requirements. The performance period is for 1 year with a possibility of 4 one year options. Full performance is expected to begin on or about 23 July 2009. There will be a 3 month transition period, which will ensue just prior to full performance. This requirement is to be performed at the Defense Distribution Depot Guam (DDGM)located on the Naval Main Base, an 8,000-acre parcel which is part of the Navy Apra Harbor Complex.

<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

You have been identified as a potential bidder for our intended procurement.  General Services Administration's (GSA) Greater Southwest Region has a need for electric power to operate its federal government owned and occupied buildings located within deregulated areas of the Texas ERCOT marketplace. Buildings are located in the TXU, Reliant, CPL and WTU (lines and wires) transmission and delivery service delivery areas.  GSA is seeking cost effective proposals providing renewable wind generated electrical energy to be delivered to GSA facilities. 

GSA, as the U.S. Government's landlord, and property developer, operates and manages approximately 103 Government owned buildings and facilities located in the deregulated utility service areas of Texas. A listing of these buildings and facilities, locations, and usage history, will be provided to all offerors evaluated as technically qualified by the Government, and invited to participate in subsequent stages of the competitive procurement, or in further negotiations.  The GSA facilities consume approximately 134 million KWH of electric power each year.  The government is seeking a fixed price flat rate contract for a minimum term of ten years. Given the volatility of fuel costs and electricity prices, and the difficulty of determining where natural gas and other generation fuel markets are headed GSA requires stable supply and pricing. GSA has decided to address these issues by procurement of reliable, price stable and economical wind generated electric power to supply its facilities. Wind generated electric power is desirable because the wind will cost the same from year to year. Thus procurement of wind energy, acts as a hedge against continually escalating fossil fuel energy prices, while providing environmental benefits.  

GSA requires that all potential suppliers be a registered and licensed Texas retail electric provider (REP) (licensed in the State of Texas), or have entered into, a formal binding written agreement with a REP licensed in the State of Texas to provide the required services. This written agreement must be presented to the government for review and acceptance prior to selection for consideration as technically qualified.  The involvement of a Texas Licensed REP is required so as to be able to arrange for wholesale and retail power transactions, scheduling, load shaping and balancing, dispatch, delivery and transmission, and billing, as well as all other required tasks and services needed for the transportation, delivery, metering and billing, for the required power to be delivered at Government facilities, regardless of if it was expressly mentioned and enumerated here or not. 

The government intends to conduct this procurement as a two-step process. First, all offerors, responding to the RFP will be evaluated as to technical capability, experience, financial strength, and qualifications by the government.  Those offerors determined to be technically qualified, and most capable, will be selected and will then be included in a (short list) competitive range.  Second, the government will conduct a real time electronic reverse auction to select that offer which offers the best value to the government. Offerors will be evaluated on the factors set forth in the solicitation. Evaluation factors shall include  price, the amount of renewable and/or wind generated energy provided, duration of contract term, reliability of service, hedging strategy for any supplemental energy provided, technical ability and experience of personnel, financial strength, ability to deliver reliable low cost supply, and price, terms and conditions of the power purchase contract. 

The government is seeking a fixed price for a lengthy term of years.  GSA contemplates a ten- year contract unless Congress passes legislation that authorizes entry into a contract for a longer term of years.  Should Congress grant authority that is signed into law, prior to the conduct of the reverse auction and contract award GSA will amend this solicitation and seek a longer term contract for the maximum term authorized. 

The successful offerors REP shall handle all switching of accounts quickly accurately and efficiently. The REP will provide a dedicated account representative that has the authority to act to bind and commit the REP, and who can act quickly and effectively in response to government billing, delivery, and other business issues that may arise in the course of providing service to the government's buildings, and facilities, and who can resolve issues and problems that arise with the government's accounts, or delivery of service.  The U.S. Government pays for electricity in arrears, on a monthly basis, after it is delivered and used by the government, and is a highly creditworthy party to contract with and to do business with.  U.S. Government contracts are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 

GSA is cognizant that due to the intermittent nature of the wind resource other power may be necessary to supplement or shape the load to be delivered to GSA with other firm or more reliable sources of generation.  These supplemental sources of generation are needed to provide reliable firm delivery of power under any contract awarded under this solicitation.  Supplemental generation may consist of either:

1.	Conventional generation; or

2.	Other renewable power including, but not limited to,  complementary, redundant or additional wind power from other sources, hydro, solar, geothermal, land fill gas, bio-mass, or other alternative, or renewable energy sources capable of providing the firm delivery that is required by GSA; or 

3.	Proven Utility Scale energy storage capable of reliably providing power at cost effective prices; or

4.	Any combination of 1, 2 and 3 above, provided that a substantial percentage of wind generated power is provided the Government and price effectiveness, price stability, and reliability requirements are met.

Any of these sources will be acceptable, as supplemental power provided these sources (other than conventional generation) meet the definition of renewable energy set forth in Executive Order 12123, or its successors, and are cost effective to the agency. To the maximum extent feasible, it is desired that this required power and any supplemental power come from sources, as defined by Executive Order 12123, as renewable energy resources.   The choice of other supplemental power sources shall be the contractors business decision to make with the government only being interested in the delivery of inexpensively priced firm power to its facilities, on a reliable and cost effective basis, with as much of this power as is possible coming from renewable energy resources as defined in Executive Order 13123. Renewable energy provided to the government under this RFP and any subsequent award of a power purchase contract must be able to qualify as certified renewable energy under the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED building certification program. This is necessary so that Government buildings can receive LEED credit for the procurement of renewable energy for its facilities. 

If supplemental generation from landfill gas, biomass or other similar sources is offered (or if physical natural gas reserves in the ground, or in storage, are offered) GSA requires evidence that the offeror has the capability and economic wherewithal to provide the fuel at the price bid for the entire contract term. The government will require documentation supporting title to ownership of this offered resource. The offeror shall provide the government a valid legal opinion, and an independent petroleum engineer's report, indicating that the offeror has ownership and control of production, or reserves in the ground, or in storage, of sufficient amounts to fulfill the entire requirement for the term of the government's contract. Generally, for purposes of this RFP this would be a minimum of three times the amount of fuel needed by the electricity provider to supply the contract. This resource should be present in the reserves controlled or owned by the offeror.  The Offeror shall also covenant that during the duration of the contract the offeror will not to take any action that would reduce or diminish these reserves to the detriment of the government's rights and interest, under any contact awarded. Offeror's should refrain from such actions such as selling or pledging the reserves dedicated to the government to other parties. The proposal should provide for sufficient margins of reserve estimation error as may be needed to insure the ability to deliver for the entire contract term.

The contract awarded as a result of this request for proposals will be a requirements contract to supply all (100%) of the governments electricity needs in the designated buildings and areas covered by this solicitation.  There may be multiple contracts awarded to support the government's requirement, and for administrative purposes the government may issue multiple contracts to one or more suppliers.  GSA also constructs and acquires new federal buildings and facilities.  These new buildings and facilities will be added to its inventory, and will fall under this requirements contract with the same pricing, terms and conditions applying to them.  GSA also removes buildings from its inventory from time to time.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought
<DESC>North American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI). The Department of Energys, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is seeking interest from companies to write a specification for NASPInet, a network composed of Phasor Gateways, a Data Bus and a set of common services. The vision of the North American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI) is to improve power system reliability and efficiency through wide-area measurement, monitoring and control. This is a Sources Sought notice. This is a market research tool being used to determine the interest of qualified small and large business sources. NETL IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN RECEIVING INPUT FROM SMALL BUSINESSES WHO CAN PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.   Small business sources must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) relative to NAICS classification 541330 Engineering Services.  Small Business Size Standard is $4.5M. The information provided in response to this notice will be used to finalize the acquisition strategy for this requirement. This notice does not bind the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) to any agreement written or implied. There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this notice, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.    All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this notice.   Any information submitted is strictly voluntary. COMPANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE SUBMITTED. BACKGROUND: NASPIs mission is to create a robust, widely available and secure synchronized data (Synchrophasor) measurement infrastructure for the interconnected North American electric power system with associated analysis, monitoring tools for better planning and operation, and with improved reliability. NASPIs ultimate objective is to de-centralize, expand, and standardize the current Synchrophasor infrastructure through the introduction of a NASPI network (NASPInet) that will be composed of Phasor Gateways, a Data Bus, and a set of common Services. The NASPI data measurement infrastructure currently involves a number of devices, including, among others, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs). PMUs are the source of synchronized phasor data.  They are located in the field at a utility substation, receiving station, or generating station.  They may be a stand-alone piece of equipment or a function embedded within another type of equipment, such as a microprocessor-based relay or a Disturbance Fault Recorder.  All PMUs require a highly accurate clock signal for referencing, a sampling/measurement front end, and some sort of communication link to output synchrophasor data. Phasor measurement data is typically transmitted continually from a PMU to a PDC.  PDCs are generally located in the utility office environment, although they could physically be located in the field.  PDCs function as an aggregation point for data from one or more PMUs that is streamed in via communication links to the field.  Some local storage may be present along with an administrator interface and possibly some visualization tools.  Todays PDCs were not designed to support the scalability and flexibility required to meet NASPIs mission. Data retrieval and handling devices are installed by North American utilities within their own company guidelines and infrastructure.  Data from these devices is currently sent to centralized data gathering locations, e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority, Bonneville Power Administration, where data is then made available for authorized distribution as required. Phasor Gateways will be a utilitys portal through which Synchophasor data will be published and subscribed.  A Phasor Gateway may handle data directly from a PMU, but most likely will send and receive data from one or more PDCs. The Data Bus will transport data from one Phasor Gateway to another.  The Data Bus is one logical entity, but it will be comprised of a large number of components throughout the NASPInet, much like the Internet has network-level routers deployed everywhere the Internet is accessible. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: Technical requirements for the development of the specification for NASPInet effort are delineated as follows: The Phasor Gateway specification shall address: scalability, fault tolerance, availability, industry-standard protocol support, vendor interoperability, traffic flow management, failure mode & event notification, data & task logging, naming conventions, access control, cyber security, multi-cast capability, open API feature, support and training. The NASPInet Data Bus specification shall address: data bus access, forwarding latency, throughput, cyber security, traffic prioritization, network utilization, flexibility and heterogeneity, quality of service, temporal synchronicity, instrumentation, anomaly resilience. The NASPInet system-level behavior shall address: naming conventions, protocols, service classes, quality of service, cyber security, emergency modes, trust management, open standards and vendor diversity, instrumentation, data standards and formats, policy-based control, phased implementation approach. HOW TO RESPOND TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: Please submit comments no later than February 22, 2008.     Preferred media is electronic copies in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat.  Preferred method of submission is via email to Angela.Bosley@netl.doe.gov.  Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. Potential sources that possess capabilities to perform the aforementioned technical requirement are encouraged to respond to this sources sought notice and provide the following information: 1)  Statement of Interest to include company name, address, phone number, DUNS number, and identify the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; 6) service disabled veteran owned small business, or 7) large business.

<SUBJECT>A -- SyNAPSE Proposer?s Day Workshop
<DESC>Special Notice SN08-16, SyNAPSE Proposer's Day Workshop; DATE:  March 4, 2008; REGISTRATION DEADLINE:  February 28, 2008; TECHNICAL POC:  Dr. Todd Hylton, DARPA/DSO; Email:  Todd.Hylton@darpa.mil; URL:  www.darpa.mil/dso; Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/ 

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics (SyNAPSE), DARPA is hosting a Proposer's Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team.  The workshop will be held on March 4, 2008, in Reston, VA.

The goals and milestones of the DARPA SyNAPSE program will be specified in an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement. Briefly, the vision for the anticipated DARPA SyNAPSE program is to enable electronic neuromorphic machine technology that is scalable to biological levels.  As compared to biological systems, today's intelligent machines are less efficient by a factor of one million to one billion in real world, complex environments.  The key to achieving the vision of the SyNAPSE program will be an unprecedented multidisciplinary approach that coordinates aggressive technology development in the following technical areas:  1) Hardware; 2) Architecture; 3) Simulation; and 4) Environment.  Hardware includes neuromorphic electronics with novel, high density, plastic, synaptic components; Architecture includes neuromorphic design from microcircuits to complete system; Simulation includes large-scale digital simulation of neuromorphic circuits and functional neuromorphic systems; and Environment includes virtual training, testing and benchmarking for neuromorphic systems.  These technology areas as well as the overall goals and milestones of the anticipated program will be addressed at the SyNAPSE Proposer's Day Workshop and will also be described in an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement.  The SyNAPSE Proposer's Day Workshop is intended to facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the anticipated SyNAPSE BAA. 

The teaming and information session will be held at the Sheraton Reston, 11810 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20191, (703) 620-9000, on March 4, 2008 from 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM.  The specific goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) to introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the SyNAPSE program vision and goals; (b) to explain the mechanics of a DARPA Program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) to encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the SyNAPSE program goals.  The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the teaming and information session participants.  Additionally, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/SyNAPSETeaming/index.asp.

Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas, which will be detailed in an anticipated future BAA, will be critical to the success of the program.  DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of the technologies listed in the BAA.  Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to any future DARPA SyNAPSE solicitation. 

SyNAPSE Proposer's Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session.  Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging information are given on the SyNAPSE registration website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=561.

There is no fee for the SyNAPSE Proposer's Day Workshop. Registration is limited by the venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended.  (No more than 2 attendees per organization may attend the morning presentation sessions.  One (1) additional attendee per organization is permitted at the afternoon poster session.)  Those who are only attending the afternoon poster session are not required to perform an online workshop registration.  The registration cutoff date is February 28, 2008, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  Further administrative information is available from Mr. Robert Allen (Robert.Allen.ctr@darpa.mil).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Todd Hylton (Todd.Hylton@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the SyNAPSE Proposer's Day in your correspondence.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) technical acceptability which is pass/fail (step 1); (2) technical quality of the product (step 2); and (3) price. 

The Government will perform a two-step evaluation. In step one, the initial evaluation will ensure that the sample is in compliance with the stated requirements (e.g., made in the USA, location of the embroidery, correct color of the shirt). Any sample not meeting the stated requirements will be found technically unacceptable. Samples meeting step one will then be tested for quality. Quality testing is defined as a durability test. Testing will take three days and will consist of each shirt being worn for one day, then washed, worn a second time for one day, washed, worn a third time for one day, and finally washed a third time. Wash and wear evaluation will be on the lack of shrinkage, minimal fading, the look of the embroidery, the look of the imprint (for each white shirt) and the samples overall durability after three wearing and three washings. Quality ratings will be provided as Excellent, Very Good, Satisfactory (Acceptable), Poor (Unacceptable). 
Note that delivery of all items must be within 30 days of award of each delivery order (not of the IDIQ).

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.

BASIS FOR BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
250 E. Street, SW, Washington, D.C.  20219

2.  Nature/Description of Action:   This is a limited source, brand-name justification for the procurement of Cisco Router hardware.

3.  Description of Required Supplies and Services:  The procurement of Cisco Router hardware.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:  10 U.S. C. 2304 (c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.303-1

5.  Demonstration of Brand Name Products? Unique Qualification or Nature of Acquisition:

The solicitation that resulted in the award of TCC-05-HQ-G-0074 to Apptis (CISCO reseller) contained the following statement:

?Advisory: It is the intent of the Office of the comptroller to standardize on the make and models that are selected for award of this delivery order.  This means that any future competitive purchases, beyond what is covered by the resulting delivery order, in the next 7 years, for the area of the OCC that is supported by this equipment, will be made on a specific make and model (or upgrades/replacement models) basis consistent with what was acquired under the delivery order resulting from this RFQ.?

This requirement is for CISCO routers, hubs, switches, and related equipment which is required to support the OCC?s Internet Infrastructure and requires standardization pursuant to the language above.  To procure non-standardized equipment would result in a substantial duplication of cost, as it would require a reprocurement of much of the OCC?s existing hardware.

6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.
  
This requirement will be posted on FBO as full and open subject to limitation as a HUBZone set-aside pursuant to FAR 6.205.

The Contracting Officer will make a separate determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of the price.
	
8.  A description of the market research conducted and (See FAR Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: 

Market research was conducted to ensure that there were at least two HUBZone vendors who had the capability and likelihood of responding to an RFQ for the Cisco routing equipment which is the subject of this requirement.  No further market research was necessary, as the provision of any non-brand name items would lead to a substantial duplication of cost.

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: NA

10.  A listing of sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the Acquisition: NA

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition:  NA

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations and Conference Space, located in (order of preference) ONE of the following locations:  San Antonio, TX or San Francisco, CA area. Request for Proposal VA-777-08-RP-0096 is in accordance with FAR Subpart  12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.   This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)   This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through  FAR Fac 2005-23, Effective 25 Jan 2008 and VAAR 97-10.

A Hotel Contract shall be submitted with your proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, menus.   To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm and also on the Central Contractor Registration website (www.ccr.gov).

In addition, the offerors facility must be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336) (42 U.S.C. 12101 et. Seq.).   The hotel facility must accommodate an estimated 400 attendees with the following needs:   Part A:  Hotel Lodging - 400 sleeping rooms for participants arrival on Monday,  May 12, departure on Thursday, May 15, 2008.

<DESC>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program Office (HPCMP) is sponsoring a Performance Modeling and Prediction Workshop, to be held on 21-22 February 2008, in Lorton, VA.  This workshop is to familiarize the HPC vendor community with the performance modeling methodology that is being considered for use in analysis and performance predictions in the upcoming TI-09 HPC procurement activity and to provide feedback to TI-08 HPC vendors on performance predictions for their systems.  The workshop is constructed as a half-day general session on the morning of 21 February that will consist of a review of the performance prediction methodology and its potential uses in TI-09 evaluation, followed by individual sessions on the afternoon of 21 February and the morning of 22 February with TI-08 vendors and vendors interested in TI-09 to present individual TI-08 performance prediction data to vendors and further discuss the proposed TI-09 methodology.

It is important that each HPC offeror that is interested in submitting a TI-09 proposal participate in the workshop, including the offeror's technical staff involved in benchmarking and performance modeling; this workshop will present a technical approach to performance modeling and provide offerors an opportunity to provide technical feedback on this approach.  Note that eligible TI-09 offerors must be original equipment manufacturers who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 ?General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services?; (2)  have demonstrated success in large scale manufacturing, delivery and acceptance of commercially available, production HPC systems; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.  Potential offerors meeting the above criteria that are interested in attending the Performance Modeling and Prediction Workshop should contact Mrs. Deborah E. Joeckel, General Services Administration, no later than 8 February 2008.  Please send an email to deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov, and provide the name of your company, a primary POC with email and phone number, and names of those targeted to attend.  Each potential offeror should plan to send no more than three persons from their company.  Participation in this workshop does not require a security clearance.  A separate FedBiz announcement initiating the TI-09 acquisition will be published on or about 18 February 2008.  The TI-09 Phase I RFQ will be released to pre-qualified offerors on or about 21 April 2008.
