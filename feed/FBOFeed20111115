<p>a) To the FDA's knowledge Ex Libris is the only company that offers software maintenance for the ILS modules FDA is currently using (Aleph, SFX, Metalib, and Verde).</p>
<p>b) Any delay in service would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541511. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A solicitation will be issued to Ex Libris (USA) Inc. no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines otherwise. All written inquiries must be submitted to Syntoria Spencer, Contract Specialist, via email at syntoria.spencer@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), Wednesday, December 1, 2011.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics (LCE), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Pennsylvania State University, 103 Shields Building, University Park, PA, 16802, to provide the following services, as outlined below.
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2012-023-DDC.</p>
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The Imaging Physics Lab of the Biophysics and Biochemistry Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NHLBI) has developed the design of a multilayer-coated micro grating array (MLMGA) for hard x-ray phase-contrast radiography and computed-tomography (CT). Phase-contrast CT holds the promise to dramatically improve the visibility of soft tissue structures and reduce radiation exposure to patients when compared to conventional absorption contrast CT. The essential component of phase-contrast CT is x-ray absorption and phase gratings. How small the grating periods are determines how sensitive the system is to minute phase shifts in tissue. Up-to-date, lithography fabrication techniques have not been able to achieve grating periods below 1 micrometer, due to the prohibitively high aspect ratio of the vertical structures. NHLBI developed a solution to overcome the grating period limitation. The solution is in the form of an array of micro gratings on a staircase substrate, where each step is coated with multiple bi-layers of a high and low atomic number material (e.g., tungsten and silicon). Each step acts as a micro grating. This design allows submicron to nanometer grating periods with unlimited aspect ratio, and large grating areas when continuity condition between the steps are met. <br />There a several significant differences between the multilayer coating of MLMGA and those of conventional multilayer x-ray or conventional light optics. First, MLMGA requires uniform deposition on one surface (floor surface) of a staircase substrate and minimal deposition on the other surface (side wall); Secondly, the total thickness of the multilayer stack in MLMGA needs to be tens of micrometers as opposed to nanometers in conventional multilayer x-ray optics, or a few microns in light optics; Third, the individual layer thickness of MLMGA will be equal to or greater than 50 nanometers, which is orders of magnitude thicker than conventional multilayer x-ray optics; Lastly, the interface sharpness and smoothness in MLMGA is less crucial than in conventional multilayer x-ray optics.<br />Because of the above specifications, a high rate and directional coating technology is required for multilayer deposition in MLMGA. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) is a technology that potentially meets the requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement<br />The overall objective of this procurement is to obtain multilayer coatings of tungsten/silicon bi-layers and molybdenum/silicon bi-layers on patterned silicon wafer substrates. The coatings will meet specifications described below, which will be sufficient to be used as gratings of a prototype phase-contrast microCT scanner. The silicon substrates will be provided by Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR). The staircase pattern on the silicon substrates will have individual steps of approximately 28 micrometer height and 35 micrometer diagonal width. The precise dimensions of the substrate pattern will be provided to the Contractor by COTR.</p>
<p>The final specifications on the multilayer coatings are</p>
<p>1. The multilayer coating consists of a stack of bi-layers of identical thickness. Each bi-layer consists of two material layers of equal thickness. The material combinations will be tungsten/silicon and molybdenum/silicon. <br />2. The total number of bi-layers will be close to or equal to 141, or a number mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and COTR based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor.<br />3. The total thickness of the multilayer should match the step height of the staircase pattern to within 10% of the bi-layer thickness. Equivalently, the thickness of an individual bi-layer should be set to the height of an individual step of the staircase divided by the total number of bi-layers (N), and the error in the average thickness of the bi-layers should be within 0.1/N of this target bi-layer thickness. Randomly fluctuations of the bi-layer thickness should be within 0.5% of the target thickness. <br />4. Deposition on the side walls of the staircase pattern should be minimized. Deposition on the floor surfaces of the staircase pattern should cover most of their width.<br />5. Adhesion of the multilayer coating to the substrate should be sufficient to avoid any spontaneous delamination or detachment from the substrate.<br />6. The multilayer coating shall be uniform over an area of 3.0 cm by 3.0 cm, or an area that is mutually agreed upon between COTR and the Contractor based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor, to provide for a sufficiently large field of view in the prototype microCT scanner. COTR will provide substrates that have patterned areas larger than 3 cm by 3 cm to facilitate meeting this specification.</p>
<p>The contract will be fulfilled in three phases as outlined in the next section.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements<br />The Contractor is required to have EB-PVD facility capable of deposition rates of 200 nm/min or higher, prior experience in multilayer coating of similar material combinations and dimensions as described in the final specifications in the "Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement" section, and expert knowledge of the stresses, layer thickness control and adhesion quality of multilayer coatings of similar material combinations and dimensions as described in the final specifications. Contractor will perform on a reasonable best effort basis each Phase of the contract with the aim of reaching each deliverable. During each Phase, it is anticipated that the Contractor will fabricate a number of trial coatings on substrates that are supplied by COTR, while making various technical adjustments and optimizations. The trial coatings will be evaluated by the Contractor and by COTR with light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and any other inspection tools that may be necessary. The Contractor and COTR will communicate to the other party the evaluation results. Based on the evaluation results, the Contractor will discuss with COTR possible adjustments for successive trials. The Contractor shall not proceed to the next phase until the COTR has approved the submitted accepted deliverables.</p>
<p>Phase I<br />The objective of Phase I is to fabricate tungsten/silicon multilayer of the required total thickness and individual bi-layer thickness in a limited area on the patterned substrate. To accomplish Phase I, at a minimum, the Contractor shall deliver to COTR a tungsten/silicon multilayer-coated sample that meets all of the following specifications in a part of the patterned area:<br />1. The multilayer coating consists of a stack of bi-layers of identical thickness. Each bi-layer consists of a layer of tungsten and a layer of silicon. <br />2. The total number of bi-layers will be close to 141, or a number mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and COTR based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor.<br />3. The total thickness of the multilayer should match the step height of the staircase pattern to within 10% of the bi-layer thickness. Equivalently, the thickness of an individual bi-layer should be set to the height of an individual step of the staircase divided by the total number of bi-layers (N), and the error in the average thickness of the bi-layers should be within 0.1/N of this target bi-layer thickness. Randomly fluctuations of the bi-layer thickness should be within 0.5% of the target thickness. <br />4. Deposition on the side walls of the staircase pattern should be minimized. Deposition on the floor surfaces of the staircase pattern should cover most of their width.<br />5. Adhesion of the multilayer coating to the substrate should be sufficient to avoid any spontaneous delamination or detachment from the substrate.</p>
<p>Phase II <br />The objective of Phase II is to fabricate tungsten/silicon multilayers that meet all specifications in the "Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement" section, including the dimensions of the layers and uniformity over a large area. To accomplish Phase II, at a minimum, the Contractor shall deliver to COTR three tungsten/silicon multilayer-coated samples that meet all of the following specifications:<br />1. The multilayer coating consists of a stack of bi-layers of identical thickness. Each bi-layer consists of a layer of tungsten and a layer of silicon. <br />2. The total number of bi-layers will be close to 141, or a number mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and COTR based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor.<br />3. The total thickness of the multilayer should match the step height of the staircase pattern to within 10% of the bi-layer thickness. Equivalently, the thickness of an individual bi-layer should be set to the height of an individual step of the staircase divided by the total number of bi-layers (N), and the error in the average thickness of the bi-layers should be within 0.1/N of this target bi-layer thickness. Randomly fluctuations of the bi-layer thickness should be within 0.5% of the target thickness. <br />4. Deposition on the side walls of the staircase pattern should be minimized. Deposition on the floor surfaces of the staircase pattern should cover most of their width.<br />5. Adhesion of the multilayer coating to the substrate should be sufficient to avoid any spontaneous delamination or detachment from the substrate.<br />6. The multilayer coating shall be uniform over an area of 3.0 cm by 3.0 cm, or an area that is mutually agreed upon by COTR and the Contractor based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor, to provide for a sufficiently large field of view in the prototype microCT scanner. COTR will provide substrates that have patterned areas larger than 3 cm by 3 cm to facilitate meeting this specification.</p>
<p>Phase III <br />The objective of Phase III is to fabricate molybdenum/silicon multilayer coatings on the same substrate as the tungsten/silicon multilayer coating. To accomplish Phase III, at a minimum, the Contractor shall deliver to COTR three tungsten/silicon multilayer-coated samples that meet all of the following specifications: <br />1. The multilayer coating consists of a stack of bi-layers of identical thickness. Each bi-layer consists of a layer of molybdenum and a layer of silicon. <br />2. The total number of bi-layers will be the same as the total number of bi-layers in the tungsten/silicon multilayers accomplished in Phase II.<br />3. The total thickness of the multilayer should match the step height of the staircase pattern to within 10% of the bi-layer thickness. Equivalently, the thickness of an individual bi-layer should be set to the height of an individual step of the staircase divided by the total number of bi-layers (N), and the error in the average thickness of the bi-layers should be within 0.1/N of this target bi-layer thickness. Randomly fluctuations of the bi-layer thickness should be within 0.5% of the target thickness. <br />4. Deposition on the side walls of the staircase pattern should be minimized. Deposition on the floor surfaces of the staircase pattern should cover most of their width.<br />5. Adhesion of the multilayer coating to the substrate should be sufficient to avoid any spontaneous delamination or detachment from the substrate.<br />6. The multilayer coating shall be uniform over an area of 3.0 cm by 3.0 cm, or an area that is mutually agreed upon by COTR and the Contractor based on results from coating trials performed by the Contractor, to provide for a sufficiently large field of view in the prototype microCT scanner. COTR will provide substrates that have patterned areas larger than 3 cm by 3 cm to facilitate meeting this specification.<br /><br />Contract Performance Period<br />The Government anticipates award date of December 5th 2011. Period of performance of the contract is anticipated to be 6 months with an ending date of May 4th 2012.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>Provide the Contractor details of the desired multilayer architecture;<br />Provide the Contractor the substrates for coating and all relevant information about the substrates;<br />Communicate to the Contractor the results of sample inspections within a minimum of 5 business days after receiving the samples from the Contractor; <br />Discuss with the contractor ways to optimize the multilayer coating process.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control<br />The Contractor shall have regular communication with COTR at least once a week by telephone, email or video conferencing for the purpose of keeping both sides up-to-date on the status of the coating trials and inspection results of coated samples. Note: If at 50% completion of any current Phase, the Contractor determines that the results of the current Phase cannot be achieved the Contractor shall notify the COTR immediately.</p>
<p><br />Reporting, Deliverable Requirement and Payment<br />The Contractor shall, on a reasonable best effort basis, perform each phase of the contract outlined above. COTR anticipates that the Contractor may need to perform multiple trial coating runs in each Phase of the contract before meeting the minimal requirement. The Contractor will deliver to COTR the coated samples of each batch of trials when they are available, and communicate with COTR the results of inspections they have done.</p>
<p>The coated samples and a copy of invoices shall be delivered to the COTR:</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute), 10 Center Drive, Building 10-Room B1D416, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.</p>
<p><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Biochemistry and Biophysics Center (BCBPC) mission is to develop non-invasive imaging technologies for the benefit of biomedical applications. A current focus of our program is phase-contrast x-ray imaging. This is a new class of x-ray imaging techniques that holds the promise of substantially enriching the information content in radiography and CT. As part of this effort the Government is looking for multilayer x-ray optics of the type that is detailed in the specifications. <br />In March and May of 2011, preliminary coating trials were performed for COTR, by two other laboratories and Penn State. Of the three results Penn State was technically superior both in the multilayer structure and in the speed of the coating run. To further assess the feasibility of such coatings, COTR solicited for competitive bids to perform trial coatings. An award was issued to Penn State to perform 5 - 7 trial coatings. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to continue services with Penn States for the finish product, and not compete, the contract to avoid jeopardizing outcome of this research.<br /><br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, engineering, and Life Sciences with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does not apply to this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 29, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. These services will be acquired in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. AE services are required for two (2) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for commissioning services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Silver Spring, MD.
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Western Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as other NOAA locations in the Pacific including: America Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas Islands, Republic of Palau and Wake Island.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Eastern Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Washington D.C., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of commissioning services is to ensure existing and new facilities are provided with properly designed and energy efficient systems prior to facility acceptance. Additionally commissioning services ensure the staff is provided with proper systems documentation, receive adequate training, and understand proper maintenance procedures. The services sought under this contract include a selected range of Architectural and Engineering (AE) services for commissioning, re-commissioning, and other engineering services to DOC/NOAA building systems. In this context, "systems" refer to systems and equipment to be evaluated or commissioned and will be further defined under each issued Task Order (T.O.). The best qualified firm will be selected to provide commissioning support services in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering, including but not limited to, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and controls, plumbing, seawater systems, laboratory fume hood exhaust systems, fire alarm and protection systems; electrical engineering, including but not limited to, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), emergency generator, radio systems, fire and burglar alarm systems; energy efficiency audits; life cycle cost analysis; value engineering; building control and automation systems; lighting systems; building systems; specialty items, including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV); and environmental engineering, including but not limited to storm water management, site utility studies, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) certification, site investigation and analysis. A general knowledge of other technical disciplines (e.g., architectural and geological) could be required to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>NOAA and its Line Offices have ongoing and continuous requirements to commission newly constructed buildings, and to re-commission existing buildings. Before a newly constructed building is accepted by DOC/NOAA, various building systems, in particular its energy systems, such as HVAC, emergency generators, and Automatic Transfer Switches, are commissioned (i.e., tested for functionality, and in the case of HVAC, efficiency is measured, and air flow rates tested and balanced). Typically, a few weeks after a successful commissioning inspection, the building is declared suitable for beneficial occupancy, and DOC/NOAA takes possession of the building. Because new facilities are being added to DOC/NOAA's inventory each year, the demand for commissioning services is required continuously.</p>
<p>Similarly, when an existing building's HVAC system, or its controls are significantly upgraded or replaced, the HVAC system is usually re-commissioned prior to accepting the work as complete.</p>
<p>The Government shall seek the most highly qualified firm. Cost will not be used as an evaluation criteria for offers.</p>
<p>Under the IDIQ contracting scheme mentioned above, the upper limit of the 5 year life of each of the two (2) contracts will be less than $4,500,000.00. The minimum guaranteed amount will be no less than $100,000.00. Each Task Order (T.O.) under this contract will have its own negotiated cost.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must have a sufficient number of personnel knowledgeable and current with the responsibilities of a commissioning agent, as described in the latest LEED standards for New Construction. The successful offeror must have on his staff, and provide resumes for: <br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agents with expertise in HVAC systems and controls, plumbing, emergency generators, and automatic transfer switches, and demonstrated ability to perform well as an on-site inspector, especially in the role of a commissioning agent;<br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agent with expertise in electrical systems, lighting systems and controls, telecommunications and alarm systems, and experience serving as a commissioning agent or in support of a commissioning agent;<br />The above personnel should be willing to travel anywhere there are DOC/NOAA facilities, based on project schedules requiring commissioning services. Additional personnel with commissioning experience, and depth of experience of all personnel, shall be taken into account during the selection process.<br />The successful offeror must also have additional staff to provide other areas of expertise as required, including the ability to design and/or replace systems found to be inadequate.<br />This IDIQ contract will be issued for a period of 5 years. During this time, the offeror must continue to provide excellent services.<br />The present IDIQ commissioning contract expires on March 14, 2010. The projected performance period of this acquisition is expected to be May 2010 - May 2015. <br />The successful firm must be able to perform work anywhere within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories, though it is expected that most work will occur in the region related to their award, as stated above.</p>
<p>The minimum ordering limitation for this contract shall be $10,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation shall be $1,000,000.00 for any single task order in a given calendar year. <br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this action are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>A. Demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience in performing a full range of commissioning services, including examples of specialized experience in the commissioning of newly constructed buildings, conducting energy audits and HVAC studies and related analysis and design, supporting a LEED submittal as a third party commissioning agent, and the re-commissioning of a commercial building after HVAC controls have been replaced.</p>
<p>B. Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to this commissioning contract, with emphasis on commissioning experience and professional certifications and licenses for key personnel, including consultants and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>C. Recent past performance on Federal Government projects, requiring commissioning services similar to those described in the Scope of Work.</p>
<p>D. Demonstrated capability to provide recommendations and work efficiently and constructively with other AE firms and contractors when deficiencies are discovered.</p>
<p>E. Demonstrated plan and capacity of the firm to manage multiple concurrent projects across the country.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall be required to confirm they satisfy all of the following requirements to be eligible to contract with the Government:</p>
<p>1) Provide evidence of a current Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) record.<br />2) Provide evidence of a current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record documenting size status and other socioeconomic qualifications.<br />3) Provide evidence of a current "Vets 100" registration.<br />4) Provide evidence of financial responsibility, capacity, and capability to perform the project.</p>

Please feel free to use either site to accesss information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a sole source bridge contract to Electric Boat Corporation (EB), 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340, for the services and ancillary supplies required to staff and operate a Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD) at SUBASE, New London, CT.
 This level-of-effort contract will require project management, engineering and planning, training, inspection and nuclear services, and ancillary materials in support of operational nuclear submarines including maintaining and modernizing facilities and equipment and providing off-hull support of submarine nuclear maintenance. Personnel must be certified to work inside all designated nuclear spaces of submarines to perform nuclear-related actions as required by NAVSEAINST 4350.2C and COMFLTFORCOMINST 4790.3. Work in support of the Naval Submarine Support Facility (NSSF) under NRMD is performed inside nuclear and SUBSAFE work boundaries. Contractor personnel require a working knowledge of nuclear and SUBSAFE work boundaries, policies, and directives.
 Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company's shipyard in Groton, CT. The dynamics of submarine force operation require an NRMD contractor capable of meeting workload surges and shifting skill requirements on a daily basis. This effort requires an NRMD contractor to be a nuclear qualified shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London, capable of meeting the NRMD requirements. The period of performance will be from 1 April 2012 through 30 September 2012 with two three month options possible from 1 October 2012 through 31 December 2012 and 1 January 2013 through 31 March 2013. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact EB directly.

<DESC>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially and government available equipment (COTS/GOTS) or near-commercial technologies that may be used for E911 services and capabilities at government installations, both within the United States and around the world.  This sources sought is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of E911 services (E911 SERVICES) for fielding in the fiscal 2012. The information obtained by this sources sought will be included in a market study that will be coupled with an evaluation process to determine what system or systems should be recommended for inclusion in and Emergency Management  solution set.
<p>We are interested in information on systems that would be usable for integrating with multiple E911 SERVICES vendors to provide a layered approach to E911 services.  Specifically, we are looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently deployed systems with respect to proven capability to integrate with other vendors and an example as to where this capability has been deployed. Operational issues, specifically mean time between failure rates, scalability, and interoperability, are of particular interest.  Other issues that might impact operations, such as IP  requirements, radio frequencies approvals, civil construction, network approvals, and calibration, reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.</p>
<p>Of key interest is the capability for dispatch center operators to automatically receive and utilize the telephone number and address of the caller to decrease overall emergency response times for data collection at the dispatch center and information transfer to first responders.</p>

This sources sought is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of Common Operating Picture Software/Systems (COPSS) for fielding in FY 2012.  The information obtained by this sources sought will be included in a market study.
<p>We are interested in information on software/systems that would be usable for integrating with multiple COPS vendors to provide a layered emergency management approach to COP.  Specifically, we are looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently deployed software packages/systems with respect to proven capability to integrate with other vendors and an example as to where this capability has been deployed. Operational issues, specifically mean time between failure rates, security, availability, scalability, and interoperability, are of particular interest.  Other issues that might impact operations, such as IA requirements, network approvals, updating of software (timeliness and costs), reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.</p>
<p>Of key interest is the ability, of the software, to pass on information from the incident site, incident command post and emergency operations centers internally and to transmit specific information externally when required.  This information would consist of the below listed software's/systems' capabilities.  These capabilities could include but not be limited to the following:<br />&bull;	Situation Awareness<br />&bull;	Models to Support Decision Making<br />&bull;	Interoperability and Integration with Mass Notification Systems i.e. Giant Voice, Telephone Alert Systems, and Network Alert Systems<br />&bull;	GIS (Geographic Information System)<br />&bull;	Scalability<br />&bull;	Certification or Approval (IA and otherwise)<br />&bull;	Alignment with Homeland Presidential Directives (HSPD) 5 &amp; 8<br />&bull;	Interest is also in both desktop and laptop software versions, if applicable.</p>

The size standard for this code is $33,500,000.00.   <br><br>The acquisition will be conducted under a competitively negotiated source selection process.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The acquisition strategy is Best Value "Tradeoff."  This process allows for a trade-off between non-cost factors and cost/price and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award.  In making the tradeoff determination all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. It is the Government's intent to award based on initial offers without discussions. Offerors are therefore cautioned to provide their best terms for both price and non-priced technical submission with their initial offers.    Evaluation factors may consist of the following:  Construction Experience; Past Performance on projects similar in nature; Key Personnel; Project Management Plan.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive.<br><br>All offerors are advised that this project may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and/or final award process.<br><br>Downloading the Solicitation:  The solicitation will be available on or about 29 December 2011.

If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package.  The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-8 and  52.219-9 and AFARS 19.705.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (cite http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm)</p>
<p>To achieve its mission, the Agency conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotes improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, comparative effectiveness, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of the generation, synthesis, and dissemination of scientific evidence, including effectiveness research and analytic methods.</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has been designated by Congress as the lead federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for patient safety. AHRQ's reauthorization language specified that the Director of the AHRQ "shall conduct and support research and build private-public partnerships to:<br />&bull; Identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery;<br />&bull; Develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and<br />&bull; Disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry."</p>
<p>The goal of patient safety improvement is to reduce injury or harm to patients from healthcare. Patient safety can be improved by eliminating or minimizing unintended risks and hazards. In the process of identifying risks and hazards AHRQ needs to employ multiple methods to fully understand the degree to which patient injury occurs in U.S. hospitals. AHRQ has determined that it is essential to continue the operation of the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS) to provide accurate and reliable data on inpatient injury. MPSMS will also be more completely integrated into the overall patient safety improvement mission of the agency.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the MPSMS is to produce rates of hospital associated adverse events from medical records and clinical data. The focus of the system is on adverse events occurring during hospitalization primarily using abstracted medical records. These rates are produced at the national level for all measured adverse events. In addition, rates for adverse events of sufficient frequency will be produced at a State level. For the purposes of this project, adverse events are defined as unintended, measurable harms associated with healthcare. The major cost to AHRQ associated with MPSMS is the cost associated with the chart abstraction. The system is used by AHRQ and other Federal agencies to guide and prioritize the development and implementation of patient safety interventions and safe practices.</p>
<p>AHRQ has also been authorized by statute to develop common definitions and reporting formats (Common Formats) covering the domains of quality and safety for use by Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) and other interested parties. AHRQ has an established process for the development of Common Formats that includes the involvement of AHRQ's Patient Safety Work Group (PSWG) and the National Quality Forum (NQF). This contract will begin the process of aligning MPSMS with AHRQ's Common Formats. This alignment will involve collaboration and consultation with AHRQ's PSWG and the NQF Common Formats Expert Panel.</p>
<p>The November 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report - To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, highlighted the significance of the patient safety problem in our healthcare system. The November 2010 report of the HHS Office of Inspector General, Adverse Events in Hospitals: National Incidence Among Medicare Beneficiaries, used different methods than the IOM, but found that 13.5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries experienced adverse events during their hospital stays. Recent data from MPSMS also has shown that patient safety problems persist at a similarly high rate. It is clear that accurate and dependable national data on specific adverse events and the overall rate of adverse events is needed. MPSMS is able to provide this data for the nation.</p>
<p>Under AHRQ, MPSMS has provided high quality data for 2009, and data for 2010 is currently being generated. National rates on combined adverse events and HAIs have also been generated by analysis of MPSMS data and reported in the NHQR and NHDR. The feasibility of producing additional years of MPSMS data, with many of the same features and with some enhancements is very high.</p>
<p>Starting with 2009 data, the primary data source for MPSMS is medical records from hospitalized patients selected from the records collected from hospitals by CMS as part of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting System (formerly named the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update [RHQDAPU]). The patients are from four groups: pneumonia patients, heart failure patients, acute myocardial infarction patients, and patients whose records are included in the analyses associated with the Surgical Care Improvement Program (SCIP). A maximum of about 8,500 records from each group are available, and records are taken from approximately 800 hospitals at the rate of 12 records per quarter. Patients in each group can be of any age not less than 18 years old. For future years, additional patient groups are being added by CMS to the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting System sample, and will therefore be available for analysis using MPSMS.</p>
<p>Multiple Federal agencies have collaborated to build MPSMS. The HHS agencies include: CMS for project coordination through 2007, conceptual development, measurement issues, and data collection; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adverse events associated infections; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adverse events associated with drugs and devices; the AHRQ for research coordination and overall management. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have also both contributed to the program from their perspective as large providers of healthcare services throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Improving patient safety involves redesigning health care systems to either prevent harmful events, or, if the events cannot be prevented, to mitigate the severity of their harm to patients. The adverse event rates produced in the MPSMS have and are expected to continue to help us build successful interventions to better focus and prioritize our future patient safety improvement efforts. Specifically, and consistent with surveillance system principles, tracking these adverse events systematically overtime can be expected to improve patient safety in several ways:<br />&bull; Provide us with a description of the general distribution of adverse events among inpatients at the national level, and for more frequent adverse events, describe their distribution at the state or regional level.<br />&bull; Inform our planning of patient safety programs for hospital inpatients by providing information on adverse events to better inform our interventions to either prevent errors or to mitigate their effects. <br />&bull; Inform us regarding the effectiveness of national, regional and statewide prevention programs implemented to improve patient safety for inpatients, and <br />&bull; Alert us to any unexpected increases of adverse events all patients or among subgroups of patients.</p>
<p>In addition, the MPSMS also provides a unique opportunity to further the science of measuring adverse events among inpatients through the validation of existing measures and the development of new and better measures and systems.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br />The purpose of this procurement is to build the basic AHRQ Quality Standards &amp; Safety Reporting System ("QSRS"), an expandable software platform to permit the collection, analysis, and reporting of specified patient safety and quality of care data. The initial version of this platform will replace the current CMS Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System software ("MPSMS"); for an overview of this system please see the following link: http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/advances/vol2/Hunt.pdf.</p>
<p>This initial version, while including elements of MPSMS, will incorporate a broader taxonomy of adverse event reporting and surveillance to allow reporting of harms from all causes - "all cause harm" - and to allow use of the system by an individual hospital as a surveillance tool to detect adverse events in medical records. This broader approach will provide for alignment of findings from continued Federal-level (MPSMS-type) review with review being carried out by individual hospitals, and Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), that follow the AHRQ Common Formats.<br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is looking for firms which have the capability to develop software to analyze data abstracted from medical records for patient safety and healthcare quality information and experience with development of standardized definitions, data elements, and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting.</p>
<p>AHRQ is seeking qualified firms able to optimize their technical and management resources, creativity, and flexibility to satisfy the requirements of this procurement. Qualified firms must demonstrate substantial experience with development of software to analyze data abstracted from medical records and experience with development of standardized definitions, data elements, and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting beyond data contained in the medical record. Organizations that work at the national, state, regional, local or provider levels that are engaged in these tasks are encouraged to participate in this offering.</p>
<p>Qualifications include:<br />&bull; A minimum of 3 years experience working healthcare data analysis.<br />&bull; A minimum of 3 years experience in software development.<br />&bull; Demonstrated evidence of a minimum of 3 years experience in development of databases adhering to Federal IT security standards.<br />&bull; Corporate experience with healthcare quality and/or patient safety initiatives citing experience over the past 3 years, with evidence of knowledge, experience, and infrastructure related to health care quality and/or patient safety related activities.<br />&bull; Corporate expertise in the following competency areas: analytic data capacity; statistical, methodological and healthcare quality and patient safety measurement expertise, managing subcontracts and consultants, and writing user-friendly, technically accurate reports and documentation.<br />&bull; Experience developing software in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p>The capability statement should demonstrate the organization's ability to complete the requirements of this procurement. Sources must possess, or be able to obtain the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed above. Capability Statements should include information on partners or other organizations that firms would propose contribute to this project.</p>
<p>Capability statements should be no more than 5 pages in length and should include the respondents' DUNS #, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Capability statements must be submitted in hard copy format (1 original plus 2 copies) to the attention of Jessica Alderton, Contracting Officer at 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850 no later than 12:00 PM EST on November 30, 2011.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">Synopsis:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">The Department of the Air Force ("the Air Force") requests an expression of interest from prospective entities (developers, contractors, teams, consortiums, joint ventures, etc.) capable of developing, designing, owning and operating a biomass energy generation project at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi. The Air Force seeks information regarding potential construction and operation of a biomass project in terms of an operating agreement parties would require in order for parties to fully analyze and make proposals for the opportunity, as well as questions and concerns market participants might have. Please see the list of questions below. The Air Force will consider other approaches to this business opportunity and respondents are encouraged to submit alternative business models to improve the return to the Air Force. Please submit any questions or additional information you would like included in a solicitation, should this project proceed.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">Background:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">The Air Force is considering the merits of leasing up to 2 parcels with a total of 120 acres (map attached) of non-excess land for a 20 megawatt (MW) biomass project on the installation.</p>

This parcel is subject to Federal Aviation Administration height restrictions that preclude development of biomass systems that rely on tall structures (i.e., over 150').<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This site is located in the 100 year floodplain and has two closed environmental restoration sites totaling 4 acres.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Site 2 has access to Barton Ferry Road, and is located approximately 1 mile east of the Tombigbee River.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>TVA operates one transmission line adjacent to the second parcel, which leads to the installation's primary substation at the south gate.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">A detailed transmission study will be required to more accurately assess transmission impacts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Preliminary discussions with TVA indicate interest in obtaining power from this project through the Renewable Standard Offer program (<a href="http://www.tva.gov/renewablestandardoffer">http://www.tva.gov/renewablestandardoffer</a>); however the developer would need to submit an application to their program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is anticipated that an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) would be accomplished under authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, authorizing the Secretary of the Air Force to out-lease non-excess real property for no longer than 50 years.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">Expression of Interest Desired:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 12pt">The Air Force requires that in exchange for a long-term lease of federally owned land for the biomass energy generation project, the Air Force would receive cash or in-kind consideration equal to or greater than the fair market value of the asset. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Columbus AFB currently does not anticipate purchasing any power generated from the biomass energy generation project discussed within.</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Air Force expects all expressions of interest to be commercially funded and financially viable ventures with associated commercial risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In all cases, the Air Force would not develop, design, own, operate, or be the licensee for the biomass energy generation project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<ARCHDATE>12152011
<CONTACT>Jennifer R. Begg, Phone 9375222277, Email Jennifer.Begg@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)</strong>
<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing polarimetric hyper-spectral imaging(HSI) capability in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). Firms responding shall specify that their equipment meets the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality.</p>
<p><strong>The specific technical requirements of this polarization hardware (PH) are as follows:<br /></strong>&nbsp;&bull; Shall be compatible with Telops, Inc. Hyper-Cam.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The PH must enable the collection of HSI data between 8-12 &micro;m in two orthogonal polarization states, hereafter denoted H for horizontal (0&deg;) and V for vertical (90&deg;).<br />&nbsp;&bull; The PH substrate must be a non-hygroscopic material.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The extinction ratio of the PH must be 300:1 or better between 8-12 &micro;m. For example, the throughput of V-polarized light must be a factor of 300 less than H-polarized light when the PH is in the H position.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The transmission efficiency of the desired polarization state must be greater than 70% between 8-12 &micro;m.<br />&nbsp;&bull; Selection of the H or V polarization state must occur with an accuracy of 0.1&deg;. For example, H = 0.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg; and V = 90.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg;.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The H or V polarization angle must not fluctuate more than 0.1&deg; during data acquisition.<br /><br />These research projects require calibrated polarimetric HSI data collected under challenging field (non-laboratory) conditions. To expedite field data collection and reduce probability of data acquisition mistakes, the polarizing hardware (PH) must be fully integrated into the instrument. In addition to the specifications above, the following requirements pertaining to its operation within the existing Telops Hyper-Cam instrument and associated control software must be met:<br /><br />&nbsp;&bull; The PH must have a clear aperture of at least 71 mm to enable use of the Hyper-Cam's full entrance aperture.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The PH must be placed behind the Hyper-Cam's on-board blackbody calibration sources to ensure the effects of the PH are accounted for during instrument calibration.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The PH must be removable by the end-user so that non-polarimetric HSI data can still be collected with the upgraded LWIR Hyper-Cam.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that specific polarization states (e.g., horizontal and vertical) can be selected using the graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, the GUI must indicate which polarization state (H or V) is currently active.<br />&nbsp;&bull; The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that the specific polarization state (e.g., horizontal or vertical) is stored in the header file of each raw polarimetric HSI data cube.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested equipment to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates; and the number of employees does not exceed 500. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 333314. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.). <br /><strong><br />Capabilities package:</strong> All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales-and product specifications related to this effort. Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: Jennifer.Begg@wpafb.af.mil in a Microsoft word compatible format or mailed to ASC/PKOAA POC: Jennifer Begg, 1940 Allbrook Dr., Rm 109, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433-5309 to be received no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 22 November 2011. Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Jennifer Begg at Jennifer.Begg@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Engine Water Wash <br />Industry Day Notification<br />(Follow up to RFI FA8124-11-R-0010)
<p>This Industry Day Notification is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.</p>
<p>Description of services</p>
<p>The Air Force requires engine turbine water wash services at 34 CONUS bases and 2 OCONUS bases (i.e., Eielson AFB, AK and Hickam AFB, HI. Initially, the Air Force will focus wash service on F108-100 (KC-135), F108-201 (T/RC-135), TF39 (C-5), and TF33-103 (B-52), TF33-5/9 (O/WC-135), TF33-100 (E-3B), TF33-102C (E-8) engines with expansion to other pylon-mounted engines (e.g. F134 (C-5). The annual wash rate is expected to be approximately 1,000 engines for all engines at the associated aircraft main operating base or the respective maintenance location (i.e., isochronal maintenance, phase inspections, and program depot maintenance (PDM)).</p>
<p>An Engine Water Wash consists of a closed loop, on-wing engine water wash to adhere with environmental regulations at the aforementioned 36 USAF bases. Water solution used must not harm the engine, nor leave any substantial residue (e.g. de-ionized solution). The vendor will perform the wash at the CONUS USAF bases with minimal support from base resources (material and manpower). The wash system must be mobile to avoid aircraft movement and able to wash 4 engines within a 4 hour period. The wash is expected to reach the turbine area of the engine, demonstrate no adverse effects to an engine at start up speed, effectively clean the turbine area, leave no residual, and gather all residual debris from the wash.</p>
<p>Government will provide access to the aircraft, prepare engine for wash and post wash requisites. USAF crews will open cowl doors, perform any aircraft mechanical preparation required for engine wash, motor engine for engine wash process, perform post-engine wash ground run, as required to dry engine, close cowl doors, and restore engine to operating condition per applicable aircraft procedures. The vendor will provide all manpower and equipment to accomplish an engine water wash.</p>
<p>Industry Day Details</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NNA12EDM002LThis RFI is a market survey for information to be used for planning purposes only.  Thepurpose of this RFI is to obtain information from industry on potential systems,processes, and products that will achieve calcium compound removal from concentratedurine to below solubility limit to prevent scale formation.NASA intends to lease or procure a Electrodialysis Metathesis System for water recoverysystem on board the International Space Station (ISS).	One of the objectives of this work plan is to evaluate the electro dialysis metathesis(EDM) process for the removal of calcium scale precursors from urine. Operation of theInternational Space Station (ISS) urine processor assembly (UPA) has demonstrated thatcalcium scale can be a limiting factor to achieving high water recovery ratios.  Theurine generated on ISS has a high potential for calcium scale formation due tomicrogravity initiated bone loss from astronauts and the use of sulfuric acid as apretreatment.  As a result, the ISS UPA has operated at reduced water recovery ratio inorder to prevent the precipitation of calcium scale.  Examples of scale forming calciumsalts: calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate. The need to resupply water to ISS can beaddressed by mitigating this calcium scale problem and increasing the water recoveryratio of the UPA. This can be accomplished by removing the calcium and its ionicconjugates from solution. The EDM process may be developed as a method to remove calciumfrom solution and prevent its precipitation as calcium scale.  The development of thistechnology also allows for the development of a new generation of spacecraft wastewatertreatment systems which are designed specifically to deal with precipitated scale formingsolids.This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subjectto FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for PlanningPurposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it is not to be construedas a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government payfor the information submitted in response to this request.  This procurement is subjectto review or cancellation at any time.	The NAICS code planned for this procurement is 334516; the small business size standardis 500 employees. The schedule, method of solicitation, type of contract, set asidepotential, selection criteria, pricing structure, and other considerations to be usedwill depend on the NASAs analysis of the responses received from this RFI.NASA is presently familiar with the capabilities of Veolia Water Solutions EDM withcapability for zero discharge desalination (ZDD), and seeks this or equivalent equipmentto fulfill this need.We request industry experts to provide any information, solutions, or product offeringthat will meet NASA's requirements.  System Characteristics:The system may incorporate an electro dialysis cell consisting of multiple compartments.The following is an example of possible system configurations that NASA seeks. The electrodialysis-metathesis cell module may have a capacity of individually-placed ionexchange membranes: 3 cation exchange membranes and 2 anion exchange membranes. The cellmodule should have 2 electrodes: anode and cathode. The 2 cation exchange membranesshould be placed in a vicinity of electrodes. The assembly should allow easy membranereplacement with a possibility of replacement of electrodes to test various membranes andelectrodes. The room between membranes should have optimized spacers, also with apossibility of easy spacer replacement. The stack assembly should have seals that providepositive sealing. Each membrane compartment shall have inlet and outlet ports forprocessed liquids: two compartments for rinsing of electrodes, one compartment for feedstream, one compartment for replacement ions solution (for example, NaCl), twocompartments for processed liquids consisting exchanged ions. The total number ofcompartments in this example: 6. The compartments will consist spacers that facilitateliquid flow and separate ion exchange membranes.The proposed configuration may be a square or rectangular stack, tubular or other compactgeometry. The materials selection: the materials should be compatible with the product of highlyconcentrated salt solutions and acidic (pH2) conditions. The product stream is highlyconcentrated urine at about 80% of water removal level. Other streams would haveparameters as used in metathesis.The active cross section areas of electrodes and ion exchange membranes should providesystem capacity of approximately 5 L per hour. The anion and cation exchange membrane life span should be approximately the same underoperational conditions.Operational:The example of scale-forming calcium compound is calcium sulfate. Its concentration needsto be maintained at a level below the precipitation threshold (the solubility is verylow, at about 2.6 g/L at ambient temperature and decreases at elevated temperatures). Complete removal of CaSO4 may not be necessary.No water splitting (gas release) should occur. No excessive temperatures are allowed(operation at ambient temperature; need for external cooling shall be avoided).Optimized  (minimal) power use is desirable.System should be able to handle particles in the processed liquids (design ofcompartments, spacers and ports).We are looking for all pertinent information including rough order of magnitude forpricing, product lead time for delivery, and any information believed to be helpful inour market research and in determining industry capabilities.  Desired lead time fordelivery is 60 days after award of any contract or order.Responses to this RFI must include the minimum following information:  Company name,address, contractual and technical points of contact, phone number, e-mail, and website(if applicable), number of years in business, and name of parent company if applicable. Also required is information about the vendors business size (i.e., large, small, smalldisadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, etc.) ,whether the firm is under a GSA Schedule Contract for this product, and which industriesdoes the vendor identify itself with in the North American Industry Classification System(NAICS).  Detailed requirements for the acquisition have not been finalized, nor have the specificsfor the acquisition strategy been determined.  NASA intends to use the results of itsmarket research to aid in the making of these final decisions.	The objectives of thisRFI are: to provide industry with preliminary information regarding this potentialacquisition, solicit information about potential sources and ROM pricing estimates, toidentify the capabilities of small business and other business classifications to performthe work, and to invite potential offerors to submit comments regarding the fulfillmentof this requirement.Responses to this RFI are due by 4:30 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday, November 23, 2011. Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements, suggestions,schedule/ price ROM estimates, as well as any comments on the acquisition approach(email only) to: Elizabeth A. Baierl, Email:  elizabeth.a.baierl@nasa.gov.  Responses arelimited to twenty (20) pages in length, not including cover letter, cover page, and tableof contents.  Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Officesoftware applications.Following this initial feedback, NASA may conduct one-on-one meetings with potentialcontractors.  These meetings will allow for exchange of information and will provide anopportunity for potential offerors to provide feedback on the Governments requirementsand its acquisition approach.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Internet site for therelease of any future information about this acquisition. Potential offerors will beresponsible for downloading their own copy of any future documents.  Information will beposted on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browserapplication.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) supports a market survey being conducted by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR) to determine potential sources for a Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS). TCAPS headsets serve three purposes: First is to provide clear two-way audio communications via earphone and microphone. Second is to provide protection from high ambient noise; both continuous type (vehicle noise) and impulse type (gunfire and explosions). Third is to provide talk-through capability for verbal conversation and ambient sounds to preserve auditory situational awareness in low noise environments. This specification does not include bone conduction microphone (including throat band types) or bone conduction speaker designs.<br><br>The Tactical Communication and Protective Systems (TCAPS) specification will serve as the requirements document and the Government's framework for verification testing of candidate systems. Systems that meet or exceed these requirements through a combination of third party Contractor testing and Government testing will be made available through a qualified product list for the US Army. This RFI will help the government to gain an understanding of whether or not industry is capable of producing systems in accordance with the attached performance specifications.<br><br>Respondents shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. <br><br>Please submit specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified above and expanded upon in the attached document.<br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a response which supports the company's claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.

<DESC>Sources Sought: <br><br>This is a Sources Sought Announcement (SSA).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this SSA is to obtain knowledge and information on manufacturing capabilities within the United States for project and acquisition planning purposes.<br> <br>Background:<br><br>Joint Product Director - Protection (JPM-P) has overarching responsibility for the research,  development, design, and acquisition of mobile, transportable shelters that provide collective protection (COLPRO) against the effects of chemical and biological (CB) agents.  COLPRO shelters typically provide protection for missions such as tactical operation centers, field hospitals, and areas of rest and relief from the burden of wearing individual protection.  JPM-P has a number of existing and planned programs for COLPRO shelters, such as the CB Protective Shelter (CBPS) and the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Family of Systems.<br><br>Purpose and Objective:<br><br>The objective of this SSA is to identify potential suppliers of closures or closure systems for COLPRO shelters. Closures typically fall into several categories including but not limited to:<br><br> 	conventional zippers (slide fasteners)<br> 	water/vapor tight zippers<br> 	zippers with over flaps<br> 	hook and loop fasteners<br> 	zip-lock track closures<br> 	push to seal closures<br><br>Closures on COLPRO shelters may be used to create doorways or to allow for the modular connection of liners and outer shell components or the connectivity of complete shelters, passageways or air locks.  Passive COLPRO shelters (i.e. non-powered filtration) require vapor/liquid resistant closures with impermeable or selectively permeable properties. Active (over-pressured) COLPRO systems can utilize closures with limited permeability. This SSA includes all of these categories, as well as any new or novel concepts.  <br><br>This SSA is for domestically manufactured closures; closures used in DoD procurements must eventually meet the requirements of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation System DFARS Sub Part 225-7002.  Closures that do not contain textile components may not be affected by this regulation. <br><br>Capability statement /information sought:<br><br>Respondents may at their option provide a capability statement "White Paper" or alternatively, existing marketing or technical product brochures that describe the capability of their closure for the intended COLPRO functions. "White Papers" shall be limited to four (4) pages; accompanying or alternative product literature shall be limited to twelve (12) pages. This SSA seeks existing products that are at a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 8 or above. However, products that are at a MRL of 6 or 7 will be considered.<br>Responses may be sent via email to thomas.larkham@us.army.mil, or via regular mail to U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Command, ATTN: RDNS-STF (Thomas Larkham), 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5018 or via Facsimile at (508) 233-5112.  Responses are requested by 30 December 2011. <br>Disclaimer and Important Notes:<br><br>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.<br><br>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.<br><br>Confidentiality:<br><br>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).<br>

<DESC>Statement of Work<br />2013 Private Sector Collection Activity<br />For Student Related Debts<br /><br />1.1 INTRODUCTION<br />The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Federal Student Aid, performs collection and administrative resolution activities on debts resulting from non-payment of student loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program: Stafford Loans (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan Program and including Federally Insured Student Loans), Supplemental Loans for Students, PLUS Loans (formerly Parental Loans for Undergraduate Students), and Consolidation Loans; the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program (formerly known as the Federal Direct Student Loan Program): Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program, Federal Direct Consolidation Loan, and Federal Direct Plus Loans; and Federal Perkins Loans (formerly National Direct/Defense Student Loans). ED conducts similar collection and administrative resolution activities on debts resulting from a student's failure to fulfill grant requirements under the Pell Grant Program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, the Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG) and the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (National SMART) grant. [Background information on each of these programs may be found in the website library - http://fsacollections; or at http://ifap.ed.gov.]
<p>Since 1981, ED has contracted for the services of Private Collection Agencies to support collection and administrative resolution activities on debts maintained by ED. Under this Task Order, the Contractor shall:<br />&bull; Perform duties in coordination with the ED Service Centers. The Service Centers are: Washington Service Center, 830 First Street, NE, Washington, D.C.; Atlanta Service Center, 61 Forsyth Street, Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago Service Center, 500 W. Madison Street, Suite 1520, Chicago, Illinois; and San Francisco Service Center, 50 Beale Street, San Francisco, California.<br />&bull; Establish within ninety (90) calendar days of Task Order award, administrative and collection office(s) dedicated exclusively to the collection and resolution of ED accounts.</p>
<p>The collection office need not be located at the same site as the administrative office. The administrative office must also function as a liaison office between ED and the Contractor. Meetings between the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Assistant Contracting Officer's Representative, the monitor and the individual Contractor may take place either in the Contractor's administrative office, their collection office, any subcontractor or satellite office, or any ED designated Office. The Contractor may, at its option, establish additional collection offices (referred to as a satellite-collection office) at any time during the Task Order period; however, the Contractor must incur the cost of the additional telecommunication line(s). These satellite-collection offices must conform to all applicable requirements set forth in the contract and Task Order. The same Contractor employee shall maintain direct management control over both the primary office and the sub offices. Only one administrative office must service these offices. The Contractor shall obtain the COR's approval before opening a satellite office. <br />&bull; Accept and return account data for collection by electronic file transfer in the specified formats provided by ED. (see ED's Default Management Collection System Manuals contained within the PCA website "Library" - http://fsacollections)<br />&bull; Establish and maintain computer software and hardware which can accept and accommodate data on all ED accounts, be updated on a daily basis, and provide the information specified in this Statement of Work. The Contractor shall generate Billing Statements through the ED System. The Contractor shall generate all letters through their computer system and transfer to the ED System letter history screen via secure electronic file transfer (EFT). Access to all ED account data must be restricted to the collection and resolution activities on ED accounts exclusively.</p>
<p>Adhere to all ED security requirements as outlined in the Departmental Directive, Handbook OCIO-01, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy, including any future revisions, and any other ED specified security policy documents; maintaining, at the Contractor location, the same level of security for all ED account data as is maintained on ED's system.<br />&bull; Obtain an Authorization to Operate (ATO) from the Federal Student Aid Chief Information Officer prior to 10/3/09. ED will provide checklists and templates, which must be completed by a third party reviewer. The checklist and templates are based on NIST 800-53 requirements.<br />&bull; Establish a training program for each loan program and related ED campaigns and initiatives to encompass the complete range of collection activity specified in this Task Order. This program must include comprehensive initial and follow-up training of Contractor and subcontractor employees relative to the activities to be performed and the laws and regulations, which govern such activities received.<br />&bull; Provide a mailbox to receive ED correspondence, exclusively, at a U.S. Post Office located in the area of the administrative office, and pick-up correspondence received at this box at least once each workday.<br />&bull; Perform activities in strict adherence with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations in a professional and courteous manner; and support the mission of the ED/Collections, which is to: "Provide quality customer service and sound credit management to maximize net revenue".<br />&bull; Provide facilities, equipment and perform actions necessary for large-scale nationwide collection of Federal Government debts.<br />&bull; Locate and contact borrowers to demand payment of their debts to the Federal Government, or otherwise resolve their debt.<br />&bull; Prepare eligible cases for administrative resolution, Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) and litigation, based on the criteria in the Task Order, and meet established goals set by ED. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining documentation in accordance with administrative resolution procedures [as outlined in the Procedures Manual], or as requested by ED, and the forwarding of all such materials upon request.<br />&bull; Return all accounts and associated records, accompanied by all required documentation, to ED within timeframes specified in the Task Order, as outlined in the Deliverable Section.<br />&bull; Protect the Federal Government against loss of monies and loss of or damage to property.<br />&bull; Agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Federal Government harmless from all liability, loss, damages, claims and other expenses, including attorney's fees and court costs, originating from or in connection with the Contractor's performance under this Task Order.<br />&bull; Take all necessary steps, as warranted, by each State or locality to insure that it is operating within the laws of the jurisdiction except insofar as Federal law supersedes these requirements, as specifically directed or approved by ED in the collection of monies owed to the Federal Government. This includes meeting all applicable State-licensing requirements, including the successful completion by Contractor employees of any State mandated exams prior to the first placement of accounts. ED anticipates face-to-face meetings three or four times per year coordinated by either ED or the contractors at a designated location within the continental United States. ED will also hold periodic update/training meetings. Registration fees may be required of participants. Contractors are responsible for their travel expenses to the meetings and periodic update/training meetings.<br />&bull; The Contractor, in connection with other collection efforts involving the same borrower under any other contract, shall not access related data on ED accounts. More specifically, no information relative to an ED account may be exchanged or consolidated in any medium with information regarding the same borrower from another Federal agency, school, etc.<br />&bull; The contractor shall adhere to all terms, conditions, and requirements set forth in the SOW and any ED policies and procedures established in conjunction with this contract. Failure to follow these requirements may lead to ED taking administration action. Potential penalties for specific issues may include, but are not limited to, loss of commission/fees, recalling of accounts, withholding account transfers, loss of bonus funds, staff removal, and/or termination of Task Order.<br /><br />1.2 GENERAL ACCOUNT CHARACTERISTICS<br />The general characteristics of the portfolio, as of December 31, 2007, having a balance (principal, interest, penalty fees, fees, administrative costs) of $500.00 or more are available in the PCA website library (http://fsacollections). ED does not guarantee that these numbers and values will precisely reflect the accounts eligible for transfer. They are presented as general portfolio characteristics.<br /><br />1.3 LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING COLLECTION ACTIVITY<br />Collection activity on debts held by the Department of Education is authorized and regulated by a number of different statutes and regulations, including those listed here. The Contractor is required to conduct its actions in a way that complies with these Federal and State laws. Failure to do so may result in immediate punitive measures and/or termination of the Task Order. -- Title IV, Parts A through G of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1070 - 1098d.) and implementing regulations (34 CFR Parts 668, 674, 682, 685, 690and 691); <br />&bull; The Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR Parts 901-904).<br />&bull; The Bankruptcy Code, as amended (11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), especially sections 362(a) and 523(a)(8)(B).<br />&bull; The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).<br />&bull; ED Debt Collection Regulations (34 CFR Parts 30, 31, and 34).<br />&bull; Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, as codified at 31 U.S.C. 3701 - 3720E. -- The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq, and, as required by 31 U.S.C. 3718, State law regulating collection actions except where such State law is preempted by Federal law. <br />The Secretary of Education has statutory authority to contract for Collection services under section 430(b) of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1080(b) and 20 U.S.C. section 1087hh(e)(4)), and the Department of Education Organization Act of 1980 (20 U.S.C. 3475).<br /><br />1.4 TRANSFER OF ACCOUNTS<br />ED's initial transfer will be 15,000 accounts to each large business contractor and 5,000 accounts to each small business contractor no earlier than 90 days after Task Order award, upon successful implementation of the deliverables as outlined in Section 5.1 Task Order Deliverables. Though ED has the final determination on all transfer amounts, the first several transfers may be level until the CPCS Performance measures are initiated (See Section H.5). In addition, the first several account transfers after the competitive period formally begins, may contain base pool transfer amounts for each agency, along with, competitive percentage transfer amounts.<br />ED has performed at least minimum collection activity on all accounts. ED will not distinguish an account by the number of times it has been placed with a collection agency until such time as a new system is implemented, which can track and make commission payments based on number of times placed. ED will not make transfers based on the default date of the loan. The only common characteristic is that each account will be categorized as delinquent. Any minimum balance criteria (principal, interest, penalty fees, fees, administrative costs) will be at the government's discretion.<br />Additional account transfers will be based on contractor performance and evaluations conducted by ED. Failure to achieve a level of performance that falls within the "performance range" may result in no additional account transfers to poor performers until performance within the performance range is achieved. [Description and timing of evaluations to be conducted in determining contractor performance can be found in Section H.5.]</p>
<p>1.4.1 INVENTORY CONTROL LIMITS<br />A Contractor may, at its discretion, request a limit on the number of accounts that it wishes to accept ("inventory control limit"), under the following conditions: <br />&bull; By the 10th--The Contractor must send its request to set an inventory control limit on the next transfer to the COR and Assistant COR no later than the 10th of the month. <br />&bull; Reason--The Contractor must state the reason it wishes to cap its transfer volumes at this time<br />&bull; Other conditions set by COR--The COR may establish in writing additional limits or conditions related to Inventory Control Limits at any time during the performance of the Task Order.<br />ED has the final authority on all account transfers and recalls. ED expressly reserves the right to approve, deny or change any Contractor request to set an inventory control limit. Regardless of whether a Contractor has requested an inventory control limit, ED may limit transfers to a Contractor for any reason. <br /><br />1.4.2 ED TRANSFER LIMITS<br />ED reserves the right, at any time, to limit the number of accounts transferred to a Contractor. <br />For example, the COR's Office may issue a policy indicating that ED will not transfer a volume of accounts greater than 50% of the contractor's CIA. If ED withholds "earned" accounts from a transfer, ED will carryover the number of accounts not transferred and will add those to the "earned" account transfer volume at the next transfer. This process will be repeated with each transfer until the carryover has been eliminated.</p>
<p>2.1 IMPLEMENTATION<br />In implementing their collections program, the Contractor shall establish an operational system to store ED account records on its own computer system; establish the technological ability for ED to remotely access the Contractor's collection computer system (supplying any software, hardware, and connectivity) and providing any necessary training to ED on the Contractor's collection system at the Contractor's expense finalize procedures relating to the transfer of accounts, reports and other information between ED and the Contractor; prepare a Collections Training Manual and a Standard Operating Procedures Manual (including letters and forms that will be generated from the Contractor's collection system); and finalize a Quality Control Plan for use by Contractor and subcontractor personnel. The Contractor must complete these requirements prior to the first transfer of accounts.</p>
<p>After the initial account transfer, the Government shall perform an initial review - Contract Implementation Evaluation (CIE) - with all Contractors or those Contractors meeting certain established review criteria (e.g. new ED Contractors, former small businesses moving up to the unrestricted classification, etc.) in order to assess system related operations, the interface between the Contractor's computer system(s) and the ED-System, and the administrative interface between the Contractor and ED. ED reserves the right to conduct on-site and/or off-site reviews with each Contractor under the most appropriate method based upon review criteria and with an effort to maximize all available resources. <br /><br />2.2 TRAINING<br />The Contractor's Collection Training Manual, Standard Operating Procedures Manual (that must include all Industry abbreviations in use by its collections), and the Quality Control Plan must be approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and Assistant Contracting Officer's Representative.</p>
<p>ED will provide training on appropriate ED Procedures to the Contractor's Training Staff. Thereafter, the Contractor's Training Staff shall train all other Contractor employees and conduct regular training sessions for its employees and any subcontractor employees to ensure adherence to applicable laws, regulations and ED policies. The Contractor shall conduct additional training to inform its employees and any subcontractor employees of all changes in operational procedures, laws or regulations as they are modified or updated. The Contractor shall also provide State and locality debt collection-related training to the employees, including the successful completion by Contractor and subcontractor employees of any State-mandated exams.</p>
<p>Each employee and subcontractor employee assigned to this Task Order must receive training relevant to the <br />Privacy Act of 1974 and Security Awareness, and shall certify, in writing, that they have received this training before <br />they begin any collection activity on ED accounts. .) Each employee must then re-take this training each year by July 15. Signed certifications must be forwarded to the address below within five (5) calendar days after completion of training along with an excel spreadsheet with the employee's name, SSN, Training date and Sent date. (After the Task Order award, ED will provide the certification form to be signed by each employee and subcontractor employee along with the excel format)</p>
<p>Attention: Privacy Act Certification Team<br />61 Forsyth Street SW<br />Room 19T89<br />Atlanta, GA 30303</p>
<p>The Contractor shall measure the effectiveness of the training by administering post-training tests. The COR and Assistant COR may review the results to ascertain the need for additional training and testing. A certification form for all training provided in support of this Task Order must be signed by each Contractor and subcontractor employee and maintained on file by the Contractor. Along with certifications, the Contractor must record (electronic spreadsheets, tracking forms, etc.) all training provided to Contractor employees or subcontractors by individual names, training topics, and dates of training. The Contractor shall make certifications and all training records available for Government review at the request of the CO, COR, assistant COR or ED Monitors.</p>
<p>The Contractor may request site visits for technical assistance and/or training. The Contractor will be responsible for travel costs incurred for requested technical assistance and/or training site visits. Proposed costs must be consistent with the most current Government per diem rates for lodging and meals. The PCA Training Manual may be referenced for additional information relative to request procedures. All payments by the Contractor for site visit costs must be made to the Government (E.g., the Contractor may not make payments to a hotel or a Federal employee).<br />A schedule of all update training conducted during the month and a brief synopsis of the subject matter covered in each training session must be included in the Contractor's Management and Fiscal Report.</p>
<p>2.3 QUALITY CONTROL<br />ED is committed to quality control as a means of ensuring quality performance and achievement. The Contractor shall also adopt this philosophy and, to that end, shall design a quality control plan and, upon final approval by the COR, shall implement the plan. To monitor and provide contractor oversight, one on-site review, along with periodic off-site reviews, may be performed annually. The reviews may be announced or unannounced. If significant instances of non-compliance are found, potential compliance concerns exist, or if changes are made by the Contractor or ED that may affect performance in accordance with the Task Order, follow-up or additional compliance reviews may be conducted. The reviews will focus on compliance with federal regulations, Task Order and contract requirements, policies, etc. Agency Review Reports, including any findings, and corrective actions, will be issued at the completion of each review. All areas of the ED collections Contract are subject to review and all finding/concerns must be resolved. Penalties for specific issues may include, but are not limited to, loss of commission/fees, recalling of accounts, withholding account transfers, loss of bonus funds, staff removal, and/or termination of Task Order.</p>
<p>2.3.1 REMOTE CALL MONITORING <br />All Contractors shall provide ED the capability to remotely monitor Contractor "collection calls" on all ED accounts.</p>
<p>"Unrestricted" contractors shall provide ED the capability to remotely monitor all "collection calls" by accessing automated call recordings of collection calls through a secure web-based portal.</p>
<p>"Small Business" contractors shall provide ED the capability to remotely monitor all "collection calls" through accessing the agency phone system; however, "Small Business" contractors shall provide ED the capability to remotely monitor all "collection calls" by accessing automated call recordings of collection calls through a secure web-based portal within 2 years of the Task Order award.<br /><br />ED will use remote phone monitoring and call recordings to perform compliance reviews of collection activities, assess call quality on ED accounts and monitor individual collectors in reference to complaints. The Contractor must inform all parties that calls will be recorded and/or monitored for quality review purposes.</p>
<p>For ED purposes, "collection calls" refer to any out-going or in-coming calls related to any collection activity on an ED account. Collection activities include, but are not limited to, request for payments, administrative resolutions, ED loan payment programs, administrative wage garnishments, skip tracing, verifications, etc.</p>
<p>Remote call monitoring through recorded calls must include all "collection calls" regardless of account, subject or duration&not;&not;. Other requirements include:<br />&#61607; Storage of up to 90 days worth of calls<br />&#61607; Ability to retrieve specific calls by day or by individual contractor staff <br />&#61607; Recorded calls must be afforded the same protection as any other ED sensitive borrower data.</p>
<p>Remote call monitoring through agency phone systems must allow ED monitors the ability to listen to individual contractor staff or randomly listen to the next available call.</p>
<p>Remote call monitoring (phone system or recorded calls) applies to the primary ED contractor (includes all satellite offices). If a primary contractor (small or unrestricted) uses a subcontractor to perform "collection calls," the primary contractor must be able to remotely monitor the subcontractor collection calls at the start of the subcontract award; and, must be able to record all subcontractor collection calls within 2 years of the subcontract award.</p>
<p>Agencies must provide any training, manuals, procedures, etc. necessary for ED staff to utilize the agency's remote call monitoring or call recording system. <br /><br />2.4 RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS<br />ED will maintain a Complaint Tracking System that will include both verbal and written complaints. ED will track by agency, individual collector, and nature of the complaint. When ED has received one or more complaints for a collector of a type or violation that is a concern to ED, the Contractor shall, upon notification, immediately remove that collector from the ED Task Order. When the subject of any complaint is a concern to ED, the COR/Assistant COR will notify the Contract Administrator to immediately cease the activity causing the concern. If there are complaints regarding this activity after the Contract Administrator has been notified, a two (2)-point reduction in the next quarterly CPCS score will occur. <br />Contractors shall adhere to all complaint procedures required by ED. At a minimum, complaint procedures will encompass time frames, proper documentation, and notification requirements. Please see the PCA Procedures Manual for more detailed information.<br /><br />2.5 COLLECTION LETTERS/FORMS<br />The Contractor shall obtain ED's approval of all collection letters and forms used by the Contractor, and/or generated from the Contractor's own computer system, prior to usage. The Contractor shall also obtain ED's approval with regards to any changes made to collection letters/forms. Contractor attorneys must approve all ED agency letters/forms (and any changes) prior to submission to ED and proof of acceptance by the Contractor legal counsel must be provided to ED along with the letter submission. Any letter requesting repayment from the borrower must be generated with a coupon. The specifications for this coupon will be provided after Task Order award. The Contractor shall transmit to ED on a weekly basis the letter history to include any return mail as outlined in the document "Standard Letters and Forms," which ED will provide after Task Order award. <br />If changes and or corrections are needed on contract letters and the Contractor has been notified to make the changes, the Contractor must have all changes/corrections made and submitted, along with proof of Contractor legal counsel approval, to the ED contact person for review and approval within 30 days. If the Contractor does not comply with this timeframe, transfer of accounts will be withheld until the letters are approved. The Contractor must provide a final production copy of all approved letters to the ED contact person, COR, Assistant COR and Monitor within 10 calendars days after notification by ED that the letters have been approved. <br /><br />2.6 DOCUMENTATION OF COLLECTION ACTIVITY<br />The Contractor shall immediately record, on its own computer system, all collection activity occurring on an account, including, but not limited to, - documentation of all in-coming and out-going calls; complete, clear, accurate summaries of phone conversation; clear correspondence receipts and deliveries; etc.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall update the ED-System with borrower's name, address, home and work telephone number changes and information regarding the borrower's employment, i.e., employer's name, address and telephone number. Reference the Procedures Manual for transmission mechanisms, security constraints and other specific data of inputs required by the ED-System.<br /><br />2.7 REPAYMENTS<br />The Contractor is strictly prohibited from soliciting the receipt and processing of payments under this Task Order. The Contractor is also prohibited from soliciting post-dated checks. ED's Lockbox will not accept post-dated checks. Reference the Procedures Manual for instructions relative to this subject.<br /><br />2.7.1 Credit Cards<br />Any contractor that processes credit cards/debit cards for accounts under this Task Order shall abide by all credit card securities and requirements as outlined by ED and contained in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The Contractor is responsible for the security of any cardholder data it maintains or possesses. <br />(See Section 6.2 for additional security requirements)<br /><br />2.8 CORRESPONDENCE<br />Routine: The Contractor shall process routine incoming correspondence within ten (10) calendar days of receipt. Correspondence must be received, and maintained at the Contractor's administrative office. Correspondence must be retained at the administrative office when the collector is located at the sub office. Correspondence includes all documentation received pertaining to a "current" borrower account. Documentation received on accounts no longer placed with an agency will be forwarded to an ED designated site (see PCA Procedures Manual for specific correspondence requirements).</p>
<p>Other: Other incoming correspondence as outlined in the PCA Procedures manual must be referred to ED within one (1) business day. See Procedures Manual for detailed instructions.<br />Contractors shall have the ability to image, electronically store and produce viable copies (legible, same format as original document) of all incoming correspondence and, if requested by ED, can send electronically secure imaged documents.<br />Unless otherwise stated in the Task Order, under the GSA Scheduling Contract or specifically instructed by ED, agencies must retain account information for the life of the contract. <br /><br />3.1 RESOLUTION OF ACCOUNTS<br />The Contractor shall systematically resolve all accounts transferred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Task Order.<br />The Contractor shall ensure that all attempts to collect on accounts transferred do not involve harassment, intimidation, false, or misleading representation. There shall be no unnecessary communications concerning such debt to persons other than the borrower or the borrower's designated representative. All requests for information from specified third parties, as defined in the PCA Procedures Manual, must be referred to ED upon receipt. (E.g. congressional inquires, etc.)<br /><br />3.2 REQUIRED ACTIVITIES, DOCUMENTATION AND STANDARDS<br />Listed below are the required collection activities to be performed by the Contractor, the required documentation to be obtained by the Contractor, and ED standards to be followed by the Contractor.<br />A. LOCATING AND CONTACTING THE BORROWER<br />Upon initial contact with the borrower, the Contractor's employee shall clearly identify themselves as working for a firm under contract to ED, verify that the borrower's name, address, email address, and telephone numbers are current and obtain employer's name, address and telephone numbers. This information, including all changes, must be updated to the ED-System via the next regular transmission of data.<br />The use of cell phones (personal or business) by regular collection staff to contact borrowers or any third party is expressly prohibited. A limited number of higher-level management may use cell phones to contact borrowers or third parties in special circumstances. A list of managers that a Contractor wants to be able to use cell phones must be forwarded to the COR and Assistant COR for approval. All cell phone calls must be properly documented in the Contractor collection system with the phone number, date, time, employee identification, and call summary. The agency must ensure cell phones are used according to all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding debt collection communications. (See PCA Procedures Manual for more detail) <br />Whenever the Contractor determines that the address last known to ED is undeliverable or the account address record has been coded 'U', the Contractor shall perform skip-tracing efforts. If the Contractor contacts the borrower at an address other than the last address known to ED, the Contractor shall reissue its first demand letter to the borrower at the new address. The Contractor shall process the address update in the next regular transmission of such data.</p>
<p>B. REPAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS<br />The Contractor will attempt to obtain payment in full or settlement. Whenever the Contractor determines that repayment in full is not immediately possible, the Contractor shall negotiate a mutually agreed upon reasonable and affordable repayment schedule employing ED's philosophy relative to repayment recovery of accounts. Generally, repayment schedules should affect resolution of the account within five (5) years or sixty (60) month from the first payment date. The Contractor shall draft and send a "Repayment Agreement" letter (ED will provide Standard Letters and Forms with sample text after Task Order award) to the borrower confirming the payment arrangement which the borrower has agreed to and shall flag the account to receive the ED-System generated monthly billing statement.<br />The Contractor may determine that a borrower wishes to repay the debt but is unable to make the minimum monthly payment amount to pay the debt in full within five years. At that point, the Contractor shall obtain verbal financial information and forward to the borrower a standard financial statement form (See Standard Letters and Forms, Financial Statement, which ED will provide after Task Order award.) The Contractor shall establish a temporary repayment plan based on the verbal information. Once the statement is returned to the Contractor by the borrower, the Contractor shall determine if the temporary repayment plan is supported by the financial data. If not, the Contractor shall negotiate a new repayment schedule. For all non-ED "program" repayment plans (e.g. rehabs, consolidations, etc.), the Contractor shall review the borrower's repayment agreement and current financial status every 6 months to determine if adjustments are necessary.<br />The Contractor shall draft and send a "Repayment Agreement" Letter (See Repayment Agreement Letter sample text in Standard Letters and Forms, which ED will provide after Task Order award.) to the borrower confirming the payment arrangement which the borrower has agreed to and shall flag the account to receive the ED-System generated monthly billing statement.<br />However, if based on the financial information received, it is determined that the borrower is unable to pay, the account should be returned as "INA" (Inability to Pay at Present) at the next prescribed time frame. The Contractor shall also document their collection history as to why the borrower is unable to pay.<br />Gratuitous payments do not constitute an agreed upon repayment arrangement.<br /><br />1. Accounts Eligible for Compromise<br />The following restrictions apply to compromise activities:<br />a) Compromise settlements must not be offered as the first option in collection negotiations.<br /><br />b) Contractor personnel may only discuss compromise settlements after negotiations on the borrower's ability to pay have progressed, and only under those circumstances wherein ED has not forbidden the compromise. Reference the Procedures Manual for instructions relative to this subject. The Contractor, as outlined in Section 4.2 of the Statement of Work, must return all accounts on which the compromise payment is received.</p>
<p>C. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES<br />Periodically, ED performs matches with Federal employee databases and if the account is not in current repayment ED retains the right to recall the account from the Contractor.<br /><br />D. LOAN REHABILITATION AND CONSOLIDATIONS<br />1. Loan Rehabilitation allows borrowers to have their loans (with the exception of loans with judgments) taken out of default, and their credit bureau report updated to reflect a current status. Payments posted to the borrowers account must have accurate effective date information. Any account determined to have the effective date of a payment changed or altered will not be eligible for rehabilitation until the required nine monthly payments within a ten month period have been made by the borrower. . The Contractor shall forward accounts eligible for the monthly rehabilitation sale to ED or ED's designated representative. Required supporting documentation must be attached.<br /><br />2. Consolidation allows the borrower to consolidate all student loan debts with one lender whether the loans are in default or not. The borrower must make the minimum required monthly payments. The Contractor shall complete the lender verification forms (LVC) and update the ED-System screen for accounts eligible for consolidation.<br />The completed lender verification forms will be forwarded to the consolidation lender. Copies of all LVCs, along with screen prints of the ED-System, must be maintained by the Contractor and forwarded to the ED Monitor upon request. The Contractor shall audit 100% of LVCs.<br />See PCA Procedures Manual for more detail. <br /><br />E. DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS<br />An account is considered delinquent when a subsequent payment has not been received by the sixtieth (60) day from the last payment. If the Contractor is unable to convince the borrower to bring his/her account current by the next payment due date, the Contractor shall review the account to determine if it is eligible for one of the following:<br /><br />1. Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG). The Contractor shall determine if the borrower is a candidate for administrative wage garnishment. If the account is eligible, the Contractor shall move the account into the AWG sub-system, or<br /><br />2. Litigation. If the account is eligible, the Contractor shall send to the borrower a notice of intent to litigate. <br />For accounts ineligible for litigation or AWG, the Contractor shall pursue further collection activity.<br /><br />3.3 CANDIDATES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE WAGE GARNISHMENT<br />If during the course of the Contractor's collection effort, the borrower indicates to the Contractor no intention of repaying the debt(s), the borrower is a potential candidate for AWG (for possible Litigation, please see section 3.4 Administrative Resolutions)<br /><br />A. ADMINISTRATIVE WAGE GARNISHMENT (AWG)<br />AWG is an alternative means of enforcing collections of defaulted loans held by ED. ED is authorized to garnish up to fifteen (15) percent of the borrower's disposable salary. The law governing AWG prohibits an employer from discharging the borrower as a result of the garnishment.<br />If during the Contractor's research, it is determined that the borrower has the ability to but no intention of paying, the borrower may be a candidate for AWG. The Contractor shall determine if the borrower is eligible for possible AWG in accordance with ED procedures.<br /><br />3.4 ADMINISTRATIVE RESOLUTIONS<br />The Contractor may determine that certain accounts fall within categories (A) through (G) below. Accounts returned as deaths, disabilities, and programmatic cancellations are eligible for full, non-discretionary write-off of the debt by ED. Also, accounts processed based on Litigation will be counted as an Administrative Resolution. More specific information on all administrative resolutions may be found in the PCA Procedures Manual.</p>
<p>In such situations, the Contractor shall perform the steps indicated for the applicable category and obtain the required documentation. ED reserves the right to modify, change or remove administrative resolutions (including required documentation) if ED determines it is in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>Incarceration processing may be changed with a 30-day notice from the Contracting Officer. At that time, if the contractor finds a borrower who they believe is incarcerated, they may send the borrower data to the Department and request the borrower be removed from their inventory without regard to the length of time the account has been with the contractor.</p>
<p>Accounts recommended by the Contractor for write-off, must be returned by the Contractor by specific categories on Contractor return files or submitted for manual recall by ED.</p>
<p>The Government may designate, in writing, additional types of administrative resolutions (ARs). The Government will designate the number of AR units that will apply to the additional AR type. An additional type of administrative resolution designated by the Government would be for work the Contractor performs that results in:</p>
<p>&bull; Return of an account to the Government for discharge of the debt or for suspension of collection efforts; or<br />&bull; Increased recoveries to the Government on the accounts in the designated category. (In this case, the Government may allow the Contractor to retain the account to continue collection or resolution efforts.)</p>
<p>Administrative Resolutions include:</p>
<p>A. DEATH<br />The borrower's death must be documented with an original or certified copy of the death certificate or an accurate and complete photocopy of an original or certified copy of the death certificate, to support the discharge of a Title IV loan due to death.</p>
<p>NOTE: Periodically, ED may validate records against the Social Security Death Index. Accounts on ED's database that match the Social Security Death Index on name and Social Security number will automatically be written off. If an exact match does not occur, an exception report will be generated. These excepted accounts may be transferred to the Contractor. Verification of death on these accounts must be documented as stated above. <br /><br />B. DISABILITY<br />If a borrower claims to be disabled, the Contractor shall advise the borrower that a "Request for Cancellation of Loans on Grounds of Permanent and Total Disability" (Refer to Standard Letters and Forms, OMB Form1845-0065, which ED will provide after Task Order award) must be completed by a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy legally licensed to practice medicine in the 50 U.S. states and/or U.S. Territories/Commonwealths as listed on Form 1845 and in regulations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall within three (3) calendar days of the borrower's request for disability status, forward the OMB Form 1845-0065 to the borrower. The Contractor shall update the account collector notepad upon completion of this action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review the borrower's request for disability and determine the borrower's eligibility for discharge. The Contractor shall verify that all certificates are thoroughly completed and the doctor's diagnosis is for a totally and permanently disabling condition. The Contractor shall secure a credit bureau report for debtor employment information and contact any listed employer for verification. The Contractor shall contact the American Medical Association or other State Licensing Agencies to verify that the doctor who signs the certificate is licensed to practice medicine in that state. The Contractor shall send a list of accounts recommended as dischargeable along with all disability documentation to ED for review and approval.</p>
<p>C. PROGRAMMATIC CANCELLATIONS<br />Special cancellation conditions are applicable to certain Perkins notes in cases where the borrower meets specified teaching, Peace Corp, Vista law enforcement and military requirements.</p>
<p>If the borrower claims entitlement to cancellation, the Contractor shall determine the borrower's entitlement to such cancellation within three (3) calendar days from the date of receipt of cancellation documents from the borrower. In the case of only partial cancellation, the Contractor shall submit to ED the necessary documentation for reduction of the borrower's account balance.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for negotiating the repayment of all remaining outstanding balances for accounts that are eligible for only partial cancellation. The Contractor will not receive payment for partial cancellation.</p>
<p>D. INCARCERATIONS<br />In situations where the borrower is determined to be incarcerated, the Contractor shall obtain verification from a prison official of the borrower's earliest release date. The Contractor shall document ED's system with the prison official's name, title (or official website), prison, prison telephone number and earliest release date.</p>
<p>If the borrower is to be incarcerated for a period exceeding nine (9) months, the Contractor shall recommend the account be recalled. If the borrower is scheduled to be incarcerated for a period of less than nine (9) months, the Contractor shall suspend collection activity on the account and follow up after the borrower's anticipated parole date. The Contractor shall also document the account notepad with this information.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the Department, Incarceration processing may be suspended. If suspended, the contractor will have the ability to recommend any borrower account be removed from its inventory for reason of Incarceration. Detailed processing flows and procedures will be distributed as part of the suspension process.</p>
<p>E. LITIGATIONS <br />If the Contractor determines through the course of collections, that the borrower has no intention of repaying their debt(s), the borrower is a potential candidate for litigation. For litigation purposes, the borrower account must meet certain criteria and the Contractor must prepare litigation packages within prescribed guidelines.<br />The Contractor shall conduct research to determine the borrower's ability to repay to include obtaining evidence that assets are in the borrower's name and that these assets can be seized or attached by lien. <br />Upon preparation of the account for litigation, the Contractor shall immediately submit the case file to ED for approval. ED will review each case for accuracy and compliance within thirty (30) days of receipt. If the Contractor fails to meet any litigation preparation requirements, the case will be returned to the Contractor for correction or completion of the requirements. The Contractor shall update any information contained in the package that becomes outdated due to non-compliance by the Contractor. The Contractor will receive the appropriate fixed fee for each case reviewed, and accepted by ED for referral to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The Government may designate, in writing, certain types of litigation accounts as "Special Litigation." Generally, "Special Litigation" accounts are those in categories for which the FSA believes the Government will be most effective in obtaining payment via the litigation process (e.g. borrower accounts within specific zip codes, etc.). A "Standard Litigation" account is any litigation preparation case that is not in a "Special Litigation" category designated by the Government.</p>
<p>F. INCOME CONTINGENT REPAYMENT PLAN (ICRP) ACCOUNTS<br />Income Continent Repayment consolidations are accounts, which are consolidated without the borrowers making the required payments under the regular consolidation program. The contractor shall document the account notepad with information regarding the borrower's financial condition.</p>
<p>G. ADMINISTRATIVE REHABILITATIONS<br />If a borrower's account is rehabilitated and the 9 timely payments are less than the minimum payment amount required, the Contractor will receive an administrative fee in lieu of a commission payment.</p>
<p>3.5 SUSPENSION OF COLLECTION ACTIVITY<br />The Contractor shall immediately suspend collection activity on an account and, if necessary (or requested by ED), refer the issue, (NOT RETURN THE ACCOUNT) to ED or ED's representative for resolution within five (5) calendar days after any of the following occur:<br /><br />a) The borrower disputes the amount owed citing, for example, that the debt was never incurred, was paid off, or should have been canceled.<br /><br />b) The borrower raises a legal defense against repayment (for example: closed school, ability to benefit, fraud, forgery, or circumstances under which ED may be prohibited from pursuing collection).<br /><br />c) The borrower requests a written review or hearing in response to the 65-Day Notice of Federal Offset or 30 days Administrative Wage Garnishment Notice. The Contractor shall process all such correspondence in accordance with ED requirements and guidelines.<br />Once ED has made a decision, the Contractor will be notified to resume collection activity or close and return the account. Failure by the Contractor to cease collection activity as required will result in recall of the account by ED.<br /><br />3.6 CO-MAKERS<br />Prior to the first transfer of accounts, ED will have initiated collection efforts in pursuit of both the borrower and co-maker prior to transfer of accounts to the Contractor. Once the Contractor determines that the borrower is unlocatable, unable to repay the loan(s) or is delinquent, the Contractor shall pursue collection from the co-maker to the extent permitted by law, or as instructed by ED.<br /><br />4.1 RECALL OF ACCOUNTS<br />A. The Contractor has twelve (12) months, beginning with the date of each transfer, to convert defaulted accounts to payment-in-full, satisfied in full, satisfactory repayment schedules, administrative resolution, or to prepare the account for AWG or litigation.<br />ED shall recall accounts not converted to one of these six categories within the twelve (12) month period.<br /><br />B. Periodically, ED performs matches with Federal employee databases and if the account is not in current repayment, will recall the account from the Contractor.<br /><br />C. In cases where an ED employee or ED representative has documented the account collector notepad with a repayment agreement, has placed the account on billing, and the first payment has posted within fifteen (15) days of the due date, the account may be immediately recalled by ED and no commission for any payment received will be granted to the Contractor.<br /><br />4.2 RETURN OF ACCOUNTS<br />The Contractor shall work an account to the level of effort as specified in the Task Order before the Contractor returns the account to ED. However, the Contractor may not return an account prior to six months from the date of transfer, unless the account balance is resolved. ED reserves the right to recall or require the return of any account or accounts at any time. During the first CPCS period, ED intends to recall accounts as frequently as 4 months after transfer. ED reserves the right to require Contractors to hold accounts for longer than 6 months.<br /><br />A. The Contractor shall follow procedures relating to the return of accounts as outlined below:<br />1. Any account that has been settled-in-full, or worked to the level of effort set forth in the Task Order must be returned by the Contractor within thirty calendar days after it reaches the applicable status.<br /><br />2. Changes in these time frames shall be made only with the approval of ED.<br />B. Accounts returned for Administrative Resolution must be returned via secure electronic file transfer (EFT) by the Contractor. The Contractor shall complete all paperwork for administrative resolutions. Those accounts identified as meeting ED requirements for write-off must be returned by type, as specified by ED, during regular Contractor electronic file returns. (All deaths would be grouped together, all Chapter 7 dischargeable Bankruptcies would be grouped together and all Chapter 13 Bankruptcies would be grouped together on that one file.) The Contractor shall submit to ED an electronic file by type, SSN and name for each account. The Contractor shall ensure ED's access to documentation (imaged or hardcopy) to support their request.<br />If ED determines that the Contractor has met Task Order requirements, the Monitor will approve the transmittal and return to the Contractor. The Contractor will then fax the transmittal and forward the EFT records to ED's computer contractor within two days. If the Monitor disapproves the transmittal, the Contractor will be informed of its deficiencies. The Contractor shall resolve these deficiencies before resubmitting the data to ED. The Contractor will prepare and forward administrative resolution documentation in the format requested by ED (hardcopy or imaged) to the appropriate government office or contractor designated by ED. Please see the PCA Procedures Manual for more information. <br /><br />4.3 RETENTION OF IN-REPAYMENT ACCOUNTS<br />The Contractor shall retain in-repayment accounts during the full period of performance (including any options, if exercised) of its Task Order with ED.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential Research and Development requirement. Note: A Small Business Sources Sought Notice number: HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-242 was previously issued on November 10, 2011. Small businesses may respond to either notice, but do not need to respond to both.</p>
<p>Interested businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to perform the project requirements stated below.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the government plan their acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research. The Government will not entertain questions regarding this market research.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of three Research and Development Sources Sought (RDSS) notices that were published for small clinical trials to test feasibility and specific target engagement of novel pharmacological treatments. Each RDSS notice is for treatments of a different group of disorders. If the interested business has capability with more than one group of disorders, it is not necessary to provide more than one capability statement/response. It is recommended however, that the capabilities with the other group(s) of disorders be referenced within the capability statement submitted.</p>
<p>Background.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling mental disorder characterized by deficits in thought processes, perceptions, and emotional responsiveness. According to the 2005 National Comorbidity Survey-Replication study [Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Walters EE. Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Archives of General Psychiatry, 2005 Jun;62(6):617-27.], the prevalence estimate is that about 26% of the U.S. adult population is affected by mental disorders. About 1.1% of the populations ages 18 and older suffer from schizophrenia. These include schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. While there are many pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and combination treatment options available to clinicians, many patients with psychotic spectrum disorders respond poorly to the currently available therapies.</p>
<p>Because of the substantial mortality and morbidity associated with inadequate treatment, serious mental illness is a major public health problem. The scope of this problem is vast both in terms of the numbers of affected individuals and the resultant societal and economic burden.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in basic science and in the understanding of complex illnesses offer promising new opportunities for researchers to pursue and offer new hope for those living with mental illnesses. Now is a critical time to take advantage of new breakthroughs and tools. But the paths for treatment discoveries are not clearly marked. Despite the tremendous advances in basic neuroscience and behavioral science that drive our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders, there is a dearth of new therapeutics in the discovery pipeline. [See From Discovery to Cure: Accelerating the development of new and personalized interventions for mental illnesses. Report of the National Advisory Mental Health Council's Workgroup (2010). http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/fromdiscoverytocure.PSf]</p>
<p>The high cost of developing novel drugs, the high attrition rate of candidate therapeutics during development and clinical testing, and adverse effects contribute to the high rate of failure of new compounds in clinical trials. [Munos B. 2009. Lessons from 60 years of pharmaceutical innovation. Nature Reviews 8:959-968.] In 2009, the number of novel drugs approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all disease areas continued to remain low, with only 19 new molecular entities approved. [Hughes B. 2010. 2009 FDA drug approvals. Nature Reviews 9:89-92]</p>
<p>At this point, the success rates for Phase II projects are the lowest for any phase in the discovery pipeline. The success rates for Phase II projects have fallen from 28% (2006-2007) to 18% (2008-2009) [Arrrowsmith J. Phase II failures: 2008-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 1 (2011)]. In contrast, the success rate for Phase III trials is much higher, around 50% [Arrrowsmith J. Phase III and submission failures: 2007-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 87 (2011)]</p>
<p>Phase II clinical trials that are well designed and well conducted can provide the data required to determine whether to proceed with a drug candidate into Phase III trials. Paul et al have described the need for a new paradigm for drug development based on "fast fail", i.e., focusing on proof of concept prior to proceeding to expensive Phase 3 trials. [Paul, SM, Mytelka, DS, Dunwiddie, CT, et al, How to improve R&amp;D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9, 203-214 (2010)]. This paradigm calls for small, deep trials, focused on proof of concept "experimental medicine" trials, to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy. Experimental medicine moves into human studies quickly with biomarkers, including imaging, to demonstrate biological effects. These types of small proof of concept trials could help de-risking a new compound or demonstrating a "fast fail" for a new target.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.</p>
<p>This initiative seeks to expeditiously test new compounds for psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The outcome of this initiative is also expected to lead to enhanced understanding of specific target engagement by such compounds and development of innovative treatment approaches for psychotic spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>The specific aims of this initiative are:</p>
<p>&bull; To expeditiously perform randomized clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy of such promising interventions in a well-characterized cohort of patients diagnosed with psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; At a minimum, each clinical trial shall be an adequately controlled study in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; Depending on pilot data available for interventions selected for testing, each trial may be a single-site or multisite study with a number of subjects adequate to address the primary hypotheses with a minimum power of 0.80. Sufficient patients should be enrolled in each study to establish proof of concept and/or inform a judgment whether the particular intervention warrants more extensive evaluation in larger clinical trials.<br />&bull; To establish a small group of clinical trials sites that will focus on identifying and testing promising pharmacological interventions for the treatment of psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a previous proof of concept (POC) clinical trial under the FAST-PS in larger clinical trials.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple scientific investigators and organizations will be required. The specific experience, ability, and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to) the five (5) items below:</p>
<p>1) Experience in performing clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in psychotic spectrum disorders specifically, including appropriate control groups;</p>
<p>2) Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects with psychotic spectrum disorders from multiple representative sites, and the ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial;</p>
<p>3) The capability to include appropriate measures to gauge target engagement and serve as biomarkers (e.g., imaging, EEG, ERP, pre-pulse inhibition, PET, clinical);</p>
<p>4) The capability to provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with psychotic spectrum disorders;</p>
<p>5) Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in psychotic spectrum disorders research.</p>

<p>Background.</p>
<p>Mood and Anxiety disorders are among the most common and serious disorders treated by mental health practitioners. According to the 2005 National Comorbidity Survey-Replication study [Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Walters EE. Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Archives of General Psychiatry, 2005 Jun;62(6):617-27.], the prevalence estimate is that about 26% of the U.S. adult population is affected by mental disorders. About 9.5% of the populations ages 18 and older suffer from mood disorders. These include major depressive disorder; dysthymic disorder (a chronic, mild depression); and bipolar disorder (also called manic depression). Major depressive disorder is, by itself, the leading cause of disability among Americans age 15 - 44, according to the World Health Organization. For Anxiety Disorders, the prevalence was about 18% of U.S. adult population. There are a wide variety of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and special phobias. While there are many pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and combination treatment options available to clinicians, many patients with mood and anxiety disorders respond poorly to the currently available therapies.</p>
<p>Because of the substantial mortality and morbidity associated with inadequate treatment, serious mental illness is a major public health problem. The scope of this problem is vast both in terms of the numbers of affected individuals and the resultant societal and economic burden.</p>

<p>Background.</p>
<p>The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are more common in the pediatric population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal bifida, or Down syndrome [Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT, Cook Jr. EH, Dawson G, Gordon B, Gravel JS, Johnson CP, Kellen RJ, Levy SE, Minshew NJ, Prizant BM, Rapin I, Rogers SJ, Stone WL, Teplin S, Tuchman RF, Volkmar FR. The screening and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 1999; 29(2): 439-484.] A study of a U.S. metropolitan area estimated that 3.4 of every 1,000 children 3-10 years old had autism [Yeargin-Allsopp M, Rice C, Karapurkar T, Doernberg N, Boyle C, Murphy C. Prevalence of Autism in a US Metropolitan Area. The Journal of the American Medical Association. 2003 Jan 1;289(1):49-55]. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm.html) found that 1 in every 110 eight-year old children were diagnosable for an ASD. ASD range in severity, with autism being the most debilitating form while other disorders, such as Asperger syndrome, produce milder symptoms. There is currently no a pharmacological cure for ASDs, although many of the dysfunctional, coinciding behaviors may be treated pharmacologically, although there is no single best treatment package for all children with ASD.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in basic science and in the understanding of complex illnesses offer promising new opportunities for researchers to pursue and offer new hope for those living with mental illnesses. Now is a critical time to take advantage of new breakthroughs and tools. But the paths for treatment discoveries are not clearly marked.

<p>&bull; To expeditiously perform randomized clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy of such promising interventions in a well-characterized cohort of patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; At a minimum, each clinical trial shall be an adequately controlled study in patients with autism spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; Depending on pilot data available for interventions selected for testing, each trial may be a single-site or multisite study with a number of subjects adequate to address the primary hypotheses with a minimum power of 0.80. Sufficient patients should be enrolled in each study to establish proof of concept and/or inform a judgment whether the particular intervention warrants more extensive evaluation in larger clinical trials.<br />&bull; To establish a small group of clinical trials sites that will focus on identifying and testing promising pharmacological interventions for the treatment of autism spectrum Disorders.<br />&bull; To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a previous proof of concept (POC) clinical trial under the FAST-AS in larger clinical trials.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple scientific investigators and organizations will be required. The specific experience, ability, and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to) the five (5) items below:</p>
<p>1) Experience in performing clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in autism spectrum disorders specifically, including appropriate control groups;</p>
<p>2) Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects with autism spectrum disorders from multiple representative sites, and the ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial;</p>
<p>3) The capability to include appropriate measures to gauge target engagement and serve as biomarkers (e.g., imaging, EEG, ERP, pre-pulse inhibition, PET, clinical);</p>
<p>4) The capability to provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with autism spectrum disorders;</p>
<p>5) Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in autism spectrum disorders research.</p>

Detection should include, but not be limited to, commercial and military explosives, Home Made Explosives (HME), improvised explosive devices (IEDs), IED components, as well as non-explosive threats (guns and knives). NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select personnel screening equipment for comparative testing and evaluation. A report will be written and available for use by Government agencies and military services. Technologies employed for detection should utilize ionizing energy. This sources sought notice solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, performance, and radiation specifications 
This announcement serves to survey product availability, and is NOT a formal solicitation and is NOT an RFP.
 This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Our intent is to test technologically mature and market ready equipment. 

A. Technical Summary Guidance: 

Vendors should provide the following information (1-5):
1. Company Name
2. Points of Contact
3. Technical Description (5 pages or less)
4. Radiation Form Information (as outlined in supporting documentation)
5. Quad chart for each model (one version/model)

6. Sample Description of Performance Parameters for Personnel Screening Equipment 

The following parameters measure personnel screening equipment performance in inspecting representative threats at the point of entry: 

6.1 Detection Effectiveness, measured as a percentage, consists of the number of successful threat detections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected.

6.1.1 Successful Detections include: a) True Positives - personnel screening equipment determines the presence of a threat when present, and b) True Negatives - personnel screening equipment determines that threats are not present when applicable. 

6.1.2 Unsuccessful detections include: a) False Positives - personnel screening equipment determines that there are threats present when they are NOT, and b) False Negatives - personnel screening equipment determines that there are no threats present when they ARE present.
 

6.1.3 IED threat may include the following explosives: RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, Semtex, and Water Gels. 

6.2 Throughput is the number of objects of interest that can be fully inspected per hour, once the personnel screening equipment is operational.

6.3 Ease of Use is a subjective evaluation based on the responses of an operator survey, which assess the level of difficulty of operation. 

6.4 Transportability/Portability consists of transport of the main component of the personnel screening equipment to the administrative facility. This requirement will be assessed in terms of the time, manpower and situational needs of operators manning the point of entry. 

6.5 Reliability is measured by the degree that the personnel screening equipment complete the mission without an operational failure.
 Inability of personnel screening equipment to initiate analysis when required constitutes an operational mission failure. 

6.6 Maintainability, measured in hours, is the duration of time that, on average, the personnel screening equipment will function as designed without maintenance beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies. 

7. Test Conditions: 

7.1 Standard Conditions and Threats

These standard conditions and representative threats are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each personnel screening equipments features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 

7.1.1 Representative threats or stimulants shall be used as objects of interest that might be conveyed through a point of entry.
 

7.2 Typical Operational Scenario: Personnel screening equipment will be used to non-intrusively inspect personal articles and personnel themselves at a point of entry. 

DEFINITIONS 

Explosive Detection Equipment - devices that determine the presence of characteristics of energetic/explosive materials

False Alarm Rate - the probability that a personnel screening device classifies the object of interest as a threat when no threats are present

Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) - an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuze and firing circuit 

Objects of Interest - the subject matter of attention, for example mail, small parcels, personal articles, and personnel themselves

Performance Parameter - capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment

Point of entry - the passageway through a protected perimeter through which all personnel pass

Contracts may be issued up to three years after selection approval. Typically, the contracts will consist of three ordering schedules, each schedule not to exceed one year, for a total of up to three years maximum. The total amount of each contract over the three year ordering period may not exceed $4,500,000. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. Task Orders will be primarily for large projects with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541310; size standard $4.5 million. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services that may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, shop drawing review, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. All design must comply with the Savannah District Design Manual. All drawing files must be delivered in the (*.dgn) format. All drawing files will be developed using the Tri Service AEC Standard, as supplemented by the Savannah District instructions. The standards include naming convention, file and directory structure, line weights, levels, and color. Specifications will be produced in SpecsIntact using the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). Responses to Government review comments will be provided on the Corps of Engineers Design Review and Checking System (DrChecks).</span></p>

<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory, based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Award will be made to the firm determined to be most highly qualified. Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. For this solicitation, Factor 1 (Specialized Experience and Technical Competence) and Factor 2 (Key Personnel) are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Factor 3 (Past Performance), Factor 4 (Work Management) and Factor 5 Knowledge of Locality and significantly more important than Factor 6 (Volume of DoD Contract Awards). Past Performance, Work Management and Knowledge of Locality are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Volume of DoD Contract Awards will only be used as a *tie-breaker* among firms that are essentially technically equal. Information on each factor should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. It is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. If more than one office is represented, this must be stated clearly in the work management plan and the Selection Board will consider the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects.</p>

<p>Specifications are as follows:</p>
<p>MULTIMODE8 UPGRADE<br />Configured as follows:<br />CONFIGURED SYSTEM:<br />MULTIMODE8-U-NSV - MULTIMODE8-U UPG PKG INCL NSV<br />V8-compatible Upgrade to an Existing MultiMode SPM without an<br />Existing NanoScope V Control Station<br />-- For a MultiMode SPM without an existing NanoScope V Control<br />Station, this upgrade provides a new V8-compatible NanoScope V<br />Control Station, MultiMode base electronics upgrade, 37 pin adapter<br />(Model 37PA) and a 30-inch LCD monitor.<br />-- Recommended MultiMode upgrades include Model MMLNQU for<br />Q-control capability or a new head, Model TVOH-MULTIMODE, for both<br />Q control and application module capability<br />-- Enables operation of our exclusive ScanAsyst Mode using exclusive<br />Peak Force Tapping technology, including automatic image optimization<br />technology<br />-- REQUIRES return of certain existing AFM hardware following<br />NanoScope V installation. Items to be returned include the NanoScope<br />controller and Digital Signal Processor (DSP or DSI) board from the<br />existing Control Station controller (Models E, II, III, IIIa, IV or IVa) plus<br />the Extender Electronics Module (Models PHASE-01, PHASE-R,<br />QUADREX) if AFM system is equipped with PHASE. Contact Customer<br />Service for RMA number for return paperwork. If controller is not<br />returned within 30 days following upgrade installation, the customer will<br />be invoiced the full price of the NanoScope V Control Station.<br />-- REQUIRES Model UNIVECPOT for Electrochemistry (NOT compatible<br />with the older Electrochemistry AFM/STM Converter Base for the<br />MultiMode SPM, Model MMECAFM)<br />-- REQUIRES cable clamp Model VT-103-CC-UNIV if upgrading the<br />NanoScope Control Station for a MultiMode SPM currently housed in an<br />older VT-103-MM-X Integrated Acoustic/Vibration Isolation hood<br />-- REQUIRES a minimum of one-day installation/training (Model<br />ITCS1-SRV) that must be purchased separately<br />-- NOTE: 1) NOT compatible with obsolete MultiMode predecessor<br />AFM/LFM models<br />MONITORS:<br />MONITOR - FACTORY SUPPLIED MONITOR</p>
<p>MM8-PFTUNA <br />PeakForce TUNA Application Module for MultiMode8<br />-- High bandwidth, high gain, low noise module with user selectable gain<br />settings that enables exclusive PeakForce TUNA mode<br />-- Also enables TUNA, TR-TUNA, and CAFM<br />PeakForce TUNA Mode<br />-- Measures ultra-low currents between probe tip and sample as probe is<br />scanned over the sample.<br />-- Operates in PeakForce Tapping mode with direct force control and minimal<br />lateral forces. Thus avoids the artifacts stemming from probe and sample<br />damage and retains highest spatial resolution. This enables use on soft, fragile,<br />or loosely bound samples that are likely to be damaged by contact mode.<br />Measures both, peak current and cycle averaged current.<br />-- Includes Bruker's proprietary ScanAsyst automated scan optimization.<br />-- Includes Bruker's proprietary PeakForce QNM for directly correlated<br />nanomechanical information. PeakForce QNM allows quantitative mapping of<br />nano-mechanical properties including elastic modulus, adhesion, deformation,<br />and dissipation, while simultaneously imaging sample topography at high<br />resolution.<br />Includes 6 gain settings ranging from 100nA/V to 20pA/V. Achieves &gt;10kHz<br />bandwidth for peak current detection at highest amplifier gain setting, which at<br />the same time provides sub-100fA noise level in the cycle averaged current<br />under imaging conditions.<br />-- A bias of mV to 10V can be applied.<br />TUNA Mode<br />-- Measures ultra-low currents between the probe tip and a sample (typically<br />covered with a thin dielectric film) as the probe is scanned over the sample<br />-- Images variations in quality/integrity of thin dielectric films by measuring the<br />tunneling current, including variations in film thickness, location of electrical<br />defects, and other characteristics<br />-- Current is measured using an ultra-low current amplifier with 3 gain settings<br />ranging from 1nA/V to 20pA/V. Provides typical noise level below 100fA at<br />highest gain under imaging bandwidth.<br />-- A bias of mV to 10V can be applied<br />TR TUNA Mode<br />-- TR TUNA uses torsional resonance feedback. This reduces both vertical and<br />lateral forces on samples, which enables TR TUNA to be used on soft samples<br />otherwise likely to be damaged by contact mode (e.g. polymers) or on loosely<br />bound samples likely to be disrupted by contact mode (e.g. nanowires).<br />-- Current is measured using an ultra-low current amplifier 3 gain settings<br />ranging from 1nA/V to 20pA/V. Provides typical noise level below 100fA at<br />highest gain under imaging bandwidth.<br />CAFM Mode<br />-- Measures low-level currents between the probe tip and a sample as the<br />probe is scanned over the sample<br />-- Images variations in conductivity and quality/integrity of conductive samples<br />by measuring the current. CAFM is used for measuring variations in film<br />thickness, location of electrical defects, and other characteristics.<br />-- Current is measured using a low current amplifier with 3 gain settings<br />ranging from 100nA/V to 2nA/V.<br />-- A bias of mV to 10V can be applied<br />Additional Information<br />-- Package includes Application Module, software and cantilever holder and one<br />10-pack of PFTUNA probes<br />-- Includes one additional day on-site installation/training when purchased with<br />any other on-site installation/training package (Models ITCS, ITCS1-SRV or<br />ITCS3)<br />-- If purchased separately, customer must also purchase one day of<br />installation/application training (Model ITCS1-SRV)<br />-- CE compliant<br />-- REQUIRES a MultiMode8 SPM with application module ready optical head.<br />-- NOTE: An acoustic/vibration isolation system is strongly recommended<br />Top-view Optical Head for Existing MultiMode SPMs<br />-- Standard or Application Module Top-view Optical Head for on-axis viewing<br />of probe and sample (select type when ordering)<br />-- Included with the MultiMode SPMs but available as a replacement part<br />-- Provides upgraded head electronics for lowest possible noise and cleanest<br />possible images when imaging in Q control with a Quadrex-enhanced<br />NanoScope Control Station<br />-- Includes one Electric Field Cantilever Holder (Model MMEFCH) with<br />Application Module Optical Head<br />-- REQUIRES Application Module-ready electronics and PHASE or<br />QUADREX-enhanced Control Station for Application Module Optical Head<br />-- REQUIRES serial number of existing MultiMode SPM on Bruker price<br />quotation and on customer PO<br />-- NOTE: Application Module Optical Head is NOT compatible with obsolete<br />MMAH Series Atmospheric Hoods for the MultiMode, but is compatible with<br />new MMAH2 Series<br />Configured as follows:<br />HEAD:<br />MM-AM - MULTIMODE SPM AM HEAD<br />125 x 125-micron Vertical Engage Leak Resistant AFM Scanner<br />-- 125-micron x 125-micron scan size; 5.0-micron vertical range<br />-- Includes single-tube piezoelectric tube scanner with three-point support for<br />microscope head<br />-- Includes calibration rulings<br />-- Scan sizes listed are nominal maxima for piezo drives of &plusmn;220V (standard<br />on all NanoScope models)<br />-- Designed for vertical motion, eliminating tilt and lateral movement of the<br />cantilever during engage.

<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to increase small business size standards for 20 industries and one sub-industry in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 53, Real Estate and Rental and Leasing.  As part of its ongoing comprehensive review of all size standards, SBA evaluated all size standards in NAICS Sector 53 to determine whether the existing size standards should be retained or revised.  This proposed rule is one of a series of proposals that will examine size standards of industries grouped by NAICS Sector.  SBA issued a White Paper entitled "Size Standards Methodology" and published in the October 21, 2009 issue of the Federal Register.  That "Size Standards Methodology" is available on its website at www.sba.gov/size for public review and comments.  The "Size Standards Methodology" White Paper explains how SBA establishes, reviews and modifies its receipts based and employee based small business size standards.  In this proposed rule, SBA has applied its methodology that pertains to establishing, reviewing, and modifying a receipts based size standard.
<p>We invite you to review the proposed rule and submit your comments.  The proposed rule explains how to submit your comments to SBA.  We recommend that you comment through the Federal eRulemaking Portal: www.regulations.gov.  Follow the instructions there for submitting your comments.  SBA will not accept comments submitted by email.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission of comments is January 17, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES) and/or the Remedial Action Cost Engineering Requirements (RACER) software programs to AECOM Technical Services with use of Labor Hour Task Orders as needed.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304  (1) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii) which states that only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.  This action is to support the continuation of current efforts of a sole source firm with the capability of developing parametric models for cost estimating applications and providing associated training/support.  The proposed acquisition is to develop cost engineering estimating models for building construction, environmental remedial action cleanup, and civil works construction.  The models must be in the correct format required and consistent in structure with the other models developed to be used with/by the current PACES and or the RACER software programs.  The PACES and RACER applications are the Tri-Service (Army, Navy, and Air Force) approved systems for parametric building and environmental remediation cost estimating.  <br>It is considered that award to a new contractor would result in a significant duplication of cost well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays.  All responses should be directed to Nancy A. Wilhite at nancy.a.wilhite@usace.army.mil and Gregory Hodgson at Gregory.Hodgson@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone or facsimile inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  However, any other responsible firms that may be interested in this synopsis may submit a brief statement of their interest and qualifications in response to this synopsis.  This statement should be no more than five pages in length.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Interested firms must provide statements submitted via e-mail no later than 5:00 p.m. CST on 30 November 2011.  The Government will evaluate the statements and may issue a request for quotation to potentially qualified firms if a basis exists for a competitive environment.  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), is soliciting comments and questions for the DRAFT PWS (attached) for a Microsoft Enterprise Licensing Agreement to gather comments and questions from Industry, specifically Microsoft Certified Large Account Resellers (LARS) authorized to resell to the Federal Government, regarding the feasibility and completeness of the proposed approach to meet the requirements under this procurement. In addition, the Government is requesting a brief capabilities statement to identify any additional firms who possess both the capability and experience to provide Microsoft licenses, assurance and core support services via Microsoft Premier Services on an enterprise level.  During the draft PWS comment period, the Government requests comments and/or questions that will enable a better understanding of the scope of this procurement. Please pay special attention to any information that might be missing and needed for submitting a complete quote. This action is to encourage and promote early exchanges of information for this requirement. 

The Government is seeking comments by interested companies relating to the draft PWS as well as a demonstration of capabilities to successfully perform an effort of this magnitude. Companies are requested to provide questions or concerns they may have with the overall procurement. The requested comments and capabilities statements are for informational purposes only.

All information contained in the draft PWS is preliminary and is subject to change in subsequent releases of the PWS. 

Prospective offerors are encouraged to review the draft PWS and offer written comments, questions and/or a capabilities statement via e-mail to matthew.ginty@va.gov no later than close of business December 2, 2011. Comments and questions should reference the applicable PWS paragraph number and be referenced in the body of the email or as an attachment to the email in Microsoft Office format.  Comments that relate to recommended language changes must provide a rational for the recommended change.  Interested parties submitting a Capabilities Statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate ability to meet the stated requirements for an enterprise wide procurement of this magnitude. The Capabilities Statement should clearly present evidence that the interested party is fully capable of providing the required Microsoft licenses and Microsoft certified core support services and as such may include any information that the interested party feels is relevant.  Prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to submit questions and comments as soon as they are identified. Telephone questions will not be accepted. 

It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet for the release of the draft solicitation, solicitation (if any) and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the draft solicitation, solicitation (if any) and amendments (if any).No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, the solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on the Internet. This Request for Information (RFI) is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Requirements are subject to change based on feedback and/or other government initiatives.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(2) Offers/Quotes must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items) (NOV 2011) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.</p>
<p>(3) FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items) (JUN 2010)</p>
<p>(4) Other Clauses, Terms &amp; Conditions:<br />52.212-5: Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items (AUG 2011) (Deviation)<br />52.252-2: Clauses Incorporated by Reference (February 1998) <br />52.252-6: Authorized Deviations in Clauses (April 1984)<br />252.212-7001: Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (DEC 2010) (Deviation)<br />252.227-7021: Rights in Data - Existing Works (March 1979)</p>
<p><br />UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW - READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>(e) Questions concerning payments:</p>
<p>(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.</p>
<p>(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.</p>

Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is AG-02RC-S-12-0010 and is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

<p>DESCRIPTION: The Idaho Panhandle National Forest, Coeur d'Alene Nursery, is soliciting for 2992 expandable polystyrene (EPS) styrofoam block seedling growing containers. The containers must be made of Styrofoam to insulate the root plug from extreme cold and warm temperature fluctuations.

They must provide 160 cavities per block. Each cavity must have a volume of 5.5 cu. in (90 ml), be 6" (15.2 cm) in depth, and have a top diameter of 1.2" (3.0 cm). Each of the160 plug holes must have ridges to prevent root spiral. The block must have root egress holes that are large enough to allow moisture and root egress but not too large that growing media will fall out while filling. The top and bottom surface of the blocks must be flat without legs or protrusions that would prevent the containers from traveling under the sowing and extracting equipment at the Nursery. The containers must be white to reflect shortwave radiation and emit less long wave (heat) radiation to prevent stressing seedling foliage. The EPS will have added ultraviolet light blockers to allow the containers to be used for at least 3 crops.<br />Inspection will be made at the delivery point and will consist of random sampling of the product for conformance with specifications and quantity count. Products delivered under any resulting contract must conform to the specifications for all characteristics.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br /><br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br /><br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

 The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.
 The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<p>The solicitation for this Feasibility Study was originally posted on August 8, 2011, and was suspended on September 28, 2011. Please note that several modifications have been made to the original solicitation.</p>
<p>The objective of the Zacatecas Landfill Gas Pilot Project Feasibility Study is to enable the development of a 3 MW landfill gas collection and power generation pilot project in the Municipality of Zacatecas.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in Contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />All referenced Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and provisions in this solicitation may be accessed via the internet at https://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br /><br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition.

<p>Q. Is there a page limit on the technical response?<br />A. There is no page limit on technical response.</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Advanced COMINT Collection Techniques &amp; Enablers<br /><br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 11-02-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the laboratory's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required to support advanced COMmunications INTelligence (COMINT) collection techniques and enablers. Solutions to engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. The overall technical objective of the BAA is to develop research into unique and innovative techniques and algorithms that support the identification, collection, processing, exploitation and/or manipulation of electronic communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. The Government is interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Developing techniques for the detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation of emerging communication signals of interest; (2) Advancing digital signal processing software methodologies in support of new and existing systems; and (3) Integration of these capabilities into information operations and collection systems. Detailed focus area and definition of problems follow here: (1) Detection and identification of target signals, dense signal environments, low power signals, low Signal to Interferer Noise Ratio (SINR), and power control. Due to the proliferation of wireless devices worldwide, there are significant numbers of signals of interest across the spectrum. The ability for identification and collection in dense signal environments, low power signals low SINR, and power control etc., is highly desired. (2) Any technologies that will enable SIGnals INTelligence (SIGINT) systems and/or platforms with an improved ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and more importantly geolocate signals of interest would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation: Technology that can further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is a critical focus area of research covered by this BAA. Particular attention will be paid to geolocation technologies. Technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters that are below the level of interference. (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD): Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired. We will continue to pursue these methods, but also encourage new and innovative techniques, including but not limited to spatial techniques, blind adaptive techniques and Kalman filtering. Research into specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms is also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamforming and digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antennas are a part of this announcement. This includes developing both temporal and spatial interference cancellation techniques. Also of interest are techniques that utilize the latest technology and emerging processor architectures as well as applying systems engineering approaches to platform integration, existing asset sharing, signal processing paths hardware constraints and reducing size, weight and power. (6) Techniques for improved geolocation including time difference of arrival (TDOA), frequency difference of arrival (FDOA), channel equalization, angle of arrival (AOA) and systems equalization techniques for signals in moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable are also desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: Critical to this BAA is developing signal reconstruction and signal identification (along with the technology thrusts mentioned above) for emerging military and commercial radio communications including third, fourth and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (8) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-type platforms. Attention to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest. (9) Information Operations (IO) consists of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations (EW Ops), network warfare operations (NW Ops) and influence operations (IFO). The innovative techniques and capabilities described in this BAA play a vital role in capturing key indicators of measure of performance (MOP) and measure of effectiveness (MOE) for information operations. The processed information furnished from these intelligence gathering technologies provides the continuous decision-quality information necessary to successfully employ air, space, and information operations. Integration of these techniques into information operations systems is also of high interest.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in decreasing order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates an understanding of the problem, the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, and integration approach; (2) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; (3) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; and (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.<br /><br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.<br />Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html..</p>

<RESPDATE>112211
<CONTACT>Thomas D. Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-2666, Fax (937) 656-7538, Email Thomas.Sharkey@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Request for Information and Sources Sought<br />Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System</strong> <br /><br />This is a request for information, issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capability to accomplish the effort described herein. The ASC/WNS (Simulators Division) will be competing the Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) with deliveries beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for industry comment in early calendar year (CY) 2012 and expect contract award in late 2012 or early 2013. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br />This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources for a system in support of the Combat Air Forces' (CAF), Special Operations Commands' (SOCOM), and Air Force Special Operations Commands' (AFSOC) Tactical Air Control Party and Combat Controllers in performance of Terminal Control, Terminal Guidance, Close Air Support and Joint Fires operations. The potential exists for the future contract to also provide systems to support the Marine Corp ANGLICO's, US Army Forward Observers / Joint Fires Observers and various units throughout SOCOM. This RFI is intended to help the government formulate the acquisition strategy and schedule. <br /><br />JTC TRS is an OSD derived program designed to fulfill an immediate need for realistic training and mission rehearsal for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), Joint Fires Support, and Air Traffic Control in a simulated and controlled environment. The anticipated system(s) will be used to train basic procedures in the schoolhouse environment as well as mission rehearsal in large scale exercises. Mission rehearsal capabilities to practice, validate, and verify Joint Doctrine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are essential. This training capability provides direct support to Overseas Contingency and Combat Operations. Both manual real time control and automated simulation of airborne assets is required. Multiple configurations of the basic training system are anticipated which include a fixed version and a portable version suitable for forward deployment and/or ship board operations. The fixed-platform version will be configurable to suit student groups in a school house environment, team training and individual mission rehearsal. Instructor Operator Station(s), robust simulated threat environment, simulated natural environment, and Brief/Debrief Systems are all required subsystems. The military services are investing heavily in high fidelity, globally networked, combat mission simulations to provide training in virtual environments that approach live operations. All services are stressing interoperability as a basic requirement. By the time JTC TRS is expected to be fielded, many air-to-ground platforms will have simulators that are fully network interoperable. <br /><br />This requirement drives visual simulation requirements, geographically accurate visual databases, high fidelity representations of weapons systems that interact with JTACs, and high fidelity simulation of weapons effects. Each JTAC site will connect into the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) as well as other service and joint networks. This will require the JTC TRS to comply with CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com/) and follow the guidelines of CJCSI 6212.01C. An associate contract agreement with the DMON network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of distributed mission integration.<br /><br />The JTC TRS acquisition strategy was planned to be "build-to-print" based on a Production Representative Article (PRA); however, the PRA does not meet all of the requirements of the Government Performance Specification (PSpec). The Government intends to set aside a period of the contract period of performance for the development and test of an engineering development model before a Milestone C production decision is made.<br /><br />Detailed performance requirements can be found in the attached notional PSpec. Please note that this attachment may be updated. The Government anticipates scheduling both industry days and&nbsp;PRA demonstration days prior to RFP release. The USAF has a requirement for at least 55 systems to be delivered beginning in FY13 through FY19. The Government anticipates a contractor logistics support concept for the CAF. All systems will be housed in Government facilities. Government-contracted instructor/operators will support assets acquired for SOCOM/AFSOC under a separate contract. <br /><br />In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br /><br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br /><br />2. A description of your company's experience in developing and deploying high fidelity training devices and simulations for combat training, including a description of your experience in networking simulators and working with interoperability mechanisms such as Distributed Interactive Simulation and High Level Architecture protocols<br /><br />3. A description of your capability to develop, produce, test, and support a training system that meets the basic requirements described in the attached draft Government PSpec. Include information about your software development, manufacturing and production capabilities (including any ISO, CMMI or other certifications that you have achieved), as well as any subcontractor/teaming relationships that might pertain to this effort.<br /><br />4. Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to either complete the PRA development or provide your own solution that would meet the requirements of the PSpec. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the limited development using the PRA versus proposing your own solution.<br /><br />5. A description of your company's capabilities and experiences in the worldwide deployment and support of complex training systems. Assuming a contract award in the 1st quarter of CY13, how soon could your company deliver an operational trainer to a CONUS/OCONUS location, and how many systems per year can your company deploy?<br /><br />6. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br /><br />7. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br /><br />8. Comments to the attached Government performance specification. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges each offeror sees in the draft performance description, as well as any areas where the PSpec does not provide sufficient detail for any requirement that would allow a JTAC to complete a training activity or mission rehearsal. Your inputs will be evaluated to determine if changes are required to the performance spec.<br /><br />9. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br /><br />10. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 333319, with a size standard of 500 employees. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS&nbsp;333319 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.).<br /><br />Technical questions may be directed to Kenneth Millard, Program Manager at 937-255-4786, email: kenneth.millard@wpafb.af.mil. Contractual questions may be directed to Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to: ASC/WNSK (Attn: Tom Sharkey) 2300 D Street, Bldg 32 Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7249 e-mail: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. FAX: (937) 656-7538.<br /><br />Responses are requested no later than close of business on 22 Nov 11. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding comments to the draft Government PSpec. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

Accordingly, the vision is to transform the Army's warfighting support elements into a more effective, results-oriented and efficient force to optimize the Army's capability to man, organize, train, equip, and maintain a strategic land combat force that is the ultimate instrument of national resolve and evolve to a future force that continues to provide that overwhelming and decisive military capability. <br><br>1.3 Objectives:  The requirements for this contract are to provide advisory and assistance services to the Deputy Undersecretary of the Army's office (DUSA) through application of proven business principals and workload performance systems for improved organizational alignment, performance management, cross-functional decision-making, and the knowledge/information to enhance or enable these processes and improvements.

Evidence of such agreement(s) must be made available to the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request.  The contractor shall restrict access to proprietary information to the minimum number of employees necessary for performance of this contract.  Further, the contractor agrees that it will not utilize proprietary data obtained from such other companies in preparing proposals (solicited or unsolicited) to perform additional services or studies for the United States Government.  The contractor agrees to execute agreements with companies furnishing proprietary data in connection with work performed under this contract, obligating the contractor to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure so long as such data remains proprietary, and to furnish copies of such agreement to the Contracting Officer.  Contractor further agrees that such proprietary data shall not be used in performing for the Department of Defense additional work in the same field as work performed under this contract if such additional work is procured competitively.  (FAR 9.505-4(b))<br><br>(2)	Preparation of Statements of Work or Specifications.  If the contractor under this contract assists substantially in the preparation of a statement of work or specifications, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort (solicited or unsolicited) which is based on such statement of work or specifications.

The provisions of this clause shall not apply to any system, subsystem, or major component for which the contractor is the sole source of supply or which it participated in designing or developing.   (FAR 9.505-4(b))<br><br>(f)	The policy of the Army Contracting Command (ACC) is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable organizational conflicts of interest.  An organizational conflict of interest means that because of existing or planned activities, an offeror or contractor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance to the agency, or has an unfair competitive advantage, or the offeror or contractor's objectivity is, or might be, impaired.<br><br>It is not the intention of the ACC to foreclose a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  ACC Contracting Officers are fully empowered to evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination of such action may be negotiated between the impaired vendor and the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer's business judgment and sound discretion in identifying, negotiating, and eliminating OCI scenarios should not adversely affect the ACC's policy for competition.  ACC is committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and perceived OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the mission of the ACC, the Army, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.<br><br>(g)	Mitigation plans.  The successful contractor will be required to permit a Government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for verification purposes.  The ACC reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in the best interests of the ACC or the Army.  Additionally, after award the ACC will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed, in the event of changes in the vendor community due to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest.<br><br>(h)	Potential Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The following provides potential vendors with examples of situations where mitigation plans may or may not be required by the ACC.  These examples are not intended to be inclusive.<br><br>(1)	Unequal access to information.  Access to "nonpublic information" as part of the performance of an Army contract could provide the contractor a competitive advantage in a later competition for any other Army contract.  Such an advantage could easily be perceived as unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the relevant information.  If the requirements of the Army procurement anticipate the successful vendor may have access to nonpublic information, the successful vendor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.  Alternatively, the "nonpublic information" may be provided to all vendors.<br><br>(2)	Biased ground rules.  A contractor in the course of performance of an Army contract, has in some fashion established important "ground rule" for another Army contract, where the same contractor may be a competitor.  For example, a contractor may have drafted the statement of work, specifications, or evaluation criteria of a future Army procurement.  The primary concern of the Army in this case is that a contractor so situated could slant key aspects of procurement in its own favor, to the unfair disadvantage of competing vendors.  If the requirements of the Army procurement anticipate the contractor may have been in a position to establish important ground rules, including but not limited to those described herein, the contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.<br><br>(3)	Impaired objectivity.  A contractor in the course of performance of an Army contract is placed in a situation of providing assessment and evaluation findings over itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship.  The concern in this case is that the contractor's ability to render impartial advice to the Army could appear to be undermined by the contractor's financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed or evaluated.  In these situations, a "walling off" of lines of communication may well be insufficient to remove the perception that the objectivity of the contractor has been tainted.  If the requirements of the Army procurement indicate that the successful vendor may be in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or corporate siblings, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship, the affected contractor should provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the vendor from the affected contract work.  Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party vendor.<br><br>(i)	Disclosure by offerors or contractors participating in an ACC acquisition.<br><br>(1)	Offerors or contractors should provide information which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest, (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether the offeror or contractor has a possible OCI.<br><br>(2)	If the offeror or contractor does not disclose any relevant facts concerning an OCI, the offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer or signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief no such facts exist relevant to possible OCI.<br><br>(j)	Remedies for nondisclosure.  The following are possible remedies should an offeror or contractor refuse to disclose, or misrepresent, any information regarding a potential OCI:<br><br>(1)	Refusal to provide adequate information may result in disqualification for award.<br><br>(2)	Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest may also result in the disqualification of the offeror for award.<br><br>(3)	Termination of the contract, if the nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award.<br><br>(4)	Disqualification from subsequent ACC contracts.<br><br>(5)	Other remedial action may be permitted or provided by law or in the resulting contract.<br><br>1.9.  Earned Value Tracking<br><br>1.9.1. The government requires time collection at the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) task level using Army Data Center Fairfield's (ADCF) Earned Value Tracking System using the Army Workload Processing System (AWPS). The automated system for entering appropriate data is simple to use. A data entry guide will be provided to the contractor.   Note, these reports are intended to identify "earned value" only in the sense that they will document hours expended, costs incurred and task/schedule completion in a manner that promotes trend analysis and integrated management assessment of performance.  The contractor is NOT required to establish/maintain its own Earned Value Management System (EVMS) or compute and report EVMS ratios. <br><br>1.9.2 Monthly invoices must be submitted including details such as hours worked by each individual and billing rate by skill categories.  Contractor invoices must also indicate current, task order to date, percentage expended, and remaining dollar amounts.  In addition, ODC purchases must be detailed.<br><br>1.9.3 Contractor will, in addition to invoices, submit monthly status reports including financial and operational data.        <br><br>	1.9.3.1 The financial reports shall include all labor, material, and travel costs incurred by the contractor.  The report shall be formatted to provide labor hours and related costs for the current period, the task order to date, the total amount negotiated for the task order, and the amount remaining on the task order.  The ODCs shall be reported similarly.  This format allows efficient, effective and accurate tracking to task order financials over the full course of the effort, and provides effective insight into declining funds availability so the government can budget in a timely manner.<br><br>   1.9.3.2	 Operational status shall include relevant quality control data drawn from the contractor's approved QCP (see section 1.6.1above) when appropriate.<br><br>1.9.4.  PHASE IN /PHASE OUT PERIOD (If applicable):  To minimize any decreases in productivity and to prevent possible negative impacts on additional services, the Contractor shall have personnel on board,  during the [Insert the time period, i.e., sixty (60) day, thirty (30) day, etc.] phase in/ phase out periods if part of a task order requirement.  During the phase in period, the Contractor shall become familiar with performance requirements in order to commence full performance of services on a task order start date.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>PART 2<br>DEFINITIONS & ACRONYMS<br><br><br>2.  DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS:<br><br>2.1 DEFINITIONS:<br><br>Best Effort:  That effort expended by the contractor to perform within the awarded ceiling price all work specified in this task order (TO) and all other obligations under this TO and the basic contract.  This effort includes providing required qualified personnel, properly supervised, and following industry accepted methodologies and other practices.  The effort is further characterized by operating at all times with the Government's best interest in mind, using efficient and effective methods, and demonstrating sound cost control.  The effort must be identical to the effort that would be expended if this were a firm-fixed price TO and the contractor's profits were dependent upon reducing costs while meeting the Government's requirements in terms of quality and schedule.  Failure to provide this required effort may result in the withholding of payment for hours expended that do not qualify as best effort or a reduction in the rate per hour to reflect decreased value of services received.<br><br>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

Submit your proposals only in person or by mail.<br> 	Questions and other communications - The Government will answer questions, if they are asked in a timely manner.  The preferred method to submit questions is by email.  Email provides a record to maintain fair and impartial treatment, so please, submit your questions in a timely manner and by email.  Questions received after close-of-business on 10 November 2011 might not be answered.<br> 	Technically Unacceptable Proposals - Read the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and make sure you address every requirement within the PWS.  You may submit more than one proposal since this is a Commercial Acquisition and there might be more than one-way to fulfill the requirements.  Each proposal MUST stand on its own; the Government will not make any assumptions from one proposal to another.<br> 	Reasonable Price - price that a Prudent and Reasonable person would pay.<br> 	Balanced Price - Price is distributed properly throughout the base and option years.<br> 	CCR - Ensure your Central Contractor Registration is current; go to the website and search for your company by CAGE code and DUNS.<br> 	ORCA - Ensure your Representations and Certifications are current; go to the website and search for your company.<br> 	This office will not open or look at your proposal prior to closing time, so that there is no way to tell if you have done something wrong.<br> <br>9.  Questions and Answers:<br> 	Do we need to tell you who did we asked for references?<br>o	Answer - Yes, we need to have all the information requested in the solicitation for each reference.<br><br> 	How do we interpret the highlighted text in the Amendment?<br>o	Answer - The highlighted text in the amendment shows the area that was changed from the original issued solicitation.<br><br>The following are questions received after the pre-proposal meeting.  <br> 	I am concerned about getting the correct format PDF or Word program that is going to be compatible and legible for the government to view on a CD that we are to provide with the solicitation.<br>I have noticed on occasion within my own letters sometimes the font changes and or lines are adjusted slightly when I open them on different office programs from different computers.<br>I am wondering if I would be able to bring in my contract prior to the deadline and make sure the government is able to open it ok and view the pages on the CD before it is submitted? <br>o	Answer - First and foremost, the Government has requested a hard copy of your proposal, which will be used in the evaluation.  Secondly, when you submit your CD please annotate what program version you're using on the CD label. The Government is not able to accommodate at this time individuals coming in to validate that a CD is viewable.<br><br> 	Question about submitting a proposal from 2 separate companies, Owned by same persons.<br>o	Answer - Each company can submit its own proposal, even if owned by the same individual.  Each proposal MUST stand on its own; the Government will not make any assumptions from one proposal to another.  <br><br> 	I would like to clarify on the pricing portion of this solicitation to make sure I fill it out correctly. On the Net Amount at the end of each item do we just carry the (Amount total down?), for example: ITEM NO 2008 let's say we wanted to charge $1.00 per jumpstart would this be the proper way to input it on the solicitation?<br>ITEM NO.     Service       Quantity       Unit         Unit Price       Amount<br> 2008           Jump Start     2                 each          $1.00          $2.00<br><br>                                                                         NET AMOUNT $2.00<br>Is that the correct way to input it? <br>o	Answer - Yes.<br><br>o	And would that price still be considered in balance, reasonable & not considered a buy in?<br><br>The Government can't answer if the above price is balanced, reasonable & not considered a buy-in at this time without further evaluation.  When the Government is considering a proposal the following guidance from the Federal Acquisition and other sources are considered.<br> 	Buy in - The contract price is considered binding.  Offer prices you will be able to work with for the contract duration and do not expect adjustments after contract award.<br> 	Balanced pricing - The offer is balanced when the price is properly distributed throughout the life of the contract by base and option years.  The Government will question an increase in price not consistent with market conditions (for example inflation, level of competition, and other factors).<br> 	Reasonable price - represents a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the competitive market.  The Government will follow the guidance of FAR 15.404-1(b) - prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.  The Government may also use:<br> 	 Comparison of proposed prices to historical prices paid, whether by the Government or other than the Government, for the same or similar items.<br> 	Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks (such as dollars per pound or per horsepower, or other units) to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry.<br> 	Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates.<br> 	Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items.<br> 	Analysis of data other than certified cost or pricing data provided by the offeror.<br> 	Value analysis.<br><br> 	I didn't quite understand the quantity 2 because of 2 contractors were being awarded the contract explanation at the meeting.<br>o	Answer - The quantity of 2 in the CLINs is for administrative purpose, to make it easier at time of award due to software issues.  A quantity of 2 is used so that the  Government can award 2 separate contracts with the software program used to write the contracts.<br><br> 	If we sub-contract out the B and C class tows, will our sub-contractors receive gate passes as well or how does that work?<br>o	Answer - Yes.  Refer to Local Terms and Conditions, paragraph 3.4, Identification of contractor employees - RapidGate  program.  The cost associated with the RapidGate  program are also explained in the addendum to Local Instructions 3.4.<br><br> 	Do the copies of SF 1449 and SF 30 have to have signatures on them for the electronic copies we submit on CD-ROM or can just the hard copies be signed?<br>o	Answer - The requirement is an original signature with your submitted paper versions of your proposal.  A digital signature is desired but not required.<br><br> 	We have completed our representations and certifications in ORCA, but I do not see FAR Provision 52.209-7 in the list of provisions.  Where do you find this provision and where do I find DFARS Provision 252-212-7000.  Neither of these provisions are in our records with ORCA and I was unable to locate where to find these provisions in ORCA or on the BizOpps website?<br>o	Answer - references to FAR Clause 52.209-7 this clause was deleted in amendment 0001.  All clauses and provisions can be found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil .  Assistance with ORCA website can be found at https://orca.bpn.gov/help/help.aspx .  DFAR Clause 252.212-7000 is not covered under ORCA and has to be filled out and submitted with your proposals.<br><br> 	What is the "Net Amt" on the proposal - is the amount just carried down to the Net Amt?<br>o	Answer - Yes. Net amount is the total amount<br><br> 	Are there Amendments to the Solicitation that requires our signature on the SF30 front page?  If so where do I find SF30 (Standard Form 30) to be able to complete the front page?<br>o	Answer - Yes, amendment(s) require a signature.  Amendment(s) is/are posted at http://www.lewis.army.mil/doc/SOLIC.htm . Currently, there is one amendment that has been issued/posted to the above website and the FedBizOpps website https://www.fbo.gov .<br><br> 	Do we submit Past Performance Information with our proposal or do you contact our References to get the information or both?  If we have a reference complete a past performance questionnaire, do we submit this with our proposal or have the questionnaire e-mailed to you?<br>o	Answer - Past Performance information is required to be submitted with your proposal.  Please refer to Instructions to Offerors paragraph C-4.3, Past Performance for complete instructions.<br><br> 	Where will the questions and answers be posted and when will be able to review these questions and answers?<br>o	Answer - The minutes will be posted on FedBizOpps and the MCO-MICC-JBLM website, http://www.lewis.army.mil/doc no later than close of business on 15 November 2011.<br><br> 	We had a question about the pricing.  It is my recollection that a statement was made, at the Pre-Conference meeting held Monday November 7th, that in the past, items to be bid were left blank if they were going to be done at no charge.  The statement was made to mark those line items with a zero ($0.00) instead of leaving blank.  My question:  Is it acceptable to bid lines at $0.00 without violating EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD as noted on page 109 of 123 under Basis for Contract Award item 1.2 which states Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted.  The Government will evaluate proposed prices for reasonableness, in accordance with FAR 15.402(a), using price analysis techniques.  Unreasonably high, unrealistically low, unbalanced, inaccurate or incomplete price proposals, may be the grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.  My intention is to provide a fair accurate proposal.  Obviously I want to submit a competitive bid but do not want to leave myself exposed for a competitor to undercut me because I was unaware I could provide a lower bid in areas that are rarely performed.<br>o	The Government will question a price that deviates significantly from commercial market practices.  A price of $0.00 is acceptable if it is a normal business practice to offer the product or service free of charge.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled KSC NASA EXCHANGE RFI- FOODSERVICES which was posted on November 01, 2011. You are notified that the followingchanges are made: RFI - NASA Exchange Food Services, Additional Facts.The due date for responses is not extended.The following information is provided to clarify the expected food service needs at KSCand to assist industry in responding to the RFI. 	The selected food service provider(s) is expected to start operations on October1, 2012 with a phase-in period to be determined at award. 	The KSC workforce is projected at approximately 9,000 employees (civil servants,contractors, tenants, and construction personnel) and is expected to remain stable. Inaddition, employees located at Cape Canaveral Air force Station (CCAFS) also have accessto KSC facilities. CCAFS is located approximately 3 miles from the KSC industrial area. 	KSC is divided into the industrial and Launch Complex (LC)  39 areas.Approximately 50% of KSCs total population resides in each area respectively. By themiddle of 2012, the approximate populations of the major facilities at KSC will be: 	Operations and Support Building (OSB) I- 720 	Operations and Support Building (OSB) II - 700	Headquarters (HQ) - 1200 	Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) - 750	Operation and Checkout (O&C) 900All other employees are located in smaller buildings throughout both areas or performwork in outside facilities. 	The following demographic information is based on the current civil servicepopulation at KSC:Occupation Distribution:63% - Science & Engineering29% - Professional Administration2%   - Clerical 6%   - TechnicianIn addition to the above occupation breakout for current civil service employees, it isprojected that between 200 -300 construction workers are anticipated at KSC and expectedto remain steady.Gender Distribution:	67%  -	Male	33%  -	FemaleAge Distribution: 10% - 20-29 years old14% - 30-39 years old35% - 40-49 years old33% - 50-59 years old8%   - 60+    years old	Currently, approximately 35% of KSCs total workforce utilizes cafeteriaservices. In a recent employee focus group, employees indicated that they are willing totravel and increase their participation for quality food. 	Employees work schedules at KSC vary depending on the type of tour or agreementthe supervisor selects. However, many employees are on flex schedules, which allowemployees to vary their arrival and/or departure times. Under some policies, employeesmust work a prescribed number of hours (80) a pay period and be present during a dailycore time (9am  3pm). There are also employees that work 2nd and 3rd shifts depending onthe nature of work and mission requirements. 	There are six available full service cafeterias, a central kitchen facility thatcan recommence as a full service cafeteria, and a catering kitchen located in OSBII.Below are the estimated dimensions of each facility:Industrial area:	Headquarters:  10130 ft	Operation & Checkout (O&C):  4130 ft	Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF):  10990 ft	Central Production Kitchen (CPK):  14370 ftLC-39 area:	Multi-Functional Facility (MFF):  11240 ft	Logistics Building:  1879 ft	Assembly Refurbishment Facility (ARF)/ USA:  2779 ft	The following are construction projects that may affect food services:	Theres currently a budget request to build a new central campus building at KSC,which includes plans for a 15000 ft cafeteria. If the budget for the project isapproved, the building is scheduled to be completed around 2015-2016. This plan includesthe demolition of the headquarters building after the new building is completed. 	The O&C building is scheduled to undergo fire suppression upgrades beginningOctober 2012 with an estimated completion date of February 2013. 	It is anticipated that current food service Government Furnish Equipment (GFE)will be transferred to the Concessionaire to manage and utilize, if necessary. Equipmentand facility operations and maintenance will be negotiated. 	Theres currently a Sharp Data Wizard Point of Sale (POS) system and two mobilefood canteens that are expected to transfer to the selected Concessionaire to utilize forfood service operations, if desired. A complete equipment list will be provided in theRequest for Proposal. 	At a minimum, the concessionaire will be required to open and serve breakfast andlunch. The current operational hours are 6:30am  9:30am for breakfast and 11:00am 1:00pm for lunch. However, a recent employee survey recommended extending breakfast andlunch hours of operation. 	Currently, sanitation inspections are completed monthly. However, the frequencyof inspections is at the discretion of the KSC Public Health Officer, or his/herdesignee. 	Most catering events are held in the O&C Mission Briefing Room (MBR), KennedyLearning Institute (KLI), OSB II, Beach house, Kennedy Athletic, Recreation, and Social(KARS) Parks I & II, and conference rooms throughout the Center.

<DESC>This modification extends the date for submission of the SF-330 packages through 01/11/2010.<br /><br />This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. These services will be acquired in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. AE services are required for two (2) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for commissioning services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Silver Spring, MD.
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Western Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as other NOAA locations in the Pacific including: America Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas Islands, Republic of Palau and Wake Island.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Eastern Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Washington D.C., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of commissioning services is to ensure existing and new facilities are provided with properly designed and energy efficient systems prior to facility acceptance. Additionally commissioning services ensure the staff is provided with proper systems documentation, receive adequate training, and understand proper maintenance procedures. The services sought under this contract include a selected range of Architectural and Engineering (AE) services for commissioning, re-commissioning, and other engineering services to DOC/NOAA building systems. In this context, "systems" refer to systems and equipment to be evaluated or commissioned and will be further defined under each issued Task Order (T.O.). The best qualified firm will be selected to provide commissioning support services in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering, including but not limited to, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and controls, plumbing, seawater systems, laboratory fume hood exhaust systems, fire alarm and protection systems; electrical engineering, including but not limited to, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), emergency generator, radio systems, fire and burglar alarm systems; energy efficiency audits; life cycle cost analysis; value engineering; building control and automation systems; lighting systems; building systems; specialty items, including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV); and environmental engineering, including but not limited to storm water management, site utility studies, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) certification, site investigation and analysis. A general knowledge of other technical disciplines (e.g., architectural and geological) could be required to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>NOAA and its Line Offices have ongoing and continuous requirements to commission newly constructed buildings, and to re-commission existing buildings. Before a newly constructed building is accepted by DOC/NOAA, various building systems, in particular its energy systems, such as HVAC, emergency generators, and Automatic Transfer Switches, are commissioned (i.e., tested for functionality, and in the case of HVAC, efficiency is measured, and air flow rates tested and balanced). Typically, a few weeks after a successful commissioning inspection, the building is declared suitable for beneficial occupancy, and DOC/NOAA takes possession of the building. Because new facilities are being added to DOC/NOAA's inventory each year, the demand for commissioning services is required continuously.</p>
<p>Similarly, when an existing building's HVAC system, or its controls are significantly upgraded or replaced, the HVAC system is usually re-commissioned prior to accepting the work as complete.</p>
<p>The Government shall seek the most highly qualified firm. Cost will not be used as an evaluation criteria for offers.</p>
<p>Under the IDIQ contracting scheme mentioned above, the upper limit of the 5 year life of each of the two (2) contracts will be less than $4,500,000.00. The minimum guaranteed amount will be no less than $100,000.00. Each Task Order (T.O.) under this contract will have its own negotiated cost.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must have a sufficient number of personnel knowledgeable and current with the responsibilities of a commissioning agent, as described in the latest LEED standards for New Construction. The successful offeror must have on his staff, and provide resumes for: <br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agents with expertise in HVAC systems and controls, plumbing, emergency generators, and automatic transfer switches, and demonstrated ability to perform well as an on-site inspector, especially in the role of a commissioning agent;<br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agent with expertise in electrical systems, lighting systems and controls, telecommunications and alarm systems, and experience serving as a commissioning agent or in support of a commissioning agent;<br />The above personnel should be willing to travel anywhere there are DOC/NOAA facilities, based on project schedules requiring commissioning services. Additional personnel with commissioning experience, and depth of experience of all personnel, shall be taken into account during the selection process.<br />The successful offeror must also have additional staff to provide other areas of expertise as required, including the ability to design and/or replace systems found to be inadequate.<br />This IDIQ contract will be issued for a period of 5 years. During this time, the offeror must continue to provide excellent services.<br />The present IDIQ commissioning contract expires on March 14, 2010. The projected performance period of this acquisition is expected to be May 2010 - May 2015. <br />The successful firm must be able to perform work anywhere within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories, though it is expected that most work will occur in the region related to their award, as stated above.</p>
<p>The minimum ordering limitation for this contract shall be $10,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation shall be $1,000,000.00 for any single task order in a given calendar year. <br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this action are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>A. Demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience in performing a full range of commissioning services, including examples of specialized experience in the commissioning of newly constructed buildings, conducting energy audits and HVAC studies and related analysis and design, supporting a LEED submittal as a third party commissioning agent, and the re-commissioning of a commercial building after HVAC controls have been replaced.</p>
<p>B. Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to this commissioning contract, with emphasis on commissioning experience and professional certifications and licenses for key personnel, including consultants and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>C. Recent past performance on Federal Government projects, requiring commissioning services similar to those described in the Scope of Work.</p>
<p>D. Demonstrated capability to provide recommendations and work efficiently and constructively with other AE firms and contractors when deficiencies are discovered.</p>
<p>E. Demonstrated plan and capacity of the firm to manage multiple concurrent projects across the country.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall be required to confirm they satisfy all of the following requirements to be eligible to contract with the Government:</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office for&nbsp;sustaining engineering services&nbsp;for V-22 Operational Test Program Sets (OTPSs) with related technical support, software and technical data.&nbsp; The OTPSs are comprised of Weapon Replaceable Assembly (WRA) and Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) TPSs. (See attached list)&nbsp; These OTPSs will provide test capability for the Units Under Test (UUTs) when used in conjunction with the test station and ancillary equipment and hosted on the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) and Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS) at the Intermediate and Depot Levels of maintenance for the V-22 Aircraft.&nbsp; These services are required until the OTPSs are fully transitioned to the Fleet Support Team (FST) from Bell-Boeing in support of the 19 WRA manufacturers. This effort requires in-depth knowledge and expertise in the area of integration with regard to UUT and OTPS development which only Bell-Boeing currently possesses. The Government does not possess the data for the OPTSs and the UUTs are still under development. It is anticipated that a Basic Ordering Agreement&nbsp;will be issued&nbsp;for this requirement.&nbsp; The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a response which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract.

A26.
 It is possible.  It is expected the Naval War College will present a class each Tuesday evening from 1700-2000 during the Fall and Spring academic semesters.

Q27. As a public university, how should we measure company size status? Can we provide you with the dollar value of our total operating budget? The number of employees? Both of these indicators? Or some other indicator of company size?
