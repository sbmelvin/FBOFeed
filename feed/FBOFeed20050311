<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration & Customs Enforcement intends to negotiate a three-month extension, for the period of April 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005, with the incumbent contractor, The Geo Group, to manage and operate Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located at United States Naval Air Station (USNAS) Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba.  The NAICS Code is 561612 and the Size Standard is $10.5 million.  The Geo Group, Inc. is presently providing services for all operational aspects of the MOC related to safety, security and accountability of the migrant population. Services provided include operation and management of the migrant population according to security and other classification considerations: intake/release procedures; maintenance of a perpetually current electronic population roster, housing and job assignments; accountability through direct observation, physical counts, development and enforcement of migrant rules and responsibilities; control of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) secure perimeter; transportation of migrants in contractor owned vehicles to programs and service on GTMO; and facilitating the delivery of programs and services by government organizations or representatives.  The performance location is one of the most secure and remote military bases in the world. Employee recruitment is difficult due to isolation of the performance location and potential separation from family. The three-month extension is required to award a new contract with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2005. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions pertaining to the publication shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to Linda.Holder@dhs.gov or FAX to 949-360-3013.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a one-year base period, plus four pre-priced one-year options.  The base period will run from 01 October 2005 to 30 September 2006.  Option Year One is from 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007.  Option Year Two is from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2008.  Option Year Three is from 1 October 2008 through 30 September 2009.  Option Year Four is from 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2010.  The requirement is for bird management and control services to eliminate or minimize bird hazards for safe air and ground support operations at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.  These measures may include, but are not limited to, the use of border collies, radio controlled model airplanes, harassment, trapping, relocation, depredation, airfield/airdrome patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring.   The Government will provide an on-base facility and two government-owned transceivers for communication with Control Tower and Airfield Management.  National Agency Checks will be required for employees requiring access to the Local Area Network.    The NAICS code is 561710 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) $6,000,000.00.  In accordance with FAR 19.1300, this solicitation will be issued as a 100% HubZone set-aside.   Evaluation for award will be Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 13 April 2005 and will close on or about 16 May 2005.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.    IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Chuck Peck (302) 677-3744, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at Charles.Peck@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 future Lot buys (envisioned for Lots 20-25 (FY06-11)) Production/Sustainment Program, System Improvement Program (SIP), and the Technical Support Program (FY08-FY11).  The Air-to-Air Missile Systems Wing (AAMSW), in preparation for its 20th production run of AMRAAM AIM-120 missiles is envisioned to award sole source contract(s) for Production/Sustainment, including SIP, and Technical Support (FY08-FY11) for the AIM-120 variants.  SIP includes the design, development, integration, and test improvements for production incorporation into the AIM-120 variants to  improve system effectiveness in future combat environments, which must meet the requirements of the AMRAAM Missile Performance Specifications (MPS).  Also included in the above program is Total Systems Program Responsibility (TSPR), which is defined as the contractor's acceptance of responsibility to do what is necessary and sufficient to deliver, warrant, and support missiles that are affordable, combat capable, and readily available.  Any solicitation/award is anticipated to incorporate a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) for any/all supplies and services necessary for the production (Lots) and sustainment (FY) of the AIM-120 missile.  The solicitation/award is expected to include a basic period (Lot 20/FY06), and five option periods (Lot 21/FY07, Lot 22/FY08, Lot 23/FY09, Lot 24/FY10, and Lot 25/FY11).  Technical Support is planned to be a separate contract series with options (FY08-FY11).  Specific production/sustainment requirements, in addition to the underlying TSPR concept, may include, but are not limited to: AIM-120C7 and AIM-120D missiles (USAF/USN/USA/USMC), AIM-120 missile variants authorized for release to Foreign Military Sales (FMS), sustainment (including repair and a Service Life Prediction Program), associated spares and support/support items [i.e., program management/engineering/ logistics/ test support, support equipment, spares, (FMS) offset administration and associated data].  The Technical Support Program includes providing technical support to AMRAAM AIM-120 production in various areas of systems engineering, software, test, aircraft integration, and logistics.  Total missile production is expected to be from a minimum of 300 up to a maximum of 900 missiles per year.  Deliveries for Lot 20 are anticipated to begin Oct 07 at a rate of approximately 20 missiles per month; deliveries for subsequent lots, at rates of approximately 40 missiles per month, are anticipated as follows:  Lot 21- Oct 08, Lot 22 - Oct 09, Lot 23 - Oct 10, Lot 24 - Oct 11, and Lot 25 - Oct 12.  Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include a 1-lot repair capability that covers non-warranted missile and support item repair for a 12-month period, starting with an option in FY06 and subsequent options for FY07-FY11.  The Technical Support is planned to be a separate contract series with a basic and options for four 12-month periods covering FY08-FY11 requirements.  Inasmuch as Raytheon Company, the current producer and sustainment provider of the AIM-120 missiles is in current production, the Government will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment/technical data package to any prospective new source.  Therefore, the fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Anticipated date of letter of solicitation for Lots 20-25 production and sustainment is on or about Apr 05; date of closing response is on or about Jun 05.  This acquisition is contemplated sole source under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)) to Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Rd, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Mr. Tom Gillman (Raytheon Co.) at the above address or phone (520) 794-9794.  The date for response to this synopsis for the AIM-120 PRODUCTION/ SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM, SIP, and TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROGRAM is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication. Note:  This synopsis supercedes the synopsis released in December 2004 under Solicitation Number FA8675-05-C-0127, which is no longer valid.  Facsimile responses or requests to the Contracting Officer at (850) 882-8050 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt.

<DESC>17.	The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source fixed-price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12.  This action is under the authority of FAR 6.302.1, only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The USCG intends to purchase a total of 60,000 magazines for the SIGARMS Incorporated P229R-DAK handgun, with options to purchase up to an addition 60,000 magazines for this handgun over the following four years.  SIGARMS Incorporated is located at 18 Industrial Drive, Exeter, NH 03110.  SIGARMS was awarded a contract to provide handguns to all DHS armed security officers following stringent handgun testing, and the USCG is transitioning to this new handgun as the standard service sidearm.  The magazines for the SIGARMS P229R-DAK handguns were also tested as part of the DHS contract and meet the stringent specifications set forth by the company for their firearms.  The use of magazines by any other company would affect the reliability, durability, and safety of the SIGARMS handguns that have been procured by the USCG, and would also void the warranty that is provided by SIGARMS for these handguns.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Invoicing Instructions:   In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Marine Corps, has determined that Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) will be used to accomplish electronic invoicing.  Introduction:  Wide Area Work Flow is a web-based invoicing and ac! ceptance system that enables Vendors (Contractors) to submit their invoices electronically to the receiver of the supplies or services.  The receiver receives an email notification and then can log in and perform the necessary acceptance requirements.  Once the acceptance portion is completed, the invoice and acceptance are forwarded to DFAS for processing.   Benefits:  This paperless system prompts the receiver to perform the acceptance functions, an area that has traditionally been the weak link in the invoice processing chain.  Invoices and acceptance functions can be tracked on line without further correspondence. Registration:  Vendors must register at:  https://wawf.eb.mil A “How To” Guide exists at: http://www.disa.mil/acq/wawf/guide.doc Tutorial:  A tutorial for using WAWF  is available at: http://www.wawftraining.com For first-time users:  The “E-Business Point of Contact” listed in your company’s profile in CCR must contact the DISA Helpdesk to register your CAGE (BINCs) Code.  The phone number for the help desk is 866 618-5988. Information required for submitting invoices electronically: 1)	CAGE Code:  Commercial And Government Entity Code (note: the name is being changed to a “BINCs” Code) – Assigned when a vendor registers in Central Contractor Registration. 2)	Contract Number:  This number appears in block #2 of the SF1449.   3)	Order Number:   This number appears in block #4 of the SF1449.  It may be blank.  Normally much of the information from the contract will populate many of the fields.  If this does not occur, the required information can be obtained from the contract. 4)	Payment DoDAAC:  This can be obtained from block 18a, in the box marked “code” (i.e. M67443) 5)	Ship to code:  This number may appear in block 15, or appear in the shipping information.  Traditionally, but not always, it is the first six characters of the Requisition Number that generally appears in block #1 of the SF1449  (Note:  Generally the ship to code is NOT M00681). Vendors must use the “Combo” Invoice/Receiving Report when submitting invoices for supplies, and the 2 in 1 invoice when submitting invoices for services. Vendors are also encouraged to select the “send email notification” option prior to submitting invoices.  This alerts the receiver that they have an invoice to certify.   If the “Ship to code” does not have an “acceptor” please contact MSgt William Hepler at 760 725-3418 or by email at william.hepler@usmc.mil.  Copies of the Representations and Certifications, as well as any of the previously mentioned provisions and clauses may be found at the following web site:  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.    Quotes are due by 4:00 pm (Pacific Daylight Time) on 17 March 2005.  Contact the Contracting Officer, Loretta Nared at 760.725.8133 or loretta.nared@usmc.mil, for any additional inquiries. Quotes may be submitted by facsimile transmission.  Facsimile quotes are subject to the same rules as paper quotes.  The telephone number of receiving facsimile equipment is 760-725-8445. The Government reserves the right to make award solely on the facsimile quote.  The complete original quote shall be submitted if requested by the Contracting Officer. Quoters bear the burden of ensuring that quotes (and any authorized modifications) reach the designated office on!  time and should allow a reasonable time for facsimile transmissions to be completed.  All pages of the quote must reach the office before the deadline specified in this solicitation.  Pages of a facsimile transmission that arrive in the office after the specified deadline will not be considered.  The quoter bears the risk of non-receipt of facsimile transmissions and should confirm by telephone that any facsimile was received.  Any facsimile transmission must clearly state the solicitation number and the name of the Contracting Officer on the first page to ensure proper receipt.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the Low Price Technically Acceptable offeror.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: (1)	Technical Capability (2)	Past performance (3)	Price  In order to be rated “Technically Acceptable” overall, the proposal must be rated “Technically Acceptable” in the evaluation factors Technical Capability and Past Performance.  Offerors that are rated “Technically Unacceptable” on Technical Capability will not be evaluated for Past Performance and will not be considered for contract award. (1)  Technical Capability of the item(s) offered to meet the government requirement  To be determined technically acceptable, the Offeror must meet all the minimum specifications/standards stated in the purchase description for Item 0001.  Offerors shall (a) furnish technical information, which may include technical specifications, product literature/brochures and photos to demonstrates or confirm that the offeror meets all aforementioned minimum specifications and (b) provide a statement or explanation to demonstrate how it will meet the required delivery schedule.  Failure to meet anyone of the minimum specifications and the required delivery date will render the proposal “Technically Unacceptable”. (2) Past Performance Offeror's Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least 3 of its most current and relevant contracts.  Current is defined as a contract (or subcontract) in-progress or a contract (or subcontract) completed within the last 3 years.  Relevant is defined as a contract that is current and also any Federal, State, or local government, or private contract that is for items similar and/or identical to those required under this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Quotes which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. For each contract provided as a reference, the Offeror should provide the following information: CONTRACT INFORMATION Contract Number:             							 Date Completed: Contract Type:                Fixed Price 		 Cost Reimbursement                        Other (Specify) Item Description and Quantity: Customer Name:                			Customer POC: (Person who can verify data) Address:                      Telephone:                              FAX: QUALITY NOTE:  An explanation must accompany all answers with an asterisk(*). Was consideration or a monetary withhold for non-conforming supplies/services or late deliveries assessed against this contract?     YES *  (Explanation)                             NO Was/is any part of this contract terminated for default and/or in litigation?                            YES *   (Explanation)                           NO         Was any warranty work completed on delivered items?                           YES *      (Explanation)                          NO Did you receive any quality awards in the past three years?                         YES *     (List Awards)                         NO TIMELINESS Were all items delivered within the original contract schedule? YES       NO *       (Explanation) The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: (a) Neutral:  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available may receive a neutral rating for past performance. The evaluation of past performance will take in account past performance information regarding timely delivery of a quality product conforming to the solicitation/contract requirements. The Government reserves the right to review past performance information and if deficient in demonstrating an "acceptable" risk, rate the past performance either as "neutral" or "unacceptable."  The Offeror must provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  An Offeror failing to provide the past performance information or to assert that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance may be considered ineligible for award. (b) Acceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts met contractual requirements.  The Offeror’s past performance record leads to an expectation of adequate performance, with little risk anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Offeror's past performance. (c) Unacceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts did not meet most contractual requirements.  Offeror’s past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved.  Significant potential risk is anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Offeror's past performance. (3) Price (a) Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Performance risk assessments may be conducted as appropriate in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d)(3).  The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of total aggregate price of all items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all items.  Quotes shall:   1) Show the proposed unit price and/or extended price.  In case of discrepancy between a unit price and an extended price, the unit price will be presumed to be correct.  (b) An offeror must propose a price on all sizes/quantities. Any quote failing to do so will not be considered for award   The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  Note: In evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (1) to be technically acceptable, Factor (2), Past Performance, is approximately equal to Factor (3), Price.  However, the degree of importance of price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals with regard to Past Performance.  Each initial quote should contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  The government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.   After an initial evaluation of proposals in accordance with 52.212-2, FISC San Diego intends to conduct an on-line anonymous competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by a third-party reverse auction provider, Procuri.com (www.govauctions.procuri.com).

These VXI power supplies were previously manufactured by AMC and are part of the Submarine Low Frequency/Very Low Frequency VMEbus Receiver (SLVR), AN/WRR-12 and AN/WRR-12A currently installed aboard U.S. Navy submarines. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Authority for other-than-full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The use of any other source for this acquisition would violate manufacturer proprietary information and would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor's workforce, which would result in substantial added cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 335311; the size standard is 750 employees.  The anticipated period of performance will be approximately a three-year base period with two one-year options with a total estimated value of $585,000. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to LCDR Patrick Ingram, SC, USN at pat.ingram@navy.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources to expand the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) Digital Trunking Radio System (DTRS). This Mobile Communications Network Upgrade expansion requires hand-held radios, mobile radios, control room, secondary switch, and base station. The existing mobile communications equipment was manufactured by European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS) of France and uses the EADS proprietary data encryption technique. RSAF plans to extend the existing EADS system (MATRACOM 9600 Mobile Communications System) used for voice and data communications. The system upgrade will use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment operating in 440 MHz-490MHz frequency band. The end-to-end encrypted Mobile Communications Network [1] shall consist of a Control Room, Secondary Switch, and Base Station compliant with TETRAPOL standard. All equipment [2] shall be fully digital, end-to-end encrypted and interoperable with the existing MATRACOM 9600 Digital Trunking Radio System provided by EADS. The system design [3] shall be based on Non-Developmental Items (NDI) COTS equipment. All mobile, handheld, base station and switch equipment [4] shall be modular construction using solid-state components. ESC intends to purchase 1 base station, 1 secondary switch, 1 control room, 39 mobile radios, and 132 handheld radios. A portion of the 132 radios will be required to be intrinsically safe (will not ignite explosive vapors). The Government is seeking sources for this equipment that [5] shall be delivered and installed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this synopsis. The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on 31 March 2005 to the following address (for first class or overnight mail): OC2SG/PK, Attn: Jerome McDonald, 11 Barksdale Street., Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1700.  The response should not exceed five (5) one-sided, 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.  It should be noted that the Statement of Work (SOW) for this project will not be posted on the HERBB.  Qualified companies, who provide responses to this Sources Sought, will be provided a copy of the SOW upon request to the Contracting Officer.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works, Housing, and Communications, Plot 4/6 Airport Road, P.O. Box 10, Entebbe, Uganda, Attention: Eng. Dr. Godfrey Kibuuka, Phone: +256-41.32.0599/+256-71.94.07611; Fax: +256-41.32.01.35. The Grantee, the Ministry of Housing, Works, and Communications of Uganda (MOWHC), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a National ICT Master Plan and e-Government Network Feasibility Study, the first step in the Government of Uganda's effort to implement their recently developed National ICT (Information and Communications Technology) Policy.

The MOWHC is responsible for the coordination of the implementation of the national ICT policy.  To begin this effort, the MOWHC commissioned a study through a local firm to assess the e-readiness of the country, which was completed in early 2004.  The study concluded that despite government will and mandate, the growth of ICT in Uganda is hampered by funding, investments, and affordability.  One of the recommendations of this study is to develop an ICT Master Plan for the implementation of the national ICT policy while optimizing existing funding, and to raise additional funding through private sector interests, donors, and multilateral loans.  The objective of the study would be to develop an ICT roadmap to develop and support e-governance and e-business.  

A summary of the Terms of Reference for this project is as follows.  A full Terms of Reference for this study can be found in Annex 6 of the RFP.

Task 1: Development of the Uganda ICT Master Plan: Through meetings with key ministries in the Ugandan Government, the team will develop a Master Plan that clearly demonstrates action plans to carry out key policy objectives outlined by the National ICT Policy.

Task 2: Requirements Analysis: The team will conduct a requirements analysis for four ministries and produce a report that pairs the requirements with potential technologies and infrastructure designs.

Task 3: Architecture and Standards Development: The team will develop a national strategy and high-level architecture of an ideal network that will also integrate existing resources.  It will then recommend the development of appropriate national standards each agency/ministry would need to implement the architecture. 

Task 4: Implementation and Procurement Plan: This will include the development of a high-level implementation and procurement action plan for the selected ministries.

Task 5: The team will assist in defining and establishing an e-Government Program Management Office that will have the responsibility of implementing the determined implementation plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a U.S. $317,975 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, April 27, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Telecommunication and Information System Command (TISCOM), has a requirement for underway connectivity using the Inmarsat–B leased satellite system.  The communications suite will be installed on the PC-179 class cutter to provide voice (clear and STUIII) service, fax service and data capabilities to 128Kbps.  The United States Coast Guard connectivity architecture employs pre-paid satellite leases on the 2nd generation Inmarsat satellite constellation (98W, 142W, 143.5E, 25E) along with 3rd generation (on-demand services) as an available backup to the primary lease.  Primary Inmarsat-B use is 128Kbps data operation linking the mobile unit to the shore side Land Earth Station (LES).  The LES must backhaul the mobile unit data via terrestrial path to the U.S. Coast Guard network. Variable Bandwidth Service (VBS) allows sharing of one 2nd generation satellite lease between two underway cutters providing simultaneous 24X7 64Kbps thruput to each cutter.   DHS/USCG has concluded their requirements will best be met through a customized configuration.  The system is manufactured by Nera Telecommunications and supported only by Mackay Communications in the United States.  DHS/USCG intends to negotiate with Mackay Communications on a sole source basis.  Mackay Communications is the sole U.S. Distributer of all Nera equipment. Any contractor contemplating this requirement should know that the Inmarsat–B systems must be CN-17 compliant and operate with 2nd and 3rd generation satellites that have LES capabilities to backhaul mobile data to the U.S. Coast Guard data network.  CN-17 compliance is mandatory due to the U.S. Coast Guard purchase of United States Navy’s 2nd generation satellite leases and their associated satellite provider (LES platform).  The requirement must contain the following: 1) Inmarsat-B suite must be CN-17 complaint, 2) high speed data option up to 128Kbps and VBS capable, 3) rotary joint with installation, 4) serial printer, 5) system certification & 2-yr parts/labor warranty,  6) STU III option and 7) storage at vendors site.  Due to immediate USCG operational commitments, delivery must be on or before April 18, 2005.   It is contemplated that award shall be made utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone inquiries will be honored.

<DESC>This procurement is to obtain contractor support to continue collecting data that will further validate the findings of the original Activity-Based Costing (ABC) study completed in November 2004.  TSA intends to solicit on a sole source basis with Grant Thornton, LLC to continue the initial study that proved to be extremely valuable to the organization.  TSA now desires to continue the study by adding additional airports to the model developed.  The original study only included only 15 airports, which in percentage terms is only 3% of the airports with a TSA presence.  In order to further validate the initial findings, additional airports need to be visited and included in the existing ABC model to further refine the results.  The inclusion of additional airports to the ABC model will provide TSA management with a better understanding of what screening services cost, in terms of the activities (work steps) performed.  The ABC data collection method will also be used to evaluate the true cost of operations for those airports that chose to apply for the Screening Partnership Program (SPP).  The period of performance is from April 4, 2005 through September 30, 2005.  NAICS Code 541219 applies to this acquisition.  This announcement is NOT a request for information, nor is the TSA seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Materiel Wing (SY) intends to extend three existing concept study efforts for the Orbital Deep Space Imager (ODSI) Program.  The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, and Northrop Grumman Space Technology were competitively awarded ODSI Concept Study contracts in January 2005 for pre-Phase A activities.  Our intent is to extend these contracts from pre-Phase A to system design review to allow each corporation to continue their pre-Phase A development efforts, hold a System Requirements Review in FY06 and a System Design Review in FY07.  The anticipated award date is 1 August 2005 with a period of performance of 22 months.

Additional qualified companies may submit a written Statement of Capabilities (SOC).  A qualified company is determined to be one whose SOC satisfies requested program requirements and meet the outlined security prerequisites within this announcement.  Interested parties must have a strong understanding of the Space Control mission, the Space Situational Awareness sub-Mission, and how ODSI integrates into these mission areas, including detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems and how to integrate into existing military infrastructure.  Prospective companies must have prior experience serving in a prime contractor role on space programs of similar scope/size as ODSI (responsible for acquisition of space, ground, link, and data dissemination segments; system/component integration and test; spacecraft-to-launch vehicle integration; deployment; initial operational support; and sustainment of a multi-satellite constellation).  The offeror must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including, Top Secret-SCI/SAR.  Interested parties must currently have sufficient numbers of personnel with current Top Secret SSBIs and sufficient Top Secret-SCI accredited special compartmented information facility (SCIF) space to perform System Design Review-level developmental work on a Major Defense Acquisition Program, and have a plan for providing adequate personnel and SCIF space to accomplish ODSI objectives during all phases of the program.

All SOCs should be received within ten (10) days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Interested parties shall submit three (3) copies of their capability statements to the following address:  SMC/SY, Attn: Rudie Galbert, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, Los Angeles AFB, CA 90245; phone 310-416-1508; fax 310-416-1725.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to procure services of a contractor to provide accurate, comprehensive, real-time "commercial" real estate market data, hereafter, “market data” for approximately eight (8) concurrent users located nationally, with the potential to add up to 13 additional users throughout the term of the contract. IRS seeks access via a web-based service database to market data for all major U.S. metropolitan markets and their submarkets.  Additionally, the IRS manages a proprietary location modeling tool that determines the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.  The location modeling tool utilizes Geographic Information System technology and the market data output from the procured web-based service shall be easily transferred to the location model.  The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial building inventory by zip code.  Further, property searches must be conducted in the web-based service database by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database which will then provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area.  Additionally, the web-based service shall allow IRS employees to analyze current and historical market conditions; verify building specific lease terms and conditions, i.e., asking rent rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions; building specific images (floor plans, and exterior and interior building photos); and new construction information.  The information presented shall be timely.  Real-time data is essential.  Also, there shall be a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users' understand the web-based product's capability.  On-going customer support for the term of the contract is also required to answer questions/troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.  This shall be achieved via on-line demonstrations or contractor staffed call sites.  This customer service shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST.  The Period of Performance is one year from date of award. Responsible parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit a written quotation of interest and capability by 12:00 noon EST on the date specified (March 15, 2005). Evaluation/award will be based on the contractor representing the best value to the Government, and cost.  Best value will be demonstrated first and foremost by technically meeting the aforementioned requirements and then cost.  All quotes shall include point of contact (name and telephone number), GSA Contract Number, if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  All questions shall be submitted in writing.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202) 283-1533.  Facsimile responses must contain signatures, arrive at the place and by the time specified in the synopsis and may not exceed 10 pages.  The Government will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of any facsimile information.  No solicitation will be issued; therefore, such request for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration intends to award a contract on a single source basis to Hogan Assessment Systems for the purpose of providing assessment materials in support of candidate selection for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) Program.  

Hogan is the author and publisher of the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI), one of the most widely used measures of normal personality for employee selection. Hogan also publishes the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), which is a technically-sound, well-developed measure of dysfunctional personality characteristics that negatively impact an employee’s performance at work. Both instruments were developed consistent with relevant technical, legal, and professional guidelines and have a substantial amount of validity evidence for similar jobs to the FFDO requirements. 

A change to new instruments would require the re-creation of the entire psychological evaluation process as well as considerable reprogramming and modification to the computerized test delivery system and the information technology infrastructure used by TSA to manage the program.

The ROB has a research laboratory and patient treatment clinic.  The research being performed by the branch has the ability to translate findings into potential treatments to patients with cancer.  One of the studies currently being undertaken by the ROB is to look at and study aging and cancer.  As part of this study the end user requires SirT3 knockout mouse.  The SirT3 knockout mouse is made via a system that randomly knocks out a gene in the genome.  The technique for disrupting the SirT3 knockout mouse is solely licensed to Lexicon Genetics and only available through them.  (Patent number 4,959,317)  Lexicon Genetics is the only known contractor that can provide a SirT3 knockout mouse that is required by the end-user.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide a SirT3 knockout mouse it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The researcher is only interested in the SirT3 knockout mouse and offers of alternative gene knockout mice will not be considered.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on March 21, 2005, faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness Directorate,
Warfighter Training Research Division, (AFRL/HEA) is issuing this solicitation.  
The dramatic transformation in America’s strategic environment demands an equally dramatic transformation in how we prepare the force.  The effects of the transformed strategic environment on the force are many.  The emphasis has shifted from deliberate planning to time-sensitive planning, from permanent organizations to expeditionary organizations, and from large hierarchical organizations to smaller forces capable of operating anywhere, anytime, day or night, and in all weather.  Training must, therefore, transform to support the needs of the force.  Training must prepare the force to learn, improvise, and adapt rather than to merely execute fixed doctrine to standards.  Training Transformation will focus on continuously improving defense readiness by providing dynamic capabilities-based training in support of national security requirements across the full spectrum of service, joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations. The objective of the Warfighter Readiness Science and Technology Program is to research, develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and transition leading edge technologies and methods to improve warfighter readiness and optimize human-centered logistics processes, enabling the expeditionary aerospace force to achieve their mission goals.
Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>PROSTHESIS 2007, SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 4, DUE: 4:00 PM ET 6/1/05. POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4674, Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519. 

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for research, development, system integration and demonstration of an upper extremity prosthetic.  The vision of the Prosthesis 2007 program is to leverage recent research advances in neural sensing, control systems, actuation, power storage and distribution, freeform manufacturing, neural control, microfabrication, sensory feedback, flexure and transmission design, signal processing, and information science to dramatically improve the capability of upper extremity prosthetic limbs beyond those that are currently available commercially.  This vision will be realized by increasing the range of motion, strength, endurance, and dexterity of upper extremity prosthetic devices.  The final product must be ready for human clinical trials including completed submission of an Investigational New Device (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 24 months.

The ultimate goal of this two year effort is to deliver a single prosthetic arm system that is suitable for transhumeral and shoulder disarticulation amputations.  The program is comprehensive and will deliver a prosthetic arm system in two years that is sufficiently mature to enter the appropriate approval processes for general medical use.  Maturity of the prosthetic will be demonstrated by completed submission of an IND application to the FDA by the end of 24 months.  Proposals that do not address the full integration of component technologies into an upper limb prosthesis or do not plan for the appropriate approval process and product commercialization are generally not of interest.  However, the development of enabling technologies of extraordinary promise may be considered for support.  DARPA has separately published BAA 05-26 Revolutionizing Prosthetics.  Prosthesis 2007 (BAA 05-19 Addendum 4) is focused on nearer term improvements in prosthetics capabilities.  Proposers are free to propose to both solicitations independently.

The technical goal of the program is to develop arm prostheses that significantly improve the ability of the arm amputee to perform the activities of daily living.  Design trades and technology choices may dictate that some of the desirable characteristics listed below are not simultaneously achievable, are unnecessary, or are not achievable in two years.  The guiding principle to be used when performing design trades is that the device should deliver the maximum capability possible for the activities of daily living within the two year time frame. Desirable characteristics of the upper arm prosthesis system include (1) inertial properties that match the lost limb including arm free swing capability, (2) local control, state sensing, and task-based mode shifting within the device to enable improved functionality, (3) simultaneous control of 3-5 joints, (4) fingertip force detection, (5) local hand grasp slip control, (6) elbow lift capability of up to 20 ft-lbs, (7) grip strength of up to 25 lbs, (8) wrist flexion strength of up to 1.67 ft-lbs, (9)  a robust intuitive control approach, (10) 24 hour endurance between refuel or recharge while conducting activities for daily living, (11) minimum of three grasp patterns (fine pinch, lateral pinch, power grip), (12) 2 degrees of freedom at the wrist, (13) humeral rotation, (14) effective cosmetic matching to the amputee, (15) noise below 50 dB(A) at 1 meter, (16) water and grit resistance, and (17) an automated system for fitting the prosthetic to the residual limb that accounts for shape and structure changes due to amputee activities and other normal physiological changes.  A level of modularity that will enable adaptation to varying degrees of stump length is also desirable.  

A critical component of a successful effort is a series of technology demonstrations that will occur regularly throughout the two year work period.  These demonstrations will show clear progress toward the goal of delivering a mature arm prosthesis system that meets the requirements for an FDA IND at the end of the two year research and development period.  The series will culminate in a demonstration of the complete functional arm system at the conclusion of the project.  

The formation of multidisciplinary teams with an overall system integrator as the lead institution is essential for effective program planning and execution.  Proposals must describe plans to address the technical, commercial, and regulatory issues pertinent to integration of state of the art technologies into a new medical device.  The emphasis of this two year effort is on the technical aspects of the upper arm prosthesis system.  Commercial development and regulatory approval plans will be used to evaluate the ability of the proposers to ultimately deliver a prosthetic limb that will be widely available to the amputee community.  An optional third year of effort should be proposed for the purpose of performing an early clinical trial.  Only exceptionally successful programs will be considered for support in the third year.  

Each proposal should explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above; include at least five specific, quantitative 12 month technical objectives that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals; and include clear intellectual property arrangements, commercialization plans and transition paths.  Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Proposed efforts should not exceed 24 months plus an optional third year for early clinical trials.  If multiple awards are made a down-selection may occur after 12 months based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.

Only full proposals are being accepted under this addendum.  Proposals shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA05-19 (Parts 1 & 2) of 8 Feb, 2005 (http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm).  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE TO THE ADDRESS SHOWN BELOW NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM ET 1 JUNE 2005.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.  Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BA05-19.  Please refer to the original FedBizOpps announcement for BAA 05-19 (Parts 1 and 2) for general administrative questions.

Proposals involving human use that are selected for funding will be required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a Federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a Federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

<DESC>This is an update to the synopsis/Request For Information entitled "VIRTUAL" SPACE ACADEMY that was posted on August 19, 2004. The August synopsis requested comments and ideas from all sources related to recommendations from the President's Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy. The Commission’s report can be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf  Specifically, the Commission has recommended that the federal government:  - increase the priority of teacher training - provide for better integration of existing math, science, and engineering education initiatives across governments, industries, and professional organizations  - explore options to create a university-based space academy for training the next generation technical work force  In addition, the original RFI contemplated a possible Space Exploration Policy Institute. NASA received numerous responses to the August RFI and has since drafted a preliminary Statement of Work to identify the specific requirements that may be needed. This Preliminary Statement of Work is being released as part of this synopsis update. NASA is considering issuing a Request for Proposals related to this requirement in the next 60-90 days, with a probable single contract award no later than Spring of 2005. NASA anticipates that a pre-proposal conference will be held within one week of RFP release. Potential offerors are invited to review this preliminary SOW and provide questions and comments to the Primary Point of Contact via e-mail by January 24, 2005. The Primary Point of Contact is Karen Smith. Comments should be submitted via email to Karen.M.Smith@nasa.gov. Responses shall include an executive summary and shall be limited to no more than 20 pages.  In addition to general comments, NASA would like comments/feedback on the following items: -	Schedule/Length of contract - How long to put together this model? -	Contract type – NASA is currently contemplating a fixed price contract. -	Challenges associated with the scope of work including partnerships -	Potential cost including the variables that impact cost -	NASA is also seeking ideas on establishing an institute for the study of space exploration policy. This institute would collect a number of interdisciplinary skills from science, engineering, public management and public policy, among others. This new entity would be a resource that could synergistically apply its various expertise to significant space policy matters. The Preliminary SOW, additional updates to this document and other preliminary documentation related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>Synopsis for the Early Detection and Rapid Response Project

The USDA Forest Service is soliciting contractors to sort and identify Scolytidae (bark beetles) from field samples in the North Eastern Region and Southern Region of the United States.  Some samples will be pre-screened and sorted by individuals at the field trapping level, while other samples will have to be identified in full by the contractor to assess the accuracy of the pre-screening.  The final list of identifications and a brief written discussion of results for a given year’s samples should be provided to the Early/Detection coordination team no later than December 15th of each year.  

The contractor must have a graduate degree in entomology with proven experience sorting and identifying Scolytidae species native to North America, 10 target species (Orthotomicus erosus, Ips sexdentatus, Ips typographus, Hylurgops palliatus, Hylurgus ligniperda, Pityogenes chalcographus, Tomicus minor, Tomicus piniperda, Trypodendron domesticum, and Xyleborus spp.), other exotic Scolytidae, and forest insects in general.  Must have the facilities and equipment required to conduct taxonomic identifications and to store specimens in a controlled environment.  

The Government will make two contract awards.  One contract will be awarded for work performed in the Southern Region and one contract will be awarded for work performed in the Northeastern Region.  The contract will be for one (base) year, with the option to renew two additional years.  Government anticipates work to begin on or around May 1, 2005.  This solicitation is opened to small and large schools and universities and to small businesses only.  All information regarding this solicitation will be released to the public on February 25, 2005.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the prevous posting dates 03/04/05.  It provides the questions and answers to twelve technical questions. Answers to the technical questions in response of the RFI posed on 03/03/05 will be posted every Friday until expiration  of response date.  All information contained in the 03/02/05 posting still applies and remains unchanged.  Below please find twelve questions and answers regarding the EQ-36:  EQ-36 Contractor Questions for the week of 11 Mar 05 Question:  Are the system vehicles expected to provide the transportation for the entire crew? Answer:  For sustainment configuration it is required to provide for the transportation of the entire crew.  Contractor is to describe the crew transportation limitations (if any) for the mission essential configuration. Question:  In the RFI section for Interoperability a statement is made The EQ-36 System shall be able to operate with no performance degradation when co-located with other operational counter fire radars.  Can the government provide a list of other count er fire radars?  For example, does the government anticipate EQ-36 and un-modified TPQ-36 radars being used together? Answer:  The statement in the RFI should read The EQ-36 System shall be able to operate with minimal performance degradation when co-located with other operational counter fire radars. The other co-located radars include the AN/TPQ-36, AN/TPQ-37, Light Weight Counter fire Radar (LCMR), and other EQ-36 System radars. Question:  DII COE compliance is stated in the RFI.  What level of DII COE compliance is required? Answer:  IN those areas that deal with interoperability (i.e. Messaging, mapping, communications etc.).  Level 5 compliance is expected as a minimum but the contractor shall describe what is achievable. Question:  Does the government consider prototype to be equivalent to EDM? Answer:  Yes. Question:  How many prototypes are required for delivery? Answer:  The number of prototypes has not been established but a range is considered in paragraph 2 on page 6 of the RFI. Paragraph 2 a on page 6 of the RFI should read 2, 4, 6 systems. Question:  How many LRIP units (low rate initial production) are required for delivery? Answer:  Up to 15 are anticipated at this time. Question:  A production quantity of 100 to 150 units is stated in the RFI.  Please clarify whether the LRIP quantities are included in these amounts? Answer:  The LRIP systems are not included in the production quantity. Question:  Do you currently use any commercial resources for doing online technical research?  If so, can you identify which ones? Answer:  Not Applicable  Question:  Do you have a need to search authoritative sources to find information on electrical engineering subjects such as aerospace electronics, military electronics, nuclear instrumentation, radar and radio communications, antennas and propagation, ele ctric machines, electron tubes. Answer:  No Question:  Do you have a need to search authoritative sources to find information in other technical areas including physics, computers and control and information technology? Answer:  No Question:  For the heavier sustainment configuration it is stated as a requirement that:  A second sustainment configuration &&.requires a shelter that provides crew protection against ballistic nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons.  (We assum e a comma after ballistic) whereas later in the text it is stated for both configurations that:  For each configuration it is mandatory that he EQ-36 System be hardened to protect against loss of critical platform functionality after exposure to physical d estructive threats from conventional explosive ordnance, and to non-conventional ordnance (NBC weapons).  Our interpretation of this is that there is actually no difference in the required protection level for the two configurations.  We believe that this is not the intended interpre tation.  Could you please clarify? Answer:  The contractors interpretation is correct Question:  In the 360 configuration, is the range and accuracy required at all bearings at the same time or are there preferred threat bearings? Answer:  In describing the 360 degree configuration the contractor shall describe any limitation/trade-offs in range and accuracy in the proposed design.

<DESC>RFP Number: W9113M-05-R-0003 The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) supports a Missile Defense Agency requirement for accomplishing lethality testing and assessments.  This effort will define kill modes, determine lethal damage requirements  (LDRs), and develop/validate lethality criteria for threat configurations designated as targets for the Ballistic Missile Defense System elements and components.  Near-term focus is on the Ground Based Midcourse Defense and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems.  This will be do ne through testing and analysis for current Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEW) systems and concepts but also may require the development of LDRs associated with targets for directed energy weapons or small yield nuclear weapons.  Determination of LDRs for the KE I, MKV, Aegis BMD and ABL systems are within the scope of this procurement.  The effort consists of designing, fabricating, instrumenting and testing models of threat payload targets and/or models of interceptors and kill enhancement devices such as rods a nd fragments.  First principle computational analyses consisting of hydrocodes, and/or structural codes are required to develop pre-test predictions, interpret test data and design threat payload and interceptor test models.  These analytical techniques wi ll also be utilized to extend the empirical database beyond current test capabilities and conduct parametric analyses.  Fast-running computer algorithms, which accurately model the critical parameters of the empirical database, are required in this effort for development of lethality criteria, evaluations of interceptor lethality, and other parametric analyses.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 9.5.  The resultant c ontract will be cost plus award fee, level of effort.  The procurement will be full and open competition and will result in one contract award.  It will consist of a one-year basic, four (4) one-year options and a surge option, as well as a Material Option  and Travel Option.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate a subcontractor on  one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award. The purpose of this synopsis is to advise that the Final Request for Proposal (RFP) as well as all the supporting documentation is available at the SMDC website, http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html.  Proposals in response to W9113M-05-R-0003,  are due to this office on 25 April 2005.  Any questions regarding the RFP should be submitted to shirley.wilkes@smdc.army.mil (title email Lethality Testing and Criteria Development) by close of business 25 March 2005.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED, NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION.

<DESC>The following questions have  been presented in writing to the Contract Specialist.  Question 1:  I have a question regarding the amount of projected operating expenses for 2006 of $24,524 per unit. I assume that figure includes the amounts of $8,268  per unit for utilities and $3,663 per unit for maintenance and repair which together total $11,931 per unit.  This leaves $24,524 - $11,931 = $12,593 per unit for the remaining operating expenses which itself is a very high number.  Can you provide additi onal information on what is included in this figure?  Is it possibly money programmed for capital repairs that would be considered operating money in the government sector but capital money in the private sector?  Answer 1:  TOE includes:  utilities, solid  waste management and recycling, maintenance and repair, insurance, capital expenses, salaries and personnel, administration, community life and police & fire reimbursement.  These are costs estimated for 2006, before renovation of the homes.  Question 2:  Renovation Costs - Can they rely on these numbers?  $24,431,000.  Are those costs for just hard construction costs (materials and labor) or do they include soft costs such as A/E design costs?  Answer 2:  These cost estimates are based on comprehensive Fa cility Condition Assessments completed by an engineering firm in September 2003.  These costs were revised and updated by a validation assessment in June 2004.  These estimates should be considered all-in costs that include hard costs, landscaping, ameniti es, contingencies, management fees and other soft costs.  Question 3:  What is the adjusted basis of the 89 historic houses the Government would contribute to this privatization effort?  Answer 3:  The adjusted basis for the homes at Fort Myer and Fort McN air is $5,337,008.  Question 4:  Will there be another site visit?  Answer 4:  No.

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has discovered a simple process that greatly reduces pollutants emitted from coal plants and other emerging coal, biomass, and municipal solid waste energy conversion processes. The process is simple, very economical, efficient, and easy to retrofit on existing plants. The process effectively reduces NOx to nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water, and further provides a sorbent for elemental mercury, mercuric chloride, and many acid gas and halide compounds.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology. It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL has a patent pending on the process, which may be licensed exclusively or non-exclusively. The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before April 4th, 2005. For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy or Richard Boardman:

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to conducting State Systems Technical Reviews of their Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant funded programs and initiatives.

Project Description:  The goal of this project is to provide systems assessments of States’ fiscal, clinical and management components of their Single State Agency (SSAs), which are designated as having responsibility for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders. CSAT is tasked with monitoring States’ administration and utilization of the SAPT Block Grant funds received annually for prevention and treatment and prevention services. States’ adherence to statutory and regulatory requirements is critical to their continued receipt of BG funds. The focus of this procurement will be:
1.	Provide comprehensive Core Technical Reviews (approximately 14-16 per year) of state-wide systems for prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, including fiscal, clinical, and management aspects of each state’s Single State Agency (SSA) program, to include States’ ongoing maintenance of effort in certain set-aside domains, including HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, services for pregnant women and women with children.
 2.  Provide comprehensive reports on all Core Technical Reviews following the reviews, which will include analyses of the various components of each State’s systems of care, as noted above, and a list of recommendations for technical assistance that could serve to enhance their services capability and contribute to State’s capacity for development of Corrective Action Plans, the goal of which is the capacity to effectively report on the recently established National Outcome Measures (NOMs). Report Drafts will be reviewed and approved by State Project Officers and the GPO prior to being sent to the State for their review and comments or corrections. 
        3.  Conduct State Requested Reviews (approximately 16-18 per year); these optional Reviews will relate to topics that are timely and significant for each State, affecting some aspect of the substance abuse treatment system, particularly as it inter-relates with other state systems, such as criminal justice or health. Reports will be written and approved by the GPO prior to being sent to the SSA Director.

<DESC>On 11 March 2004, on behalf of the Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC), Port Hueneme, CA, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Contacts Office  posted a notice to the FedBizOpps web site seeking information on commercial sources for truck bodies including: 1,500-gal fuel distributors; 2,000-gal water distributor, field service, asphalt distributor, earth auger, tier and lube service, and aerial platform. Based on the responses received to sources sought notice, NFELC believes that standard commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) bodies will meet the Navy’s special purpose vehicle requirements and where they do not, minor changes to the design/configuration (i.e., modified-COTS) will yield acceptable results.  As such, it is intended to use commercial products, processes and practices to reduce development, production and operational support costs. NFELC is now seeking industry comments on a draft specification for the fuel, water and asphalt distributors, earth auger and field service bodies.  Potential vendors will have an opportunity to address:  (1) Whether the specification will yield COTS/modified-COTS solutions; (2) Their ability to meet specified requirements; (3) If there are specific items requiring clarification for responsive industry proposals; and, (4) Specified requirements that unnecessarily drive system procurement or lifecycle costs. Comments received by April 15, 2005 will be considered by the Government for basis of modification to the specification documents.  Comments will not be directly responded to but may be addressed collectively at a future date during or prior to solicitation.  The specification documents and a feedback mechanism are available on the NFELC website at http://www.navfac.navy.mil >Organization >Specialty Centers >Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC) >Showcase >Medium Tactical Vehicle Repl. This request for comments is information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE – NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS – It is the policy of the US Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the US Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.   Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that US Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns the interested party is encouraged to contact the US Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in wiring, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protest fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (CG-85), 2100 2nd street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593.

<DESC>Requirements Office Address Project Manager Ground Combat Command and Control (GC C2),  Building 2525, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703 This notice is to survey the marketplace to identify potential sources, in addition to the current contractor, for the follow on contract for the continued development of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS-A) and sustainment of the Maneuver Contro l System (MCS) 6.3 Unix based platform and integration, test and training of the Army Injectors into the Joint Tactical Common Operational picture Workstation (JTCW).  The proposed effort has a period of performance  1 Oct 05- 30 Sep 07.  A brief synopsis of the proposed effort is provided below. This notice is to determine if there are contractors qualified to compete for this effort recognizing the product specific expertise, domain experience, and time constraints required to successfully accomplish the specified tasks.  Interested contractors should submit information concerning their qualifications and ability to complete the required work to either Ms. Kathleen Maxwell (kathleen.maxwell@mail1.monmouth.army.mil or Ms Barbara Girgus (barbara.girgus@mail1 .monmouth.army.mil.) Task 1: MCS is an automated tactical Command, Control and Communications (C3) system that provides a network of computer terminals to process combat information for commanders and their battle staffs.  It provides automated assistance in the collection, storage, r eview, and display of information to support the commanders decision process.  Both text and graphics are provided to the user.  It enables operation staffs (G3/S3) to process and distribute situational awareness, estimates, plans, orders and reports.  Th e system is designed to operate with existing and planned communication networks.  It is an essential component of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and provides critical coordination among Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) within each echelon.  MCS provides the Common Operational Picture (COP) software supporting the battlefield situation display for all Command Posts from Corps to Battalion echelons.  The COP depicts information provided by all the BFAs to MCS for integration and display and include s a Situation Map, an integrated Blue Picture consisting of platform and unit position reports from all other BFAs, a Red Picture provided from ASAS and from enemy observation reports submitted by other BFAs and soldiers on the battlefield, a set of graphi cal control measures depicting the units scheme of maneuver and concept of operations, Intelligence and Electronic Warfare graphics, Fire Support Control Measures and targets graphics, combat service support location information and graphics, air corridor s and air defense weapons control information.  MCS also provides Army Combat Engineering capabilities via the integration of MCS-Engineer software and provides Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) planning, reporting, warning, analysis, and prediction c apabilities via the integration of the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) software. There are 3 MCS software baselines - MCS 6.3.6, MCS 6.3 Delta, and MCS 6.4.  The   MCS 6.3.6 and 6.3Delta versions have been used in support of OEF/OIF.  MCS 6.3.6 (Unix and Windows solution) is issued to 1CAV, III Corps HQ, and SBCT 1, 2, and 3.  MCS 6.3 Delta (Windows solution) has been issued to the remaining Army units.  MCS 6.4 is in the final stages of development and test and will be deployed in 1st Qtr. 06 in support of OEF/OIF The task that will need to be accomplished, by either the existing contractor or another source established via the market survey process, is the continued maintenance of the  MCS Version 6.3.6 Unix-based product in support of all its current fieldings. The contractor tasked to accomplish this effort would have to have detailed knowledge and experience with the code in order to sustain it through security and safety updates, Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) I nfrastructure updates, interface/database updates from other systems that interoperate with MCS, and continued troubleshooting support in the field both CONUS and OCONUS.  The MCS 6.3.6 Unix-based system code is written in Java, C++, C, and Unix Scripting Language. Task 2: The Joint Tactical COP Workstation (JTCW) represents the convergence of Army and Marine products into a single joint workstation to meet the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps ground tactical command and control requirements in accordance with JROCM 161-03. T he Army is in the process of adding current capabilities found in their MCS and GCCS-A products onto this single joint workstation platform in the form of injectors/applications needed to satisfy the Army requirements.  The initial Army functionality built  on the JTCW 7.0 infrastructure is scheduled for a Sept 05 delivery to SPAWAR to continue its development through an integration and IV&V phase and then to an operational evaluation in FY06 with and early FY07 fielding decision.  JTCW 7.1 is scheduled to b e delivered in 3rd Qtr 06.  This delivery will be targeted to incorporate updates to meet requirements for the DoD network-centric key performance parameters, Army Software Blocking requirement upgrades, and enhanced functionality for Joint interoperabilit y.  Army Software Blocking activities and initiatives may drive additional deliveries(s). The effort that is planned for the current Army JTCW contractor or other source established via the market survey process, would be the continuation of the overall coordination of all aspects of JTCW Systems and Software Engineering and full responsibility  for Army injector integration, test, configuration management, quality assurance, delivery, logistics, training, and risk management to ensure the JTCW satisfies Army requirements and Army injectors are properly designed, interfaced, and  are interoperabl e. This effort is for the JTCW 7.1 delivery and any further deliveries prior to the Sept 07 timeframe.   In addition, the contractor will be responsible for continued development and sustainment of the Near Real Time Server (NRTS) /Publish and Subscribe Server (PASS) Data Provider and the Multinational Interoperability Programme (MIP) injector for the JTCW to  include: ·	Problem Report resolution ·	Foundation product upgrades  ·	ABCS updates and modifications as required for NATO interoperability  ·	Enhancements to the configuration GUI, Server console and persistent storage for improved system configuration  ·	Modifications as required for Joint and NATO interfaces in the data model, schema and mappings ·	Demonstration team to support exercises, test events and demonstrations of the MIP  Understanding of the code base, Domain Business Rules, and data flow for the NRTS/PASS are essential for continued development and sustainment of ABCS interfaces.  Understanding of the code base, Domain Business Rules, and Data Model and interoperability i n the NATO environment are essential for continued development and sustainment of the MIP. Task 3  The Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A) is a service specific implementation of the DoDs Joint Global Command and Control System (GCCS-J).  GCCS-A is the Armys strategic and theater Command and Control (C2) system and serves as the bridge bet ween the Joint community and the Army Battle Command System (ABCS).  Built on  the Common Operating Environment (COE) foundation, GCCS-A provides many client/server applications that are used to support critical C2 functions, including force readiness, for ce planning, force projection, and situational awareness. Product Manager (PdM) GCCS-A, part of the PM GCC2 organization,  needs to ensure support of the GCCS-As development and deployment of critical functionality that is tightly coupled to the Global Command and Control System  Joint (GCCS-J).  The upcoming v ersion of GCCS-J 4.0 will require updates to GCCS-A, the Armys extension of GCCS -J.  During this period, PdM GCCS-A will synchronize the development and fielding of the GCCS-A Block 4 with GCCS-J Block V .  In order to support the PdMs requirements, the contractor will need to provide engineering and technical support services to inc lude system engineering, design, software development, hardware integration, testing, training, field support, program support, system accreditation activities, segmentation support, and on-site support to the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) at F t Hood, TX. Two software baselines, Operational and Strategic, are currently under development. The code contains approximately 43 Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCI) with a line of code count of about 6.7 Million, not including the Commercial Off-the-Shelf S oftware and Government Off-the-Shelf Software (COTS/GOTS).  The code is written in a variety of languages that include, but are not limited to, Ada, C++, COBOL, Powerbuilder, and Java.  Software Development Folders (SDF) are available in various forms but have not been audited for the final delivery. A high level schedule for the period of performance (October 05 thru September 07) is outlined below. All feature lists associated with a release/delivery are notional; the release/delivery will include but not be limited to those functions listed.   Durin g this period GCCS-A will be positioning the baseline for transition to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based on web services technologies to include JOPES, SORTS, WebCOP, and WEEMC.  This two year period will involve architecture changes to GCCS-A i n order to combine the current operational and strategic baselines into one fieldable baseline with selectable capabilities based on echelon.  The major releases during this period will be 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 which support the corresponding GCCS-J Block V re leases.   It should be noted that the breakout of the joint capabilities by release within Block V have not been published.   The GCCS-J Block V capabilities/functions that GCCS-A will build upon for 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 are:  ·	Improved security posture "	Posture security infrastructure to utilize NCES services as they become available  "	Authentication (single sign-on), Authorization (role based access control), and Confidentiality (encryption),  "	Auditing and logging ·	Implement netcentric technologies "	Migrate from client/server to a common N-Tier/ Service Oriented Architecture infrastructure "	Begin implementation of many-to-many vs. point-to-point data exchanges using web services technologies "	Begin transformation from self-contained mission applications to C2 services that can be combined to create JC2 Mission Capability Packages Command and Control functionality  "	Implement single architecture and enterprise-class infrastructure  "	Implement NCES-ready, standards-based, services-oriented architecture "	Provide scalable to support more users per server enclave  "	Provide integrated, but application independent, run-time common services: 	Web and J2EE application servers 	Load balancing and redundancy 	Single administration console 	Expanded use of thin client and rich client technologies in which client functionality is delivered vs. installed 	Small client administration burden 	Reduced COE footprint  The  development cycle will run 12 months for each of the GCCS-J Block V releases (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3).    GCCS-A must implement its supporting releases within 30 days of GCCS-J. GCCS-A B4.1 delivery projected for 3QFY06 will implement an enhanced Common Operational Picture (COP). GCCS-A will also integrate and implement the Web Enabled Mission Management Capability  (WEEMC) and WebCOP.  WebCOP will be a complement to the existing C2PC as a Situational Awareness tool. Additionally COP injectors, as provided by GCCS-J, will be implemented for Army use.  This release will build on the existing GCCS-A 4.0a and 4.0b releases to create a single GCCS-A baseline that can  be fielded to all echelons.  Of particular note, all new software and hardware must be IPV6 compliant and as existing software is opened for enhancements or fixes, it too must be made IPV6 compliant.  It is anticipated that this release will require int egration of the JOPES Data Exchange (DEX) implementation along with the common Oracle database for GCCS-A (whether developed by Lockheed Martin or another contractor).  Each release will also contain necessary COTS and security upgrades to meet technology insertion and IAVA requirements, respectively. GCCS-A B4.2 delivery is projected for release in 3QFY07.   New or enhanced functionality planned for GCCS-J v4.2 will be built upon for the Army implementation.  This may include:  Initial n-tier capability w/PKI certificates and publish/subscribe capabili ty, 3-D representation of intelligence and imagery data, and Joint STARS.   This block must ensure supportable hardware/software end of life cycle issues are addressed.  GCCS-A will continue transition to SOA and NCES architectural requirements and the web -enablement of additional application process.  This release will also contain necessary COTS and security upgrades to meet technology insertion and IAVA requirements, respectively. GCCS-A B4.3 delivery is projected for 3QFY08.  Currently it is anticipated that the functionality enhancements would include: Joint Network Management System (JNMS), Joint Engineering Planning and Execution System (JEPES), Weapons of Mass Destruction Medic al Analysis Tool (WMD MAT), COP - universal interface standard, and Alternative Courses of Action (ACOA), and theater wide LAN, upgrade mission applications and interfaces.   Each release will also contain necessary COTS and security upgrades to meet techn ology insertion and IAVA requirements, respectively.  In addition to the requirements specified above the contractor will also be responsible for the following:  ·	The developer will also be in charge of performing V&V on all user/software documentation and training materials for each release.   ·	Developing quarterly patches containing bug fixes, upgrades in support of on-going OEF/OIF activities/deployments, and IAVA update requirements.   ·	Support of test reviews, verification testing at Joint and Army levels, Milestone decisions, Joint Family of System (FoS) activities, and documentation requirements.

<SUBJECT>B--PLAN FOR PRIORITIZING TEACHER TRAINING, INTEGRATING EXISTING MATH, SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION INITIATIVES; AND EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR CREATING A "VIRTUAL" SPACE ACADEMY
<DESC>Request for Information on Commission Recommendation 8-1 The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The report can be viewed electronically at  http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf	.  In recommendation 8 - 1, the Commission recommends that the federal government work with America’s education community and state and local political leaders to produce an action plan that leverages the Vision for Space Exploration in support of the nation’s commitment to improve math, science, and engineering education. To do so, that plan should:  -- increase the priority of teacher training;  -- provide for better integration of existing math, science, and engineering education initiatives across governments, industries, and professional organizations; and,  -- explore options to create a university-based “virtual space academy” for training the next generation technical work force.  The Commission wrote that the challenge before us is to leverage the journey to the space frontier to engage learners of all ages and interests. The commission said that NASA should enlist the cooperation of the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation to maximize the impact of space-related programs in education. Collectively these organizations, working with state and local political leaders, can establish a more aggressive approach for encouraging youth to enter math, science, and engineering professions, according to the Commission’s findings.  The Commission believes that expanded formal K-12 education efforts by industry, universities, and professional associations are needed, and that NASA should strive to integrate its educational efforts with those of these other interested stakeholders. In order for the vision to be as inclusive as possible, education programs need to target and recruit under-represented populations in the fields of math, science, and engineering.  In addition, the Commission cited the insufficient methods for students to acquire hands-on experience in the scientific and technical disciplines necessary for space commerce and exploration. They called for an alliance between NASA and universities to create a “virtual” space academy, the goals of which would be: 1) to provide tangible experiences that prepare students for a future in a space-related field, and 2) to bridge the divide between engineering and science training. The academy would be funded by NASA, but would take advantage of the programs and practices already in place in America’s universities.  NASA is very interested in receiving thoughtful comments and ideas from all sources regarding this recommendation of the Commission. Upon receiving these responses, NASA will share the information received with the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation.  NASA is also seeking ideas on establishing an institute for the study of space exploration policy. This institute would collect a number of interdisciplinary skills from science, engineering, public management and public policy, among others. This new entity would be a resource that could synergistically apply its various expertise to significant  space policy matters. Responses to this call for comments and ideas may lead to a decision to compete study contracts, feasibility studies or other follow-on work to implement this recommendation.  Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than September 1, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to chouston@mail.hq.nasa.gov. Responses to this RFI should be sent to Dr. Clifford Houston at the address shown below. Responses are due September 20, 2004. Respondents shall provide an electronic submission to the email address given above in addition to the hard copy submission to the address below. Responses are limited to 20 pages. An executive summary shall be included as a part of your 20 page response.  Responses may be sent to:  Dr. Clifford W. Houston  Deputy Associate Administrator for Education  Office of Education  NASA Headquarters  300 E Street S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20546  This document is for information and planning purposes. This document is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results.

FOB Destination shall be Sterling, VA 20164 <BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, EXACT MATCH ONLY, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, DETECTION KIT FOR DETECTION OF CHEMICAL WARFARE AGENTS The M256 consists of a carrying case, a booklet of M8 paper, 12 disposable  sampler-detectors individually  sealed in a plastic laminated foil envelop, and a set of instruction cards  attached by a lanyard to the plastic  carrying case. The case is made from molded, high impact plastic and has a  nylon carrying strap and a  nylon belt attachment. The case measures seven inches high, five inches  wide, and three inches in depth.  The entire kit weighs 1.2 pounds. The kit can operate in temperatures  ranging from minus 25 degrees  Fahrenheit (-32 degrees Celsius) to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees  Celsius).  The M8 paper is used to test liquid substances for the presence of nerve  agents and blister agents. It is  similar to the litmus (pH) paper that is found in almost any laboratory in  that a test result is indicated in  both types of paper by a change in color. The difference is that M8 paper is  specifically designed (dyeimpregnated)  to react to nerve agents and blister agents in liquid form The M8 paper  comes in 4&quot; x 2.5&quot;  booklets, each containing 25 sheets of detector paper.  Each sampler-detector contains a square impregnated spot for blister agents,  a circular test spot for blood  agents, a star test spot for nerve agents, and a lewisite detecting tablet  and rubbing tab. The test spots are  made of standard laboratory filter paper. There are eight glass ampoules,  six containing reagents for testing  and two in an attached chemical heater. When the ampoules are crushed  between the fingers, formed  channels in the plastic sheets direct the flow of liquid reagent to wet the  test spots. Each test spot or  detecting tablet develops a distinctive color which indicates whether a  chemical agent is or is not present in  the air. Any type of mustard is also detectable as long as vapor is present.  Agent Detected: Symbol: Class:  Hydrogen Cyanide AC &quot;Blood&quot; (cyanide)  Cyanogen Chloride CK &quot;Blood&quot; (cyanide)  Mustard H Blister  Nitrogen Mustard HN Blister  Distilled Mustard HD Blister  Phosgene Oxime CX Blister  Lewsite L Blister  Nerve Agents V and G series Nerve, 350, KT; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Department of State intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

<DESC>Title:  LIGHT DUTY STEEL POLE STRUCTURES Western Area Power Administration requires a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract for Light Duty Transmission Line Steel Pole Structures (Class 2 Equivalent), for its Corporate Service Office (CSO) located in Lakewood, Colorado; the Rocky Mountain Customer Service Office (RMR) located in Loveland, Colorado; The Upper Great Plains Customer Service Office (UGP) with the office located in Huron, South Dakota; and the Desert Southwest Customer Service Office (DSR) located in Phoenix, Arizona.  Delivery of poles may be to the following states:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. Contract will be awarded for a five year period.  The Government intends to utilize the procedures in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) to award using a best value determination procedure. Estimated contract value is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000. Estimated award date is on or about May 1, 2005. Individual delivery orders will be issued against the contract. The acquisition is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code is 331221 and the size standard is 1000 employees. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The full solicitation is attached to this announcement. Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the following process and criteria: (1) AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerorâ€™s best terms from a price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. (2) BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD (a) Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT): This acquisition will utilize the PPT technique to make a best value award decision.  Past Performance is equal to price.  Price and past performance may be traded off, one against the other, as addressed in paragraph (ii) below. The application of the PPT technique in contract award and selection and approval process is as follows: (i) All offerors will receive a performance risk assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence, or No Confidence. (ii)  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest evaluated price offeror or to a higher priced offeror with a better performance risk rating.  The Contracting Officer shall make an assessment of the price proposed and the performance risk rating assigned to determine the best value for the Government. (b)  Past Performance Risk Assessment: (i) Performance risk will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance risk is assessed based on recency, relevancy and quality of performance.  A relevance determination is made based upon whether an offerorâ€™s performance is relevant to this acquisition in terms of work, size and complexity.  Past Performance information is not limited to just that of the offeror.  It may also include predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirements.  In assessing performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: (a) reviewing the experience listed in the proposal, (b) evaluating the offerorsâ€™ success in meeting small business subcontracting goals, (c) seeking additional present and past performance information through the use of simplified questionnaires, and (d) using data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. (ii) The purpose will be to identify and review the recency, relevancy and quality of the offerorâ€™s work present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the offerorâ€™s ability to perform this effort. The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating as defined below.  This risk assessment represents the evaluation teamâ€™s analysis of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the itâ€™s demonstrated present and past performance. Rating       Definition Exceptional/High Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Very Good/Significant Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory/Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral/Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable. Marginal/Little Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Changes to the offerorâ€™s existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. Unsatisfactory/No Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (c)  The following documents will be evaluated for responsiveness, completeness and compliance with requirements of the RFP.  Incomplete items may be a basis for rejection. â€¢ A signed copy of the solicitation contract award document, SF 1449. â€¢ Completed bid schedule, Section B. â€¢ Acknowledgment of all amendments, SF 30(s). â€¢ Completed Representation and Certifications, FAR 52.212-3. â€¢ Applicable fill in provisions completed â€¢ Past Performance Questionnaires and applicable attachments, FAR 52.212-2 (d) Pre-Award Survey of Prospective Contractors: If your response to this solicitation is favorably considered, a survey team may contact your facility to determine your ability to perform.  Current financial statements and other pertinent data should be available for Government review at that time if not already on file with the office having cognizance over your facility. Examples of these areas that may be investigated and evaluated are listed below: (1) Technical Capability (2) Production Capability (3) Plant Facilities and Equipment (4) Financial Responsibility (5) Purchases and Subcontracting (6) Accounting Systems (7) Quality Assurance (8) Transportation (9) Plant Security (10)  Security Clearance (11)  Labor Resources (12)  Performance Record (13)  Ability to Meet Delivery Schedules (14)  Other as Appropriate Offerors are advised that accomplishment of this survey is a part of the evaluation process and is not to be construed as an indication that an Offeror will receive or is in the best position to receive the award. PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance shall provide adequate information describing the offerorâ€™s previous experience in manufacturing and providing light duty steel structures, or work of a similar complexity and magnitude, both commercial and government that are ongoing or were completed in the last three years.  The offeror shall also list all contracts having a similar complexity and magnitude (maximum of last ten consecutive contracts) performed within the past three years.  If the offeror has not performed ten contracts within the past three years having the same complexity or magnitude as required for this solicitation then please list whatever contracts performed (maximum of ten contracts).  In addition, past performance information on contracts not listed by the offeror may be solicited by the Government.  If an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the proposal is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offerorâ€™s key personnel have worked.  The offeror should provide all information regarding the past performance efforts applicable to predecessor companies.  If the offeror claims there is no past performance, then that status must be identified to the Contracting Officer no later than the date and time due for past performance proposals from all offerors. (1)  Provide a summary of the previous contracts described above.  Include information on subcontractors whose effort on this acquisition is projected to be more than 25% of the effort.  The summary must include: (a) Name of project (contract number, if applicable) (b) Name and address of customer or government agency (c) Name and telephone number of customer contact or contracting officer (d) Dollar value and period of performance (e) Description of work performed (2) Provide statements, letters, reports, or evaluations from prior customers indicating the level and quality of past performance on the above contracts. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS (1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals - The following steps will occur as part of the initial evaluation: (a) Offer and Other Documents Reviewed: All documents will be evaluated to ensure compliance with the solicitation requirements and the offeror's eligibility for award. Award will only be made to a responsive, responsible firm.  Questions relating to eligibility due to partnerships, teaming arrangements, joint ventures, etc., will be referred to the Legal Advisor or Small Business Administration representative as appropriate. (b) Past Performance Initial Assessment: The ten (10) references provided by each offeror will be reviewed to identify those most representative of the requirements.  Five (5) additional references will be required for any major subcontractors, partners, or joint venture participants.  All references will be assessed as "highly" representative, "moderately" representative or "barely" representative. (c) Pricing Data Calculated: Price proposals will be evaluated to determine the accuracy and reasonableness of the proposed price and the calculated price to the Government.  Price proposals will be compared to the Government's cost estimate as one measure of reasonableness. (d) Technical Compliance: Each offer will be reviewed to ensure that all elements of the specifications have been addressed. (e) Initial Recommendation and Decision: The results of the initial evaluation will be recorded and presented to the Contracting Officer for a source selection decision. Offerors not selected will be notified of the reason for their exclusion. .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N00019-05-C-0291 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-25 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Change Notice (DCN) 20041110. This action is not set aside for a small business. The applicable NAICS is 334419 and the small business size standard is <500 employees. This is a DO rated order with an assigned rating of A70. This requirement is being procured sole source through Honeywell Defense and Space Electronic Systems, Albuquerque, NM. Required delivery date: within 45 days of date of award. The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters (NAVAIR HQ), Patuxent River MD has a requirement to protect the production and repair capability of the Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D), the mission system for the F/A-18 and AV-8B aircrafts. A commercial part component of the Advanced Mission Computer (AMC) Image Processor Module (IPM), as well as the Advanced Multi Purpose Display (AMPD), a Fiber Channel Transceiver (Manufactured by Vitesse, Part No. VSC7126QX) is to become obsolete. The requirement to protect F/A-18E/F Lots 29-35 production and repair support necessitates the procurement of approximately 4,209 each Transceivers. There are no other known parts that meet form, fit, function replacement requirements.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. Honeywell is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AMC IPM and the AMPD, as well as the designated repair facility, and as such is the only source capable of procuring these parts to protect forward-fit production and repair. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price type purchase order will be awarded. All hardware items will ship-in-place at the contractor’s facility; FOB Origin with Inspection and Acceptance at Origin applies.  Inspection and Acceptance of the supplies and services to be furnished hereunder shall be performed at the supplier’s plant, Albuquerque, NM by the cognizant Administrative Contracting officer (ACO) or their duly authorized representative.  The contract line item number and description is: CLIN 0001 Fibre Channel Transceiver, p/n Vitesse VSC7126QX; 4,209 each; period of performance: 45 days after contract award. The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under any “Inspection” clause that may be in the contract, nor does it limit the Government’s right s with regard to the other terms and conditions of this purchase order.   In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.   The Statement of Work for this effort is provided as an attachment to this synopsis/solicitation.  Award is expected to be on or before 31 December 2004. The supplies to be furnished hereunder shall be preserved, packaged and packed in accordance with best commercial practices to assure safe delivery at destination.  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2004) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition, except that there is an addendum to paragraph (h) in that this will be a single award.

The KHILS facility provides a realistic ground-test environment for quantifying the performance of precision-guided interceptors for strategic and theater missile defense.  The objective of the existing KVACC system is to provide a complete cryogenic optical system, a complex infrared target projection system, and a surrogate sensor subsystem that meets the required optical, radiometric, and environmental conditions for hardware-in-the-loop testing of Kinetic Kill Vehicles (KKV's) requiring exo-atmospheric temperature and altitude conditions.  The CIRS provides the surrogate sensor system and provides characterization of the emitter technologies.  CIRS is an all- reflective optical system with independent cooling circuits for the optics and the FPA.  The camera is surrounded with cold shielding and thermally insulated from the KVACC chamber to eliminate stray radiation.  The optics are cooled to 77 K and the focal plane array is cooled to 45 K.  CIRS uses an SE-IR CamIRa tm for operating the FPA electronics. The camera head is mounted on the outside of the KVACC sensor chamber.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The purpose of this contractual effort is to capture ambient interferometer performance data prior to disassembly and repair.  Remove the mirrors, which are pinned to a common housing allowing easy removal and replacement.  Realignment may be required.  Then clean the optical housing, prepare for painting, paint, and cure the paint.  Then prepare the housing for reassembly and operation in a cryovacuum environment.  Reassemble the mirrors to the housing.  Obtain ambient interferometer performance data and align the mirrors to achieve performance equal to or better than the performance data collected at the beginning of the repair process if required.  As a separately priced option, cryogenic interferometer performance data collection at the completion and prior to shipping to KHILS shall be included in the quote.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  Technical papers that may be reviewed to provide additional background information are:  Mechanical Drawings, Acceptance Test Data, and Design Review Presentations.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  The following list of equipment shall be provided:  CIRS camera with the FPA, FPA clamp, filters and focus stage removed. (Housing and mirrors only); FPA retro ball fixture for interferometer testing.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  This program shall include the interferometer performance characterization, mirror removal and refurbishment of the CIRS housing, reassembly, alignment, and post interferometer performance data:  Acceptance Test Interferometer Data (prior to disassembly measure ambient baseline wave front error (WFE) at HeNe laser wavelength (could require a government decision if WFE exceeds 0.45 at this point based on current performance of WFE < 0.45)), Pre-refurbishment characterization, Refurbishment (remove old paint, surface preparation, paint using flat black Aeroglaze Z306), Assembly, post interferometer data and alignment (measure ambient WFE at HeNe laser wavelength (WFE <0.45), priced option:  measure cryogenic WFE at HeNe laser wavelength (WFE < 0.54).  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Contractors must also provide with their quotations the following:  Technical:  (1) procedures for surface preparation, application, and bake out of Z306 flat black paint on aluminum surfaces and, (2) procedures for verifying optical alignment of CIRS collimating optics after repainting and reassembly.  Experience/Past Performance that demonstrates:  (1) the design, fabrication and testing of cryogenic rated optical systems including optical alignment and evaluation of optical performance at ambient and cryogenic; (2) the application of Z306 paint on aluminum surfaces cryogenic rated optical systems; (3) in-house capabilities (including the experienced personnel and equipment) required to repaint, realign and to re-qualify the optical performance of the CIRS collimating optics at ambient and cryogenic conditions.  Completion of this effort shall take place no later than 16 weeks after receipt of order on an FOB Destination basis.

6.		 Project Descriptions and Profile

	During USTDA’s last business development trip to Jordan in December 2004, they met with officials from the Jordanian Ministry of Energy (MOE) to discuss potential USTDA support for a number of energy projects.  The MOE has recently released its Twenty Year Master Plan for Jordan’s Energy Sector (Master Plan).  The MOE has requested USTDA funding assistance for projects related to their Master Plan including upgrading refinery infrastructure, crude supply pipelines and port infrastructure, gas distribution networks, new transmission assets, and improved energy supply infrastructure

	Jordan has almost no indigenous energy resources and energy imports account for nearly 10% of GDP.  Due to economic growth and increasing population energy demand is expected to increase by at least 50% over the next 20 years, and therefore the provision of reliable energy supply at reasonable cost is a crucial element of economic reform.  Over the last decade, the energy sector of Jordan has undergone significant transformation, and in the near to medium term the sector faces several additional challenges:
·	The concession agreement for Jordan’s only refinery, the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JoPetrol) will expire in 2008.
·	Commercial gas imports from Egypt will have a substantial impact on the primary energy supply to Jordan. 
·	The move to gas and changes in historic subsidized supplies of crude from Iraq will have a substantial impact on the refinery. 
·	Current energy pricing regimes do not reflect international market prices, and numerous, complex subsidies exist. 

	In addition, demand growth requires a number of policy initiatives increased emphasis on energy efficiency; diversification of energy supplies to reduce risk; development of improved energy supply infrastructure; development of the gas industry and increased use of indigenous energy resources. 

	In response to these challenges, the Government of Jordan (GOJ), has developed an integrated and comprehensive Energy Master Plan for the development of the energy sector over the next 20 years. The Master Plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in December 2004 and requires investment of over $3 billion over the next 20 years.  Implementation of the plan is expected to yield a net increase in GDP of $250 million per year for the Jordanian economy.  The GOJ also anticipates that the projects proposed in the Master Plan will create a number of investment opportunities, which will be structured to encourage and promote private sector participation.

	The opportunities arising from the Master Plan that could lead to potential USTDA funding activities are described below.

Upgrading Refinery Infrastructure 

	Jordan has no significant oil resource of its own, and must rely on imported oil for all of its needs.  Demand for refined products in Jordan is expected grow, particularly for diesel and gasoline, while demand for fuel oil will decline as this is displaced by gas in the power sector. JoPetrol has a monopoly on most of the value chain including importing products, refining, logistics and customer supply.  However the concession awarding this monopoly will expire in 2008 and the refined products sector will be extensively reformed.  To meet the requirements for the changing product mix, JoPetrol would like to upgrade the refinery to produce lighter products and improve product specification.  JoPetrol expects to open a $600 million upgrade and expansion tender.  This project represents a large opportunity for U.S. engineering services firms and U.S. suppliers of refinery equipment and services.   

Crude Supply Pipelines and Port Infrastructure

	Currently, crude is supplied to Jordan via the Port of Aqaba and then transported by road to intended recipients.  This method is both expensive and inefficient.  The GOJ is considering alternatives such as a crude supply pipeline from Iraq, refurbishment of the tap-line from Saudi Arabia, construction of a crude oil pipeline from Aqaba Port, and refurbishment of the rail system in Jordan.  In addition, the GOJ is interested in the refurbishment of crude and product handling and storage facilities at Aqaba Port and other key locations throughout Jordan. 

Gas Distribution Networks

	The GOJ would like to encourage further development of the gas sector and gas distribution networks within Jordan in order to supply smaller customers.  The Arab Gas Pipeline has been successfully delivering gas to Aqaba Thermal Power Station since July 2003. Expansion of the pipeline to the north of Jordan to supply power to industrial customers will be complete by the end of 2005.

New Transmission Assets

	Over the last five years, Jordan’s electricity sector has undergone significant reform and is currently being privatized.  Jordan’s long-term electricity demand is expected to grow by 5% per year for the next ten years.  The initial phase of introducing Egyptian natural gas began in 2003, and will introduce new opportunities in modernizing and transforming Jordan’s antiquated power stations to operate on gas.  The MOE plans to establish 2100MW of new gas fired generating capacity to meet growing energy demands and replace old generating assets.  In addition, the GOJ in interested in investing in transmission assets.
