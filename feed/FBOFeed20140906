Specifically, a small business sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps referencing the above detailed generic requirements and no responses were received.  Additionally, knowledgeable inviduals in the Government and Industry were contacted for market research purposes.  None of the subject matter experts contacted were able to identify any contractor other than Lafayette Instrument which could meet the needs of this requirement.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the DePuy Synthes Trauma ProDisc Total Disc Replacement System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113- Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is DePuy Synthes Trauma, 1302 Wrights Ln. E., West Chester, PA 19380. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm EST, Monday, 8 Sep 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the DePuy Synthes Trauma ProDisc Total Disc Replacement System for an upcoming surgery. Currently this is the only system that has FDA approval and that the surgical staff is properly trained on. These factors have made the DePuy Synthes Trauma ProDisc Total Disc Replacement System the only viable option for this surgical procedure. <br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at <a href="https://www.sam.gov">https://www.sam.gov</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br />Any information should be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:david.mcclannan@us.af.mil">david.mcclannan@us.af.mil</a> no later than1:00 pm EST, Monday, 8 Sep 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered. <br /><br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "DePuy Synthes Trauma TDR". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.<br />

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

52.216-2  ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT-STANDARD SUPPLIES (JAN 1997)
  (a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for  is not in excess of the Contractor's applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term "unit price" excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice.  The term "established price" means a price that-
    (1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and
    (2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.
  (b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.
  (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price.
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective-
      (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or
      (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
    (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.
    (5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.
  (d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

<SUBJECT>Gallup Daily Tracking Survey Data
<SOLNBR>14-233-SOL-00764
<RESPDATE>091614
<CONTACT>James J. Horkan, Phone 3014431658, Email james.horkan@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).
<p><br />Notice of Intent:<br />The Program Support Center on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) within the Department of Health and Human Services intends on soliciting from Gallup, Inc. pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source, because Gallup is the only source that can supply license agreements to the data needed to satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Gallup is the sole developer and distributor of a daily polling of Americans on health measures. The sample is also sufficiently large to be representative of all states. This representation is required to analyze issues related to the implementation of health reforms at a geographic level, including estimates of people that might be eligible/enroll in the various health coverage alternatives available to them based on their demographics. It is unique in that it is a nationally representative sample of Americans questioned over a long period of time with a core set of questions that can measure change over time. Another specific benefit of the Gallup data is that it is available so much sooner than other sources of estimates of health coverage of the population. For these reasons, Gallup has been determined to be the only technically acceptable vendor that is capable of providing this specialized data at the level of quality required.</p>
<p>Description:<br />This requirement is to purchase daily updates of the Gallup Daily tracking survey data with additional state weighting. In addition to daily updates, ASPE will receive all micro data from January 2008 to present day. This data set will include data from both the Gallup Healthways-Well-being Index Survey and the Political and Economic Survey. The anticipated contract period will be for 12 months.</p>
<p>Provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with offer.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify in writing their interest and capability to respond. Capability statements shall be submitted via email to James Horkan at james.horkan@psc.hhs.gov. Responses are due by September 16, 2014 by 10:00 am (EST). Responses will not be accepted after the due date.</p>
<p>II. HHS SECTION 508 ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS NOTICE (SEPTEMBER 2009)</p>
<p>This contract is subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the Act) of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Electronic and Information Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR Part 1194).

<DESC>***The Pre-proposal Conference/Site Visit for the O&amp;M solicitation/Seed Project will be held in Building XBG3A Regimental Room on Wednesday September 10, 2014 at 9:00am at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Please contact Shannon Hyatt at shannon.k.hyatt@usace.army.mil for further details. The solicitation will be issued on or about the 25th of August. *** <br /><br />The US Army Corps of Engineers is planning to advertise an Operation, Maintenance, and Incidental Repair and Minor Construction Contract to support the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Facilities Program. The request for proposal number is W91278-14-R-0005. The work consists of furnishing full service operation and maintenance of healthcare and medical research laboratory facilities in support of US Army Medical Command's (MEDCOM) Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization program. The Mobile Regional Contracting Center proposes to utilize a diverse mix of contractors via Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs). Potential contracts will have a nation-wide scope (continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and US possessions). The Operation, Maintenance, and Minor Construction contract is intended to provide operation and maintenance of medical facilities (healthcare and laboratory) in a continuous and satisfactory condition on a 24 hour basis, 7 days per week. Requirements include preventative, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance of all facility systems and components including architectural, mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation. Minor construction incidental to the O&amp;M mission may also be required. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of the functional operation relating to the efficient use of the facility, equipment, facility support systems, and building structures. Since the facilities will be in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the MTFs and will be required to implement infection control processes. Joint Commission Environment of Care requirements and other applicable requirements must be met, including maintenance of records of preventive maintenance on all critical systems and compliance with implementation of the facility's Utilities Management Plan. Total capacity over the potential four year life of the contract (base year plus three option years) shared amongst all contracts is $248,000,000. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be issued against the contracts. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally. Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process. Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 11 August 2014. The Contract Specialist for this project is Shannon Hyatt. Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email to CTC-Proposals-MEDCOM@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to these requirements is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. Medical facility operation and maintenance experience is required. Operation and Maintenance of a single building system (HVAC, electrical, etc.) is not considered indicative of experience in full service facility operation and maintenance. <br /><br />Note No. 1: All prospective contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers must be registered in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) before they will be allowed to download solicitation information. Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) prior to award of this contract. Solicitation documents will only be available via FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The response date for this synopsis is not the due date for proposals, the due date for proposals will be indicated in the forthcoming request for proposals.  <br>    <br>  The Government will use a Best Value Price Performance Tradeoff (PPT) Evaluation Process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.101-1.  The estimated Magnitude of Construction is between $25 Million and $100 Million.  The Solicitation will be used as Unrestricted under NAICS code 237990. There will be no options for this requirement. The Government contemplates that this solicitation will result in a single firm-fixed priced contract award.  <br>    <br>  Project Location: Savannah Harbor is located at Savannah on the northern coast of Georgia /southern coast of South Carolina in Chatham and Jasper Counties, respectively. The Savannah River is the line of demarcation separating Georgia from South Carolina. The existing Savannah Harbor entrance channel extends from Station 0+000 at the landward end of the navigation jetties offshore to Station -60+000B in the Atlantic Ocean. The deepened channel will extend an additional 37,680 feet offshore to Station -97+680B.   <br>    <br>  Project Description: The project includes removal of all material, including any material within the existing maintenance prism, to required project depths. All dredged material will be disposed of in the existing 5.6 square mile EPA-approved Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site(ODMDS) centered at 31  56' 54 quote mark  north and 80  45' 34 quote mark  west or in Jones Oysterbed (JOI) upland diked disposal area. Material between stations -10+000B and -11+500B and -49+500B and -60+000B shall only be placed in the Jones Oysterbed Island Confined Upland Disposal Area. The contractor has the option of placing the material between stations 0+000 and -10+000B and -11+500B and -24+000B in the Jones Oysterbed Island Confined Upland Disposal Area.    <br>    <br>  Stations 	Bin Yds with placement in upper 1/4 	Bin yds with placement in upper 1/2 	Placement Area   <br>  0+000 to -10+085 	13,500 	10,500 	ODMDS or JOI   <br>  -10+085 to -11+408 	JOI   <br>  -11+408 to -20+000 	13,500 	8,000 	ODMDS or JOI   <br>  -20+000 to -30+000 	13,500 	11,500 	ODMDS   <br>  -30+000 to -40+000 	13,500 	9,500 	ODMDS   <br>  -40+000 to -49+900 	13,500 	11,000 	ODMDS   <br>  -49+900 to -59+525 	JOI   <br>  -59+525 to -97+680 	13,500 	12,500 	ODMDS   <br>    <br>  Offshore conditions with a large tidal range should be anticipated in the areas to be dredged. Due to the presence of sea turtles in the project area hopper dredging will only be allowed between 1 December through 31 March. If dredging occurs during other times of year, an alternative method of excavation will be required. The material to be removed includes new work materials and overlying maintenance materials. The total volume to be removed is approximately 13.5 million cubic yards of new work and O&M material. Materials may vary substantially both vertically and horizontally. The areas to be dredged range from primarily sandy materials in the areas farthest offshore to finer grained materials from Station 0+000 to -30+000B. Between Station 0+000 and -30+000B layers of stiff Miocene clays will be encountered.  <br>    <br>  The project includes -2.0' of allowable pay overdepth between -49.0' and -51.0', however there is also -3.0' of allowable non-pay overdepth between -51.0' and -54.0'. Due to concerns regarding the confining layer of the Floridan Aquifer,.the Contractor shall not disturb any material below -54.0' (mllw) at any time during this project. This includes cutterheads, dragarms, clamshells, spuds, anchors or any other equipment deployed during this contract.  <br>    <br>  Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) has been encountered during previous dredging operations on the Savannah Harbor Entrance Channel and the Savannah Inner Harbor Channel. The Contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment or reimbursement for work stoppage of 24 hours or less from the time the CO directs the Contractor to stop. Each encounter shall be handled on a case by case basis. The following shall be the Standard Operating Procedure when UXO is encountered:  <br>    <br>  a. Cease all dredging operations and activities until further direction from the Contracting Officer  <br>  b. Contact Coast Guard MSU Savannah  <br>  c. Contact U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Quality Assurance Representative  <br>  d. Comply immediately with directions from the Coast Guard MSU Savannah  <br>  e. Do not handle or interact with the ordinance.  <br>  f. Once Navy Explosive Ordinace Disposal (EOD) arrives, comply with EOD instructions regarding the UXO.  <br>

The estimated Magnitude of Construction is between $25 Million and $100 Million.  The Solicitation will be used as Unrestricted under NAICS code 237990. There will be no options for this requirement. The Government contemplates that this solicitation will result in a single firm-fixed priced contract award.   <br>      <br>   Project Location: Savannah Harbor is located at Savannah on the northern coast of Georgia /southern coast of South Carolina in Chatham and Jasper Counties, respectively. The Savannah River is the line of demarcation separating Georgia from South Carolina. The existing Savannah Harbor entrance channel extends from Station 0+000 at the landward end of the navigation jetties offshore to Station -60+000B in the Atlantic Ocean. The deepened channel will extend an additional 37,680 feet offshore to Station -97+680B.    <br>      <br>   Project Description: The project includes removal of all material, including any material within the existing maintenance prism, to required project depths. All dredged material will be disposed of in the existing 5.6 square mile EPA-approved Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site(ODMDS) centered at 31  56' 54 quote mark  north and 80  45' 34 quote mark  west or in Jones Oysterbed (JOI) upland diked disposal area. Material between stations -10+000B and -11+500B and -49+500B and -60+000B shall only be placed in the Jones Oysterbed Island Confined Upland Disposal Area. The contractor has the option of placing the material between stations 0+000 and -10+000B and -11+500B and -24+000B in the Jones Oysterbed Island Confined Upland Disposal Area.     <br>      <br>   Stations 	Bin Yds with placement in upper 1/4 	Bin yds with placement in upper 1/2 	Placement Area    <br>   0+000 to -10+085 	13,500 	10,500 	ODMDS or JOI    <br>   -10+085 to -11+408 	JOI    <br>   -11+408 to -20+000 	13,500 	8,000 	ODMDS or JOI    <br>   -20+000 to -30+000 	13,500 	11,500 	ODMDS    <br>   -30+000 to -40+000 	13,500 	9,500 	ODMDS    <br>   -40+000 to -49+900 	13,500 	11,000 	ODMDS    <br>   -49+900 to -59+525 	JOI    <br>   -59+525 to -97+680 	13,500 	12,500 	ODMDS    <br>      <br>   Offshore conditions with a large tidal range should be anticipated in the areas to be dredged. Due to the presence of sea turtles in the project area hopper dredging will only be allowed between 1 December through 31 March. If dredging occurs during other times of year, an alternative method of excavation will be required. The material to be removed includes new work materials and overlying maintenance materials. The total volume to be removed is approximately 13.5 million cubic yards of new work and O&M material. Materials may vary substantially both vertically and horizontally. The areas to be dredged range from primarily sandy materials in the areas farthest offshore to finer grained materials from Station 0+000 to -30+000B. Between Station 0+000 and -30+000B layers of stiff Miocene clays will be encountered.   <br>      <br>   The project includes -2.0' of allowable pay overdepth between -49.0' and -51.0', however there is also -3.0' of allowable non-pay overdepth between -51.0' and -54.0'. Due to concerns regarding the confining layer of the Floridan Aquifer,.the Contractor shall not disturb any material below -54.0' (mllw) at any time during this project. This includes cutterheads, dragarms, clamshells, spuds, anchors or any other equipment deployed during this contract.   <br>      <br>   Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) has been encountered during previous dredging operations on the Savannah Harbor Entrance Channel and the Savannah Inner Harbor Channel. The Contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment or reimbursement for work stoppage of 24 hours or less from the time the CO directs the Contractor to stop. Each encounter shall be handled on a case by case basis. The following shall be the Standard Operating Procedure when UXO is encountered:   <br>      <br>   a. Cease all dredging operations and activities until further direction from the Contracting Officer   <br>   b. Contact Coast Guard MSU Savannah   <br>   c. Contact U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Quality Assurance Representative   <br>   d. Comply immediately with directions from the Coast Guard MSU Savannah   <br>   e. Do not handle or interact with the ordinance.   <br>   f. Once Navy Explosive Ordinace Disposal (EOD) arrives, comply with EOD instructions regarding the UXO.   <br>

109 South 13th Street Suite 3S, Philadelphia, PA 19107 US
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is awarding this procurement of commercial services as a firm fixed price contract small-business set aside (North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items), FAR 6.203 (Set-asides for small business concerns), and FAR Subpart 19.5 (Set-Asides for Small Business). This was a negotiated procurement, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 (Contract by Negotiations).
<p><br />Description:<br />The Department's mission is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation. The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) Office of Academic Improvement Teacher Quality (AITQ) is responsible for administering the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program, which is among the many grant programs that support the mission of the Department.</p>
<p>The 21st CCLC program is a State formula-grant program authorized under Title IV, Part B, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The No Child Left Behind Act converted the 21st CCLC program from discretionary grants made directly by the Department, to a program in which each State receives a grant based on its share of ESEA Title I, Part A funds. States must use their allocations to make competitive awards to eligible entities. The Secretary may reserve up to one percent of the total appropriation for the 21st CCLC program to carry out an array of national activities, including (but not limited to) national evaluations and the technical assistance activities described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The goal of the 21st CCLC program is to enable eligible entities serving high needs communities to plan, implement, or expand academic enrichment opportunities supporting out-of-school time and expanded learning time (ELT). The program helps students meet state and local student standards in core academic subjects, such as reading and math; offers students a broad array of enrichment activities that can complement their regular academic programs; and offers literacy and other educational services to the families of participating children.</p>
<p>Accurate and timely data collection is necessary to determine the needs and performance metrics of the 21st CCLC program. Further, reporting on program results to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The scope of the PWS encompasses contractor support services to perform the development, operations, sustainment, documentation, training, and enhancement of a cloud-based technology solution for the collection of information on the 21st CCLC program to assess annual and longitudinal progress at the national and state level.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract will be a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
