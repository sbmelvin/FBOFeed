These tasks are very important to the accuracy and effectiveness of Air Force peacetime and contingency supply requirements and levels.  RBL is an Air Force centralized supply leveling methodology used to minimize the number of unfilled supply requests at the base-level, throughout the Air Force.

Place of Performance will be Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex, Alabama, at the AFLMA.  Performance under this contract requires travel.  This will be a Labor hour contract with firm fixed priced labor rates.  The contract period of performance will include a twelve month base year beginning 1 Feb 08 and ending 31 Jan 09 and four consecutive twelve month options.  The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541519 and the size standard is $23 Mil.  The announcement will be available on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 5 Dec 2007.  Paper copies will not be available.  You may download the solicitation and submit your proposal as required in the solicitation.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.

All offerors responding to the solicitation must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which can be accomplished via the web at http://www.bpn.gov , Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) database at http://www.wawf.eb.mil, and Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, and supplemental information included in this notice.  Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Part 12 and 13.    This requirement utilized full and open competition, there are no set asides for small business.  For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.  This acquisition is determined to be subject to Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to Part 15 of the FAR regarding contracting by negotiation.  

In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices.  The 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA?s) in order to, on an as needed basis?s, acquire non-personal services for local telephone exchange services for smaller AF sites and AF recruiting offices in the state listed in subject title.  All orders placed against the BPA are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement and will be awarded as a Communication Service Authorization (CSA).   The current effort will result in multiple awards effective to begin during the entire period specified in this announcement (2013).  Each CSA order will generally have a five year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years as specified individually in each order.  All offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA ?Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA-Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) where services are being provided. Offers received from other than a certificated local exchange carrier with the State PUC where services are being provided will be deemed unacceptable and will not be considered.  Local communications service shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for commercial business lines, DSL or internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier. Please see below Statement of Work for details on the services requested.  Competition is open to domestic and foreign sources.  

 38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPA?s with qualified sources in order to competitively award BPA calls for local exchange services.  Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent.  The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any orders against the BPA.  The 38th EIG does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed $1 million.  There will be no limit to the number of orders issued under any of the prospective ordering agreements.  The government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations.  Only the 38 EIG will be able to issues orders against the established BPA?s.  A Past Performance/Price tradeoff process will be utilized in issuing orders under the BPA?s to obtain best value to the AF.  There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual orders against resulting BPA?s.   Proposal due date is to be open for the entire potential contract performance period stated in this announcement.  A respondent may at anytime attempt to become acceptable to 38 EIG/PKK requirements and submit a proposal by electronically requesting the BPA documentation from the POC?s e-mail listed in the announcement or by fax.  Phone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.

There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, and supplemental information included in this notice.  Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Part 12 and 13.    This requirement utilized full and open competition, there are no set asides for small business.  For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.  This acquisition is determined to be subject to Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to Part 15 of the FAR regarding contracting by negotiation.  

In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices.  The 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA?s) in order to, on an as needed basis?s, acquire non-personal services for local telephone exchange services for smaller AF sites and AF recruiting offices in the state listed in subject title.  All orders placed against the BPA are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement and will be awarded as a Communication Service Authorization (CSA).   The current effort will result in multiple awards effective to begin during the entire period specified in this announcement (2013).  Each CSA order will generally have a five year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years as specified individually in each order.  All offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA ?Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA-Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) where services are being provided. Offers received from other than a certificated local exchange carrier with the State PUC where services are being provided will be deemed unacceptable and will not be considered.  Local communications service shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for commercial business lines, DSL or internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier. Please see below Statement of Work for details on the services requested.  Competition is open to domestic and foreign sources.  

 38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPA?s with qualified sources in order to competitively award BPA calls for local exchange services.  Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent.  The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any orders against the BPA.  The 38th EIG does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed $1 million.  There will be no limit to the number of orders issued under any of the prospective ordering agreements.  The government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations.  Only the 38 EIG will be able to issues orders against the established BPA?s.  A Past Performance/Price tradeoff process will be utilized in issuing orders under the BPA?s to obtain best value to the AF.  There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual orders against resulting BPA?s.   Proposal due date is to be open for the entire potential contract performance period stated in this announcement.  A respondent may at anytime attempt to become acceptable to 38 EIG/PKK requirements and submit a proposal by electronically requesting the BPA documentation from the POC?s e-mail listed in the announcement or by fax.  Phone requests will not be accepted.

This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing weather and weather systems training, development of training materials and tools, continuing education systems support training, website development and maintenance, and installing upgrades to the Air Force Weather (AFW) standard information systems at Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS) located in the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and the Weather Schoolhouse (335 RSS/UOA) located on Keesler AFB, Mississippi.  Systems support includes the development and maintenance of websites essential to the dissemination of weather information to Air Force, Army, Guard, Reserve, and other supported forces.  Training includes providing classroom and on-the-job instruction essential for new AFW personnel to develop the necessary skills required to analyze and apply weather data effectively.  The training provided at each OWS is driven by actual requirements and the needs of the trainee.  Examples of the AFW standard information systems include the local area network, the OWS Production System II (OPS-II), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Portal (NOAAPort), the Open Principal User Processor Operation (OPUP), the Weather Product Management Distribution Systems (WPMDS), the Watches, Warning, and Advisories Management System (WWAMS), and associated databases and Air Force Weather Weapons Systems hardware/software.

FAST is capable of detecting beta lactams (both penicillins and cephalosporins), aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfas.  The business concern will need to generate or submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class listed above.  The business concern needs to submit a description of the method used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in an appropriate matrix (not water or buffer); limit of detection data on chloramphenicol and florfenicol; and the limits of detection for each drug tested.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, should also be submitted.  FSIS estimates 125,000 test analyses annually, but the agency cannot identify an approximate number until the testing method is implemented.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government is not requesting technical or management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender.

A. INTRODUCTION

The Office of Satellite Operations (OSO) of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) currently operates a joint Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program in conjunction with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). This joint system consists of two fully coordinated independent polar satellite systems that are referred to as the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS). As part of their IJPS operations, OSO currently provides telecommunications, networking, and Network Operating Center (NOC) capabilities to support the mission. As part of a new contract for the existing services provided to support the mission, OSO is looking for information and innovative capabilities from industry that will enable it to continue its current mission and enhance the service offerings for telecommunications and NOC services.

B. PURPOSE 

The goal of this RFI is to gather industry responses to desired requests in the following section, referred to as the Scope.  The industry responses will be used by OSO to refine the scope of future requirements for described services.  The Government will not be liable for any costs in preparing or submitting a response. In reviewing the responses, NOAA/OSO may request a meeting or teleconference with one or more respondent?s to gain further insight into the respondent?s capabilities. The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred by the respondent?s in these follow-up activities. The respondent?s are encouraged not to include marketing informational material as it will be discarded by the reviewers.  OSO also requests that the respondent?s address at least the following itemized list: 

-	A description of a high availability network that the respondent has maintained and how this can be relevant to the IJPS network
-	Previous experience where the respondent was able to balance compliance for requirements of a high security system against overall needs for operation
-	Explanation on how the respondent?s solutions and experience with Network Operation Center (NOC)  Services with other programs the scalability to add additional OSO programs in the future
-	Experience and lessons learned from previous projects where service transitions did not impact operations  

C. SCOPE

OSO is looking for the following types of services to support IJPS operations

Communications Services: 

The respondent shall be able to operate an IJPS Network that will provide commercial-grade data communications capabilities within the network using industry standard network components and protocols.  The IJPS network will consist of a communications link between Suitland (Maryland) and Darmstadt (Germany) that can handle a data throughput rate of at least 45 Mbps. The IJPS Network will also provide a backup link from Darmstadt to Suitland to handle telemetry and command data flows between Wallops Island (Virginia) and Darmstadt (Germany). In addition, the IJPS Network will consist of out-of-band communication links to handle the network management capabilities of the NOC.  

NOC Services: 

The respondent shall provide managed security services to monitor on a 24/7/365 basis IJPS Network and OSO enterprise networking equipment, such as spanning servers, switches/routers, firewall, servers, and network intrusion detection in Suitland (Maryland) , Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska). The NOC shall provide rapid notification and reporting of both system operational availability and/or system security issues following detection of a component failure or security intrusion incident.  

The overall security categorization for the IJPS Ground System is 

SC IJPS = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Therefore, the respondent shall meet Federal Security Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 800-53-A controls for high security system at the NOC.  The NOC service features shall also include, but are not limited to, Event Correlation across devices, Automated Inventory Audit and Reporting, Patch Management, and Vulnerability and Penetration Testing.  The NOC services will be required to provide backup NOC operations at another location.

Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Support Services: 

The respondent shall provide O&M services for the OSO enterprise networking infrastructure that supports IJPS operations. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to networking switching, routers, intrusion detection devices, firewalls, and telecommunications devices. The services will include, at a minimum, staging, configuration, updates, firewall rules changes and management.  The respondent will also be responsible for preventative maintenance and equipment lifecycle management. The OSO enterprise networking infrastructure is operating in Suitland (Maryland), Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska). 

In addition, the respondent shall provide O&M service to software applications for NOAA servers in Darmstadt that receive and forward satellite data and products from Darmstadt to Suitland. Services to be provided include modification of a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) software application product to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment.


D. DESIRED INFORMATION

The respondent will provide a turnkey fully integrated IJPS system to support requested services. Since solutions provided may require transition from existing operational capabilities, OSO is interested in innovative and flexible solutions in the respondent?s response that will address both the transition planning and how to minimize service disruption risks for telecommunications services. The respondent is also encouraged to share previous experience in services transition; references should be provided. 

The IJPS operations have an international dimension with OSO supporting enterprise infrastructure in Darmstadt (Germany). With the stringent performance requirements to respond to outages within four hours, the respondent will be required to identify their capabilities to support operations and maintenance in Germany. Previous response times from existing customers, with a reference, must be shared with OSO to verify the response time information.

The categorization of the IJPS system as a FISMA High system requires that the respondent provide a clear understanding to OSO as to the cost impact of this compliance. Also, OSO is asking the respondent to present efficiencies that they have gained from previous deployments. In particular, OSO is interested in learning about balancing the FISMA High compliance and the needs to have an operational, reliable, and cost effective system. The respondent shall elaborate on how the technologies they propose would provide the monitoring tools, structured processes, and experienced security analysis through event correlation to keep pace with evolving security threats.

OSO is also considering expanding the NOC services provided for IJPS to cover monitoring services for other programs and missions it supports. OSO is considering the implementation of a centralized NOC operated from its Satellite Operations facility in Suitland providing OSO the ability to quickly develop support for future programs. Therefore, the respondent is encouraged to share their experience with this type of implementation and address how their managed services tier structure would provide efficiencies that may enhance these services in Suitland. The respondent will address how they have integrated an information management security process with other government agencies.  The Respondent will also address training that has been provided to ensure that the agency has sufficient trained personnel.  Reporting requirements, which will be specified, are also critical for OSO.  The respondent shall describe the flexibility of customization and automated capabilities for monitoring their workstation and dashboard views. OSO is also keen on the respondent?s experience with insightful performance metrics that are gathered from network devices and included in their reporting. 

The respondent is asked to share their O&M experience in support of a wide range of enterprise networking platforms (including hardware, software, and operating systems).  OSO is interested in how the respondent?s services scale to meet service requirements and growth as well future technology upgrades.  Lifecycle management is also important to OSO and the respondent must demonstrate their knowledge, processes, and lessons learned from equipment phase in to the end of equipment operational life. 

The respondent will also provide their management and staffing plans which describes their organization, assignment of functions, duties, responsibilities, and reporting requirements for the conduct of the services requested by OSO.

<DESC>Request for information/ market research to identify organizations with the capability to construct and outfit hydrographic survey launches. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE

Contractors are asked to comment on NOAA?s proposed project objectives and time frames, corporate capability and approach, proposed products, services and solutions, experience and rough cost estimates. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI. The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to comment on this procurement, identify potential problem areas, and obtain alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these vessels. The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, clarifying ambiguous requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential contractual problem areas associated with the project.

Responses should be received by January 25, 2008. 

In addition to general industry feedback on the proposed vessels, comments are solicited regarding the following specific items:

1)	Identify proposed commercial, off the shelf products that may fulfill all or part of the project requirements.  Include comments on the availability of these COTS products through a GSA schedule.  
2)	Identify capacity to complete vessel construction within the proposed time periods.
3)	The government may choose to assess seaworthiness by incorporating sea trials in selection process.  Comment on feasibility of providing similar vessel for sea trials during evaluation period.
4)	Indicate business size and past experience with similar projects.
5)	Comment on proposed propulsion options (jet, propeller, I/O, other and experience with each option.


Scope of Work

The government anticipates awarding a contract in June 2008 to purchase two vessels to be delivered by January 2009.  The government anticipates that up to six additional vessels (for a total of up to eight vessels) may be acquired on an optional basis in subsequent years.  The anticipated delivery schedule of these vessels is two per year, but may be modified (either increase or decrease) subject to budgetary availability/ constraints.  These vessels are to be delivered completely rigged with all engines, power, equipment, and electronics in a ready to operate state.  Survey mission related equipment such as sonars, computers, positioning and not expected to be included with the vessel.  However, provision for later installation by the government including necessary mounts, fairings, racks, and operator stations are to be included with the delivered vessel.  The government intends to work with the selected vendor on specifics of this installation.

NOAA Survey Launch Requirements

General Description of  Hydrographic Survey Launch

Ships capable of deploying launches have been used for hydrographic survey for hundreds of years.  A launch is much more maneuverable than a ship, requires far fewer personnel to operate, and can be optimized for specialized hydrographic missions.  Launches also act as a force multiplier.  

The current 29? launches are equipped with various sonar systems, including single beam sonar, multibeam sonar, phase-differencing bathymetric sonar, and side scan sonar.  In typical coastal survey operations in the northern Pacific, the ship provides offshore survey coverage, transportation, hotel, and maintenance services, while the launches acquire the bulk of the inshore survey data.  

 
Figure 1: Current Launch Design

Requirement for Replacement

The existing launches have been modified and adapted over approximately 30 years of service.  Corrosion and general wear have gradually reduced the hull integrity of these vessels.  Leaks, cracks, and structural failures are becoming increasingly common, and repairs are becoming more difficult to achieve.  The launches, an integral part of NOAA?s survey capability, are becoming difficult to maintain in an operational status. 

General Design Assumptions

1.	New launches must fit in any of the aft four davits on RAINIER and FAIRWEATHER without modifications of davits or boats.  New boats are to be interchangeable with old. 

The current davit configuration of RAINIER and FAIRWEATHER allows all launches to fit in any davit, with the exception of the #2 davit on RAINIER.  While launches typically return to the same davit, it is operationally advantageous to be able to move launches around.  This provides for operational flexibility.  Some examples of when a boat may be lifted into another davit: when the ship is alongside a pier, to facilitate access to a boat for repairs, or davit maintenance.  This requirement also allows the replaced boats to be maintained as spares, allows the boats to be moved between ships, and encourages standardization.  Furthermore, the replacement of the launches is projected to be an incremental process, with about two produced per year, standardization and interoperability ensures maximum use of new assets. 

2.	Diesel Inboard Engine. 

RAINIER and FAIRWEATHER cannot carry sufficient amounts of gasoline for use as a launch fuel.  The stringent shipboard requirements for gasoline stowage make it an unattractive choice for future survey ships.  The long life, reliability, and ruggedness of diesel engines are also desirable attributes.  The engine and gear needs to be readily accessible for daily maintenance, and will likely need to be replaced during the service lifetime of the vessel.  

3.	Aluminum Hull

Survey launches are subjected to heavy use: they are often abruptly lifted by a two point lift, subjected to heavy sea conditions, and can be expected to collide with objects, occasionally run aground, and operate in ice conditions (the vessels will not be used for ice breaking).  The hulls are also likely to be modified to accommodate new sonar mounts, additional equipment, or modifications.  Fiberglass is more brittle and has less rigidity.  Steel is too heavy in this size application.

4.	Simple is better than complex

Survey launches are subjected to heavy use in remote locations.  Any maintenance not able to be performed by ship?s force is costly and time consuming.  Furthermore, simple systems tend to be more reliable than complex ones.  Reliability is an important factor in platform productivity, and is essential to safe operations. 


Requirements

Mission
The mission can be broken down into two categories: the current mission of the launches, and possible future mission.  The anticipated working area for these boats is coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. 

Current Mission
The current mission of NOAA hydrographic launches can be further broken down in to two distinct operations, 100% coverage of the seafloor with either multibeam bathymetry or side scan sonar, and shoreline verification.  Achieving 100% coverage involves running relatively straight, parallel lines.  This operation is typically conducted in waters between 4 and 400 meters deep, and, depending on local conditions, can be done with either multibeam or side scan sonar.  Multibeams are rigidly mounted to the hull.  Side scan sonars can be either hull mounted or towed.  Shoreline verification involves investigation of features that are either above the surface of the water at low tide or nearly so.  This mission often involves close inshore maneuvering of a vessel in shallow water.  Either outboard powered skiffs or jet drive launches are currently used for this mission because of their shoal draft and high maneuverability.  Single beam sonars are used on shoreline boats largely due to the increased risk of grounding and the expense and vulnerability of multibeam transducers.  Currently, two different platforms accomplish these missions, propeller driven launches with full keels for the 100% coverage, and keel-less jet launches or outboard powered skiffs for shoreline verification.  Launches are also used to support scuba diving operations, general transport, and occasional shore landing roles. 

Future Mission
Future missions of launches are likely to supplement the current ones.  Launches will likely be used to deploy and recover instrumentation such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV?s), GPS Tide Buoys, ADCP?s, and DART-3 buoys.  AUV?s are small vehicles that can operate independently of surface vessels.  They are likely to be used for water column profiling, side scan sonar operations, or possibly in multibeam sonar applications.  The classes of AUV?s likely to be deployed from a launch are either Man Portable class (less than 100 lbs) or Light Weight Vehicle class (less than 600 lbs).  Small buoys (less than 800 lbs) have also been developed that may be used to monitor the oceanographic conditions. 

These vessels are expected to be used approximately 1,500 hours per year.  

Sea Keeping/Stability
Survey launches often work in remote, exposed locations.  Weather and sea conditions can change rapidly, and boats may be far from the ship when they do.  This requires the launches to be able to withstand and safely transit in conditions beyond what is appropriate for survey work.   The launch should be able to safely transit areas in conditions up to Force 8 (Gale, 34-40kts, 18 ft fully developed seas).  Survey operations can be limited by excessive bubble entrainment under the hull and transducer through pounding and spilling waves as well as extreme crew discomfort.  Typically, survey work is not possible in conditions at or above Force 6 (22-27 kts, 10ft fully developed seas).  The launches often operate in near shore areas where seas can be steeper than in open waters.  A large angle of vanishing stability is highly desired to prevent capsize in steep waves.  Good sea keeping qualities also have a great effect on crew comfort, alertness, and productivity.  In general, an excessively snappy ride quality taxes the crew and degrades data quality. 

Dimensions 
The maximum dimensions are limited by RAINIER and FAIRWEATHER?s davit configuration.  

LOA:   29? 2?
Beam:  10? 10?
Distance between pick points: 20? 6?

The current maximum LOA of the launches, without any overlap, is 29? 2?.  This is the sum of the davit pick point spacing of 20? 6? plus the minimum separation between the aft falls of one davit and the forward fall of the aft davit (8? 8? between #4 and #6 davits).  

Range/ Endurance
Currently, a typical 8 hour day of survey operations begins at 0800 and ends at 1630.  During this period the launch can be expected to transit up to an hour each way and maintain survey speed for the remainder of the time.  However, survey days can extend up to 16 hours if two shifts are used.  

Speed
Transit: 25 kts or greater
?	Survey: 3-15 kts
?	Min: 2 kts

A major factor in operational planning is the transit distance between a protected deployment location and the working grounds of the launches.  Ten nautical mile transits from the ship are not uncommon.  For a launch working an eight hour day with a ten knot top speed (e.g. launches due for replacement), this results in 25% of the day being spent in transit.  A boat with a 25 knot speed would spend 10% of its day in transit.  Transit speed thus has a big impact in survey efficiency.  It also allows deployed crew to respond rapidly to changing weather and sea conditions.

The acquisition speed of a sonar launch is constrained by ping rate and along track resolution requirements.  Current multibeam sonar technology allows for only one ping to be traveling in the water column at any time:  the sonar generates an acoustic ping; waits for the return, and then pings again.  In deeper water this round trip naturally takes longer, but the resolution requirements typically decrease in deeper water.  Current along track sounding spacing requirements result in a maximum speed of approximately eight knots.  Multi-ping technology, capable of putting more than one ping in the water at a time, could soon allow survey launches to significantly increase survey speed while conducting multibeam survey operations.  The hull mounted Klein 5500, an advanced side scan sonar, currently employs multi-ping technology to achieve survey speeds of up to twelve knots.  

The survey speed of the launch may be dictated the surrounding hazards rather than technological restrictions.  Inshore, poorly survey areas require slow speeds, vigilant lookouts, and frequent maneuvers for safe operations.  In particularly hazardous areas, it may be necessary to creep along at two knots or less.  The launch should be able to maintain maneuverability at safe speeds in the near shore environment. 

Displacement
Weight of the launches is limited by davit capacity.  This weight also impacts the ship?s stability.  The current maximum weight under the current load test requirements (including all equipment, gear, and crew) is approximately 15,000 lbs.  While a lighter vessel will likely achieve better speed performance, heavier displacement designs may offer advantages in stability and reduced motion in short seas.

Crew Size
Current minimum crew is three people: one coxswain and two hydrographer/ sonar operators.  The third person allows for a dedicated lookout when required, allows for operational training, and is also required for a recovery of a man overboard. 

The launches are also used as tenders to the ships.  In this role they are expected to carry at least ten.  The launches would not be required to meet the speed or endurance requirements under this load.  

Visibility & Communication
Good visibility is required for both the coxswain and crew.  The coxswain needs a largely unobstructed view of the surrounding water for safe navigation, collision avoidance, and monitoring of environmental conditions.  The hydrographer needs to see the surrounding area to assist the coxswain in maintaining situational awareness, effectively plan the survey operations, and monitor the navigational significance of surrounding features.  The coxswain and hydrographer need to frequently communicate verbally to coordinate operations. 

Accommodations
The launch must have sufficient accommodations to comfortably support full day operations.  Comfortable and ergonomic work stations should be provided for the coxswain and sonar operators.  The sonar operator interfaces with the equipment via three to four 15? computer screens, a keyboard, and a mouse.  The crew is typically on board for over eight continuous hours a day.  Provision should be made for adequate ventilation, heating, and sound insulation of the crew spaces.  Some provision of a head facility should be made.  While air conditioning is not required, a plan should be available for how air conditioning could be provided if the launches were tasked to a warmer location. 

Approximately 5 feet of 19? shock mounted rack space for mission electronics should be included in an easily reached space that is easily accessible (both front and back) for maintenance and under way trouble shooting.

Sufficient deck space should be available for handling instrumentation likely to be deployed over the side.

Electrical Power Requirement
In addition to power to support basic functions of the boat (e.g lighting and navigation) approximately 5kW of 110 AC power should be provided for support of on board electrical loads.  Provision should be made for approximately 2kW of clean 110 AC suitable for electronic equipment. 

Construction Standard
All work shall confirm to ABYC standards. 

Planned Acquisition Approach

The government has not yet determined the specific approach to acquiring these vessels.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, Human Resources intends to issue a combined synopsis solicitation under FAR pt. 12 & 13. This requirement is being solicited on a full and open competitive basis. The North American Industry classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561920 size standard of $6.5M. The solicitation for this requirement will be DG1330-08-RQ-0148.  

I. 	BACKGROUND

Each spring, NOAA holds its Honor Awards ceremony to recognize winners of the Bronze Medal and Distinguished Career Awards.  This event consists of a pre-ceremony buffet breakfast beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m.  and lasting until about ten minutes before the beginning of the awards ceremony which is 10:30 a.m.  This breakfast will preferably occur in an area separate from where the awards ceremony will occur.  However, if the space is large enough, NOAA will consider holding its breakfast in the same room as the ceremony.  If this is the case, the breakfast area must somehow be set-off from where guests will sit during the presentation of the awards.

After the breakfast, the celebration will be moved into an auditorium (or similar setting) where NOAA officials address the recipients and publicly distribute the awards.  Following the ceremony is a small, informal dessert reception, which will take place in the same area as the breakfast.

II.	DATE OF CEREMONY

NOAA?s Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere is only available to present the awards on the following dates, in order of preference:
	
?	Wednesday, April 16, 2008
?	Thursday, April 17, 2008
?	Friday, April 18, 2008
					
*Please note that we require use of the venue the day prior to the event for set-up.  This means full access to the stage and seating area beginning no later than 10:00 am and commencing at 6:00 p.m.

 
III.	VENUE LOCATION

Because most of NOAA leadership, as well as a large number of NOAA employees, work in the Metro Washington, D.C. area, the ceremony must take place within a reasonable distance (within walking distance of a Metro station) from the NOAA Silver Spring Campus (intersection of East-West Highway and Colesville Road) or the Herbert C. Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. (Constitution Ave. and 14th St., NW).  

IV.	CAPACITY

This year, NOAA plans to recognize nearly 350 Bronze Medal and Career Award recipients.  An additional 30 NOAA officials will attend the ceremony.  As a result, with guests, the event requires seating capacity for between 800 and 1000 individuals seated theater-style in rows.

If chairs for the seating will need to be rented from the venue, please provide a separate cost breakdown for chair rental.  Please note that these chairs will be labeled with seat tags, which will be affixed using double-sided masking tape.

 
V.	BREAKFAST REQUIREMENTS

The venue must be able to host a catered breakfast buffet prior to the presentation of the awards.  This will be a buffet-style breakfast with limited seating (seating for between 60 and 100).  The breakfast will preferably occur in an area separate from where the awards ceremony will occur.  However, if the space is large enough, NOAA will consider holding its breakfast in the same room as the ceremony.  If this is the case, the breakfast area must somehow be set-off from where guests will sit during the presentation of the awards.

If the venue is able to provide in-house catering please make this a separate cost proposal from that of hosting the ceremony.  Catering proposals must include costs related to food and beverages, equipment rental, staff, set-up/breakdown, and delivery.

If the venue is unable to provide in-house catering, NOAA will contract with another vendor and will require full access to the loading, reception, and stage areas for food and equipment deliveries on the day prior to the ceremony, as well as the morning of the ceremony.  In addition, the caterer will require access to the venue after the ceremony ends around 1:30/2:00 p.m. to pick-up equipment and any remaining food.

Please see ?Timing/Set-up? section below for more information.

VI.	CEREMONY REQUIREMENTS

The venue should be of such a size that it can accommodate a breakfast reception and awards ceremony for between 800 and 1000 guests.  During the ceremony, the 800 ? 1000 attendees will be seated in rows facing a stage or raised platform.  This raised platform or stage is used to seat at least three NOAA dignitaries, as well as to present the awards.  On stage, NOAA will require the use of runner carpets (1 or 2).  NOAA will also require the use of staircases next to each side of the stage so that recipients can easily (and safely) access the stage when receiving awards.

NOAA will need to rent drapery to pipe and drape the stage and create a ?backstage? area so that the awards can be stored out of sight during the ceremony.

Please see ?Timing/Set-up? section below for more information.

VII.	DESSERT RECEPTION REQUIREMENTS

Following the ceremony?beginning between approximately 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.--will be a dessert reception to take place in the same area as the breakfast.  The dessert reception will consist of brownies, cookies, pastries, punch, coffee/tea, and possibly some cakes.  The desserts will be presented buffet-style with limited seating (not necessarily enough to accommodate all participants).  

If the venue is able to provide in-house catering please make this a separate cost proposal from that of hosting the ceremony.  Catering proposals must include costs related to food and beverages, equipment rental, staff, set-up/breakdown, and delivery.

If the venue is unable to provide in-house catering, NOAA will contract with another vendor and will require full access to the loading, reception, and stage areas for food and equipment deliveries on the day prior to the ceremony, as well as the morning of the ceremony.  In addition, the caterer will require access to the venue after the ceremony ends around 1:30/2:00 p.m. to pick-up equipment and any remaining food.

Please see ?Timing/Set-up? section below for more information.

VIII.	REGISTRATION

On the day of the ceremony, the awards recipients are required to sign-in at registration tables.  These registration tables must be set-up outside of the breakfast/ceremony area (but it must be indoors) so that when most of the recipients enter the venue, they will first come upon the registration tables.  NOAA will require six 8? rectangular registration tables skirted with royal blue (or equivalent) and white linens.  The registration area must be large enough to accommodate lines of at least 30 people.  These registration tables must be set-up and skirted by 12:00 p.m. on the day prior to the ceremony.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Special Notices to Offerors

a) The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C 423) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) as implemented in FAR.

b) Upon receipt, all responses to this RFP become Government property.

Submission of Complete Proposals
Offerors are cautioned to strictly comply with all instructions within this solicitation to ensure submission of a complete proposal.  Failure to furnish a complete proposal, at the time of proposal submission, may result in the proposal being unacceptable to the Government and elimination from consideration for award.

Proposal Format and Submission Instructions
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals is January 22, 2008 no later than 12:00.   Offerors assume full responsibility for ensuring that their proposals are received by the due date and time. Each proposal shall consist of two volumes:

	Volume I -  Technical Capability, electronic or original and 3 CD copies to include all data and information required for evaluation, and exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of the offer and shall include the following:  
Factor 1.  Technical Approach - IDIQ
Factor 2.  Past Experience with budget formulation and resource management software/modules
Factor 3.  Qualification of Key Personnel Proposed in Phase One

	Volume II - Price Proposal, electronic or original and 3 CD copies to include the completed solicitation documents and a complete and detailed cost breakdown with all supporting information requested in the Cost Breakdown portion of this solicitation.  Price evaluation will be conducted on each of the phases to determine price fair and reasonableness.

General Information - Submission of Proposals (Best Value)
Offerors are cautioned that the quality of their proposal and adherence to solicitation response requirements and/or restrictions are considered reflective of the manner in which the Offeror could be expected to conduct integration services and will be given due consideration throughout the evaluation process.  Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer unacceptable and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration award.

Volume I submissions are limited to the maximum number of pages in length of 20.  Each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8 " x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 points or greater with no more than 15 characters per inch (e.g. Times New Roman style with 12 point font).  Lines shall, at a minimum, be single spaced.   Pages shall be consecutively numbered.  Multiple pages, double pages, two-sided pages, and foldouts will count as an equivalent number of 8 " x 11" pages.  

The cover sheet, table of contents (not to exceed one page per volume), tabs, and dividers will not count toward the page limit. The cost proposal (Volume II) is not page limited.  However, the cost proposal is to be strictly limited to cost and price information.  

Resume(s) for Key Personnel for Phase One submitted as part of the offerors technical approach will not count toward the page limit for the Technical Proposal but may not exceed two (2) pages each for any resumes(s).

Evaluation Factors
The OCC will use the following factors to evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR 12.203 and FAR 15.304.  Technical capability is more important than past performance, but when combined technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than price.

1.	 Technical Capability

Technical capability ensures that the vendor is capable of fulfilling the OCCs solicitation requirements.  The OCCs assessment of technical capability will focus on the following:

  	 1) Technical approach and performance work statement in accordance with the Statement of Objectives, focusing on potential tasks contained in 3.1-3.5 of the SOO; 
	   2) Prior Experience with the resource management and budget formulation software and platforms; and 
       3) Qualifications of Proposed Key Personnel for Phase 1 (as provided in resume format).

2.	 Past Performance

For offerors without a record of relevant past performance, they shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance pursuant to FAR 15.305.

Offerors shall describe its past or current performance for three contracts.  Past performance should include similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which meets to general details as provided for within the solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

a) Contract Number(s);
b) Name and phone number of a point of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed;  
c) Dollar value of the Contract;
d) Detailed description of the work performed;
e) Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any and a description of the extent of work   performed by the subcontractor(s); and
f) The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the 
corrective action.

3. 	Price

Volume II, Containing the hourly pricing for the three phases listed under the Cost Schedule, as well as estimated hourly pricing for the labor categories listed under the second section of the Cost Schedule, will be the basis for price evaluation.

Determination of Best Value

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101 -1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. 

To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions; therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  If the Government decides that discussions are necessary, the CO may establish a competitive range of the most highly rated proposals.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  

The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  The realism of rates will be part of the proposal evaluation.  Unrealistic rates and pricing solutions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score.  OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK Project # 540-08-501 Angiographic Room Site Preparation 1. General Intention: It is the intention of the VA to acquire a contractor to prepare Room 2210 (X-Ray room) to accept the installation of a GE Innova 4100 system.  All work shall be in accordance with GE drawings C1, A1, S1, S2, E1, E2, E3, E4, D1 and D2 dated 5-14-07.  The contractor is responsible for all work noted on the drawings as Customer/Contractor supplied and/or installed. 2. Specific Work: The following are specific items but is not limited to all the work to be accomplished by the contractor in accordance with the drawings: A.	Cut holes in the existing floor and install the Table Baseplate, Positioner Baseplate and Chilled Water line.  The contractor shall use Ground Penetrating Radar to locate rebar and/or post tension cables located within the concrete floor.  The holes will be located to miss any cables/rebar and will be cut, core drilled or drilled.  The system can be positioned up to 2 towards the control wall and 18 towards the positioner end (coordinate with Project Engineer). B.	Install ductwork as shown on drawings. C.	Construct equipment room with sliding room doors (louvered for proper equipment ventilation). D.	Install Main Disconnect and power for equipment. E.	Install ceiling mounted cable drape rail. F.	Install chilled water line. G.	Install telephone/data wiring and outlets. H.	Install warning lights and door controller. I.	Relocate existing Medical Gases (AOV) to opposite side of room and have the system recertified. 3.  Infection Prevention Measures: A.	Implement the requirements of VAMCs Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) team. ICRA Group may monitor dust in the vicinity of the construction work and require the Contractor to take corrective action immediately if the safe levels are exceeded. B.	Establish and maintain a dust control program as part of the contractors infection preventive measures in accordance with the guidelines provided by ICRA Group//as specified here//. Prior to start of work, prepare a plan detailing project-specific dust protection measures, including periodic status reports, and submit to  Project  Engineer  and Facility ICRA team for review. 1.	All personnel involved in the construction or renovation activity shall be educated and trained in infection prevention measures established by the medical center. C.	Medical center Infection Control personnel shall monitor for airborne disease (e.g. aspergilluss) as appropriate during construction. A baseline of conditions may be established by the medical center prior to the start of work and periodically during the construction stage to determine impact of construction activities on indoor air quality. In addition: 1.	The PE and VAMC Infection Control personnel shall review pressure differential monitoring documentation to verify that pressure differentials in the construction zone and in the patient-care rooms are appropriate for their settings. The requirement for negative air pressure in the construction zone shall depend on the location and type of activity. Upon notification, the contractor shall implement corrective measures to restore proper pressure differentials as needed. 2.	In case of any problem, the medical center, along with assistance from the contractor, shall conduct an environmental assessment to find and eliminate the source. D.	In general, following preventive measures shall be adopted during construction to keep down dust and prevent mold.  1.	Dampen debris to keep down dust and provide temporary construction partitions in existing structures where directed by Resident Engineer. Blank off ducts and diffusers to prevent circulation of dust into occupied areas during construction. 2.	Do not perform dust producing tasks within occupied areas without the approval of the Resident Engineer. For construction in any areas that will remain jointly occupied by the medical Center and Contractors workers, the Contractor shall: a.	Provide dust proof one-hour temporary drywall construction barriers to completely separate construction from the operational areas of the hospital in order to contain dirt debris and dust. Barriers shall be sealed and made presentable on hospital occupied side. Install a self-closing rated door in a metal frame, commensurate with the partition, to allow worker access. Maintain negative air at all times. A fire retardant polystyrene, 6-mil thick or greater plastic barrier meeting local fire codes may be used where dust control is the only hazard, and an agreement is reached with the Resident Engineer and Medical Center. b.	HEPA filtration is required where the exhaust dust may reenter the breathing zone.  Contractor shall verify that construction exhaust to exterior is not reintroduced to the medical center through intake vents, or building openings. Install HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Accumulator) filter vacuum system rated at 95% capture of 0.3 microns including pollen, mold spores and dust particles. Insure continuous negative air pressures occurring within the work area. HEPA filters should have ASHRAE 85 or other prefilter to extend the useful life of the HEPA. Provide both primary and secondary filtrations units. Exhaust hoses shall be heavy duty, flexible steel reinforced and exhausted so that dust is not reintroduced to the medical center. c.	Adhesive Walk-off/Carpet Walk-off Mats, minimum 600mm x 900mm (24 x 36), shall be used at all interior transitions from the construction area to occupied medical center area. These mats shall be changed as often as required to maintain clean work areas directly outside construction area at all times. d.	Vacuum and wet mop all transition areas from construction to the occupied medical center at the end of each workday. Vacuum shall utilize HEPA filtration. Maintain surrounding area frequently. Remove debris as they are created. Transport these outside the construction area in containers with tightly fitting lids. e.	The contractor shall not haul debris through patient-care areas without prior approval of the Resident Engineer and the Medical Center. When, approved, debris shall be hauled in enclosed dust proof containers or wrapped in plastic and sealed with duct tape. No sharp objects should be allowed to cut through the plastic. Wipe down the exterior of the containers with a damp rag to remove dust. All equipment, tools, material, etc. transported through occupied areas shall be made free from dust and moisture by vacuuming and wipe down.  f.	Using a HEPA vacuum, clean inside the barrier and vacuum ceiling tile prior to replacement. Any ceiling access panels opened for investigation beyond sealed areas shall be sealed immediately when unattended. g.	There shall be no standing water during construction. This includes water in equipment drip pans and open containers within the construction areas. All accidental spills must be cleaned up and dried within 12 hours. Remove and dispose of porous materials that remain damp for more than 72 hours. h.	At completion, remove construction barriers and ceiling protection carefully, outside of normal work hours. Vacuum and clean all surfaces free of dust after the removal. E.	Final Cleanup: 1.	Upon completion of project, or as work progresses, remove all construction debris from above ceiling, vertical shafts and utility chases that have been part of the construction. 2.	Perform HEPA vacuum cleaning of all surfaces in the construction area. This includes walls, ceilings, cabinets, furniture (built-in or free standing), partitions, flooring, etc. 3.	All new air ducts shall be cleaned prior to final inspection ELECTRONIC VERSION OF DRAWINGS AVAILABLE BY E-MAIL END
