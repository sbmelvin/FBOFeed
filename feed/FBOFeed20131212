The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</a> on the issue date of 12/30/13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). The approved source is Meggitt (North Hollywood) (79318). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Northwest Mountain Region is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind.

Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if adequate competition exists to set the requirement a side for certified Small Economicaly Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB)/   8(a) program, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Small Businesses in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey. Therefore, any costs associated with vendor's market survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

LAX ATCT ADMINISTRATION BUILDING ROOF REPAIR SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment (except Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)), transportation, insurance, notifications, licenses, permits, fees, inspections, testing, scheduling, reporting, submittals and supervision necessary for the facility improvements for roof repair of the LAX ATCT Administrative Base Building at the LAX 
International Airport, Los Angeles, California.  The work shall include but is not limited to the following:

I.	General Description: 

A)	Install new membrane roofing system (KEE or PVC) with Simulated Metal Roofing Profile. See contractors qualifications below.

B)	Remove existing and new cladding on the Fascia and Soffit Areas for Roof #3

C)	Other Items: 
1-	Test existing tie-off anchors on roof.
2-	Provide a water diffuser on water drainage from pipes in integral gutters.
3-	Remove Lightning Protection System as needed during re-roofing work and replace.

II.	Detailed Description of Work:

A.	Membrane Roofing System 
Contractor will perform an uplift resistance test on existing metal roof prior to installing the membrane roofing system.  The FAA will identify which areas are required to be tested. If test results are found to be adequate contractor shall proceed with the new membrane system installation as follows:

Install a membrane roofing system that uses a Simulated Metal Roof Profiles (SMRP) roofing membrane to give the appearance of a metal roof.  The profiles shall be permanently adhered in a thermally activated adhesive and the membrane comes in standard colors of light or dark grey. 

The membrane roofing system would consist of the following components (listed in order from innermost to outermost component):
	Rigid insulation  1  deep rigid insulation will be provided in the valleys of the existing roofing system between the standing seam ridges.  The width of the rigid insulation will vary depending upon the width between the standing seams, but will be identified as typically 12 on the design drawings based upon the standard 12  spacing between the existing roofs standing seam ribs.   The 1  depth is selected for the rigid insulation to provide assurance that the sheathing board laid atop it will clear all of the existing standing seam ribs.  The rigid insulation will be glued to the valleys of the metal existing standing seam roof.

	Exterior sheathing board - one layer of  thick exterior sheathing board (Densdeck or equivalent) will be attached atop the rigid insulation.  The one layer of  thick board is used instead of one  layer since the  thick board will be better able to conform to the curve of the roof, particularly the bid-directional curves associated with Roofs #1 and #3.  The exterior sheathing board will be mechanically anchored to the existing structure metal deck. The anchorage of the exterior sheathing board will need to take into account all aspects of wind uplift loading on the roof (as defined in ASCE-7).  This will result in an anchorage pattern that will have the highest concentration of anchors at the corners, a lesser amount at the edges and the least amount (largest spacing between anchors) at the interior portions of the roof.

The  board does not have very good spanning capabilities where there is a gap in the 1  rigid insulation at the existing standing seam, however per information provided by the manufacturer it can span unsupported up to 2 .  The span at the gap for the vast majority of the roof construction should be less than 2, however if the span exceeds 2 as noted in the drawings then the gap shall be filled with foam insulation. The surface of foam insulation shall be cut to align with top of rigid insulation, on both sides, before installation of exterior sheathing.

	Single-ply roofing membrane  45 - 60 mil thick .  The membrane complies with the very stringent ASTM D 6754 Standard.   The 45 -60 mil single-ply roofing membrane (Ethylene Interpolymer KEE or PVC) as per specification 07 54 16 provides a 20 year labor and material warranty.

The roofing will be fully adhered to the exterior sheathing board.  Supplemental mechanical attachments may be required at the corner and edge conditions for the membrane depending upon the wind uplift loading (see discussion for wind loading under the previous bulleted item).  

	Welded simulated metal roofing profile (SMRP)  a welded rib will be adhered to the roof with a height of approximately 1 to match the appearance of the existing metal standing seam roofing system.  The welded seams are strictly cosmetic.  The seams will be installed in a straight line.  Due to the bidirectional curve for Roofs #1 and #3 the SMRP will not necessarily be straight with the east and west boundaries of those roofs.  This is much like the current condition with the standing seam metal roof.  On Roof #2 since it is not bi-directional the SMRP ribs will be parallel with the east and west ends of the roof.

At roofs with bi-direction slopes (Roofs #1 and #3) the seams will have gaps at the base, but not at the top of the rib, between the attachment points.  This will prevent water from accumulating on the uphill side of the seam.  The gaps will be provided only in the areas that are relatively flat in the opposite direction.  For example at Roof #1 the gaps at the western end will be located within the middle 10-15 feet of the seams overall length and those at the eastern end (constant elevation at the bullnose edge) will extend for the full length of the seam.  

The spacing of the SMRP for Roof #1 will match the spacing of the existing fascia panels on the north and south sides of the roof.  The spacing of the SMRP for Roof #3 will match the spacing of the new ribbed fascia panels that will be installed on the north and south facades (approximately 12 on-center).  The spacing of the SMRP for Roof #2 is not dependent upon any edge conditions.  A spacing of 12 on-center will be indicated for this roof, with the initial rib equally spaced from the integral gutters on the east and west ends of the roof.

Edge Condition Treatment for the Membrane Roof

There are multiple conditions for the end of the roofs.  The following is a summary of the proposed treatment of the new roof at the various edge of roof conditions:

Roof #1

	The integral gutter that is parallel with the existing standing seam roof ribs on the inside face of a composite aluminum panel bullnose (east end) will have the new roof stop at the inside face of the integral gutter.  The roof will be flashed into the integral gutter.  

	The integral gutters that are perpendicular with the existing standing seam roof ribs that merge with ribbed fascia panels (north and south ends) will have the new roof stop at the inside face of the integral gutter.  The roof will be flashed into the integral gutter.  The ribs at the intersection of the fascia panel to the roof will be trimmed either at the miter at the roof seam intersection (if the roof seam is not attached at the outside face of the gutter) or vertically at the outside face of the gutter (if the roof seam is attached to the outside face of the gutter).  In either case an end enclosure will cap the trimmed fascia panel rib. 

	The integral gutter that is parallel with the existing standing seam roof ribs at the roof the GFRC wall panel intersection (west end) will have rigid insulation placed into the existing gutter and the new roof membrane will be carried over the existing gutter and terminated at the face of the GFRC wall panel.  This treatment is being done because the caulk joint at the bottom of the GFRC panel (towards the bottom of the integral gutter) will become inaccessible after the reroofing raises the elevation of the roof.  To solve this problem the roof will be taken over the existing gutter and the joint will no longer need to be treated in the future.

Roof #2

	The integral gutters that are parallel with the existing standing seams (east and west ends) will have the new roof stop at the inside edge of the integral gutter and the built-up sides of the new roof flashed into the existing integral gutter.  The existing lighting protection system (LPS) elements (antenna and conductor) will not be impacted by the construction at the edge and can be left in place during construction.

	The integral gutters that are perpendicular with the existing standing seams and that terminate at an integral gutter on the inside face of a composite aluminum panel bullnose (north and south ends) will have the new roof stop at the integral gutter.  The roof will be flashed into the integral gutter.  Additionally since the existing gutter has insufficient capacity the gutter capacity will be increased by adding a continuous plate on the outside of the gutter that will raise the depth of the gutter to allow it to hold more volume of storm water.  The addition of the plate and the flashing around the added plate will likely require removal and reattachment of the LPS elements that are attached within the existing gutter.  

Roof #3

	The integral gutter that is parallel with the existing standing seam roof ribs on the inside face of a composite aluminum panel bullnose (west end) will have the new roof stop at the inside face of the integral gutter.  The roof will be flashed into the integral gutter.  

	The integral gutter that is parallel with the existing standing seam roof ribs at the roof the GFRC wall panel intersection (east end at the north and south sides of the Terrace) will have rigid insulation placed into the existing gutter and the new roof membrane will be carried over the existing gutter and terminated at the face of the GFRC wall panel.  This treatment is being done because the caulk joint at the bottom of the GFRC panel (towards the bottom of the integral gutter) will become inaccessible after the reroofing raises the elevation of the roof.  To solve this problem the roof will be taken over the existing gutter and the joint will no longer need to be treated in the future.

	The integral gutters that are perpendicular with the existing standing seam roof ribs that merge with ribbed fascia panels (north and south ends) will have the new roof stop at the inside face of the integral gutter.  The roof will be flashed into the integral gutter.  The current detailing of false ribs that span across the integral gutter will not be continued with the new detailing.  The new standing seam fascia panels will however be extended above the existing gutter by approximately 2 to prevent water overflowing the gutter given the raised elevation of the new roof relative to the existing gutter.   

	The roof edges that terminate into fascia panels that do not have integral gutters and the existing fascia panels are to remain (where it interfaces with the fascia panels on the Fifth Floor Terrace) will be detailed to have the new roof terminate with flashing extending over the existing fascia panels.  The ribs on the existing fascia panels will need to be trimmed horizontally at the top to allow the roof flashing termination.  Removal and replacement of the Terrace guardrail will be required to perform the roof edge work at these locations.   

	The roof edges that terminate into fascia panels that do not have integral gutters and the existing fascia panels are to be replaced (at the inside face of panels where the roof is gapped from the ATCT shaft) will be detailed to have the new roof terminate with flashing extending over the new fascia panels.  

	The roof edges terminating along the ATCT will have substantial modifications.  The original design had an integral gutter at this intersection that also was an expansion joint.  Over time the gutter leaked and the fix to the leak placed a plate over the integral gutter from the roof the face of the ATCTs GFRC panels.  This fix compromises the free movement of the joint required for proper expansion joint behavior.  The new detailing will remove the cover plate and then provide a roof curb along the edge of the existing roof.  A new bellows expansion joint will be placed between the new roof curb and the ATCT GFRC wall.  There will not be a gutter provided, instead stormwater will be directed over the roof curb to the adjacent roof surface for drainage down to the gutter on the north and south ends of Roof #3.   

B.	RECLADDING DESIGN

Cladding of the Fascia and Soffit Areas for Roof #3
The proposed cladding of the fascia and soffit areas associated with Roof #3 will require the removal of the existing metal fascia and soffit panels.  The recommendation to remove the fascia and soffit panels is made for several reasons.  The reasons are as follows:
	By removing the fascia and soffit panels to the metal deck substrate there is better exposure to the existing 1 5/16 deep continuous metal backing system that will support the new fascia or soffit panels.  

	If the new fascia and soffit panels were placed atop the existing standing seam fascia and soffit the gap between the existing standing seam panel and the back side of the new standing seam panel would need to be filled by the same materials (rigid insulation or top hat) used for the roof.  This would increase the complexity of the cladding effort and may impact the ability to achieve a warranted finished product.

	If the new cladding left the existing fascia and soffit in place the increased thickness of these elements would create some detailing issues.  For example, where the soffit interfaces with the head of the aluminum storefront system on the north and south faade of the western portion of the Administrative Base Building (see Photo #20 in Appendix 1) there would be a difficult transition with an overlay situation.

The demolition of the existing fascia and soffit will damage the existing waterproofing membrane currently beneath it.  The damaged existing membrane will be fully removed.  The new cladding effort will require the application of a new membrane atop the existing metal deck substrate.  Rather than use a sheathing board atop the metal deck substrate it is recommended that a heavier gage metal panel system be used.  The heavier gage will be required to eliminate any potential oil-canning due the lack of a sheathing board back-up.  In our opinion the sheathing board would be cumbersome to apply in a vertical or underside application and the added cost of a heavier gage metal will be offset by a reduction in installation cost due to the elimination of the sheathing element.

Cladding Material Information

The new fascia and soffit panels will use a standing seam metal system based on a Galvalume panel.  The Galvalume metal panel is selected over an ordinary galvanized product because of better outdoor corrosion resistance and longevity for the environmental factors associated with the project.

Galvalume is a trademarked name, but it is used as a generic term to describe a metal panels product consisting of steel coil coated with a metal alloy.  That alloy is 45% zinc and 55% aluminium.  It looks similar to galvanized steel, but the visible crystals are smaller and close together, giving it a smoother appearance.  Galvalume has an upgraded product identified as Galvalume Plus.  The only difference is the plus version has a thin, clear acrylic coating.  Because Galvalume Plus can be roll-formed dry without vanishing oil, it is very easy to form and install safely.

The combination of zinc and aluminium in Galvalume for the fascia and soffit panels enhances both the positive and negative effects of aluminium.  Galvalume has barrier corrosion resistance and heat resistance similar to aluminized material and good bare edge galvanic protection and forming qualities like galvanized material.  Consequently, Galvalume and Galvalume Plus will resist rust and the elements while providing a sturdy and protective covering.

Galvalume is more corrosion-resistant than galvanized steel, but because aluminium provides barrier protection instead of galvanic protection, scratches and cut edges are less protected.  Galvalume is offered in both bare and pre-coated versions.  Most Galvalume, like galvanized steel, is coated.  But Galvalume has an excellent performance life in bare exposures as well.  Both galvanized steel and Galvalume weigh 100 to 150 pounds per 100 square feet and contain about 35% recycled materials.  The cost of Galvalume and Galvalume Plus are about the same as that of galvanized steel.  

The coating used on Galvalume is very important because it is critical to the length and conditions of the entire warranty of the panel product. Coated metal panels have progressed from a single coat straight polyester paint system in the early years to Poly vinyl idene fluoride (PVDF) acknowledged as the premium resin for coil coatings.  It is a kind of fluoride, a family that includes such well known products as Teflon and Halar.  PVDF resin has superior chalk resistance and gloss retention as well as stain and chemical resistance.  It is softer than polyester, making it highly formable without risk of cracking.  Current pretreatments and primers along with superior paint coating have increased product warranties dramatically.

Galvalume should not be used on, in, or around concrete or mortar.  Concrete and mortar are highly alkaline environments.  Bare Galvalume and painted Galvalume sheets suffer rapid corrosion when in contact with mortar and concrete.  Bare Galvanized and painted Galvanized perform better in this type of environment.

Installation Information

The new ribbed fascia and soffit panels will employ typical spacing that within the manufactures standard line.  The rib spacing will be approximately 12 on-center.  The start of the spacing of the panel standing seam ribs will be from the east end of the fascia associated with Roof #3.  The spacing of the soffit panel ribs will match the fascia panel ribs.  Ribbed fascia panels will provided on the north and south facades.  Ribbed soffit panels will be provided at all replaced soffits. 

Where the existing fascia panel is a flat panel, a new flat panel (as opposed to standing seam panel) will be provided to be able to mimic the top and bottom detailing of the flat panel where it interfaces with the flat section of the roof panel (membrane or standing seam metal option).  Additionally on the inside face panels to the north of the ATCT shaft the current ribbed panel configuration will be replaced with a flat panel.  It is felt that that the ribs on this face are hardly visible and on the south side the panels will be better detailed into the existing louver.   

C)	OTHER DESIGN ASPECTS

Proposed Solutions for Other Roofing Elements

Other elements within the plane of the roof, or at the perimeter of the roof that will require consideration during the reroofing of the roofs includes the following: 
Tie-Off Anchors
There are quite a few tie-off anchors on the roofs that are intended for fall protection for anyone that goes on the roof.  The original design drawings referred to these anchors as Safety tie-rack anchor by building maintenance system.  Given the vague nature of the note on the drawing and the inability to find any of the original submittal information (shop drawings or design cut-sheets) that may have provided more information regarding the capacity of the tie-off anchors, it is impossible to determine the exact make-up of the anchors and their ability to resist OSHA prescribed fall protection loads.

As an initial task the Contractor shall test each of the anchors on the roof under construction with a testing mechanism that can test the tie-offs to the OSHA required load.  If the tie-offs meet the loading requirement it will be allowable for the Contractor to use them during the construction of the new roof and no further modification will be required.  If the tie-offs fail the load test remedial action will need to be undertaken to either strengthen the existing tie-off, or replace the tie-off with one that has adequate capacity.  For the purposes of the bid documents it will be assumed that the tie-offs will meet the testing requirements and no remedial action will be necessary.  The Contractor, however, will be required to include testing of all of the tie-off anchors in his bid.
Water Drainage from Pipes in Integral Gutters

The scope of work for this project specifically identified the drainage pipe at the northwest corner of Roof #2 as a concern for the site.  During heavy rainfalls the water from this pipe pours directly onto the sites north pedestrian gate.  

The proposed solution for this issue is to provide a screened deflector mounted below the bottom of the existing drain pipe.  The deflector will be cone shaped with the narrow side of the cone attached to the existing pipe. At the bottom of the cone, at the larger end of the cone, a mesh will be provided that will break up any potential stream of water and cause the stream to become dispersed.  With the great height that the water drops from any initial dispersion of the water will become magnified.  The only concern with this solution is the potential for the screened bottom to become clogged.  The increase in diameter at the bottom of the deflector from the top is intended to alleviate the potential for this problem.

Although Roof #2s northeast corner was identified as being the most problematic condition, this modification will be provided for all drains from Roof #2 (four on north end and four on south end).  The modification will not be provided on the two locations each on the north and south ends where the drains also contain conduit filled with conductors for the LPS.  The modification to the drains will not be applied to any other roofs.

Lightning Protection System (LPS)

Per discussion with FAA during the pre-proposal phase, portions of the existing lightning protection on the roofs can be temporary disassembled in order to facilitate the re-roofing effort.  Maintaining a continuous loop of the system is not a requirement during the construction efforts.  

In areas where the re-roofing impacts the existing routing or mounting of the equalization loop conductor or the air terminals, those LPS components shall be temporary removed and reinstalled upon completion of the re-roofing process.  Contractor shall field verify to determine if the existing mounting hardware can be reused.  Provide new UL rated hardware as required.  All work related to the LPS shall be in compliance with FAA STD-019e and NFPA 780.
Most of the LPS system (antenna and conductors) for Roof #2 are mounted in the integral gutter at the edge of the roof.  From visual inspection during the initial site survey (from fairly far away) these elements will likely not be impacted by the new work. 

III.	Contractors Qualifications:

1.	Quality Assurance

<DESC>This notice is seeking responses from potential partners interested in entering into a Cooperative Agreement with NASA for the joint development of technologies to meet MSFC interests as well as those of the partner. These MSFC technology development projects are sponsored by the Center Associate Director, Technical, and managed at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL. &lt;p&gt; To minimize unnecessary proposal efforts on the part of proposers, the partnership selection is a two-step process that consists of the submission of an initial White Paper to see if the proposed technology development concept appears to meet the interests at Marshall. For the technology concepts selected among all submitted White Papers, the White Paper will be followed with a request from the Marshall Associate Director, Technical for a Project Proposal. The White Papers and invited Project Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions in this announcement and shall meet the project requirements identified. The projects will be selected based on the criteria described in the following sections of this announcement. &lt;p&gt; NASA plans to fund projects in the remainder of FY2014 at approximately $20,000 to $90,000 per project with a period of performance up to 12 months. There is flexibility in these funding levels that is subject to negotiation. Project awards are contingent upon availability of funds. The participating partner will contribute an equal value of resources to match the NASA resources for the project. The projects will be joint technology development efforts in the areas indicated in Section 2.1 that will include collaboration with NASA or NASA support contractor personnel. NASA expertise and facilities may be available for use in the technology development and demonstration if needed but shall be stipulated in the agreement and negotiated prior to proposal submission. &lt;p&gt; Under this notice, NASA will award Cooperative Agreements in accordance with the applicable sections of the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook (the Handbook) Section D. The Handbook is available on the Internet at: &lt;p&gt; https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/grcover.htm &lt;p&gt; Under a Cooperative Agreement, the funding agency will have substantial involvement in, and contribution to, the technical aspects of the effort. Cooperative Agreements differ from grant programs where there is no substantial involvement of the funding agency in monitoring the work or research program. This type of notice also allows contact with the potential subject matter experts at Marshall Space Flight Center during the CAN open period subject to the limitations set forth in the Handbook. Particular attention is directed to Section D, 1274.203(f). &lt;p&gt; The agreements officer for this notice is MSFC/PS51, Belinda Triplett (belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov).

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for membership with Internet2. Payment of the membership fee allows NASA ESDIS Project to be a member of the University Consortium for Advanced Internet Design (UCAID) with Internet2. &lt;p&gt; NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the service from Internet2. Through Internet2 membership, the community focuses on developing and deploying advanced networking technologies and capabilities in service of U.S. research and higher education. &lt;p&gt; Internet2 provides the ESDIS Project with a dynamic and innovative packet network. The network was designed to provide next-generation production services as well as a platform for the development of new networking protocols. ESDIS uses this network as a back-up to the NASA Internet to support network traffic to the NASA data centers and science investigator processing systems at several Universities. &lt;p&gt; NASA has maintained membership with UCAID for Internet for over 10 years through various procurements at GSFC. This procurement provides continuity to existing ESDIS networks. There are no other vendors that can provide this support. Internet2 is a consortium developed network and is proprietary.  This membership allows NASA to be part of the Internet2 Consortium. There are no alternatives to gain access to this network. &lt;p&gt; No alternatives exists to the Internet2 infrastructure at this date that provides the speed and reliability required by the ESDIS Project for its satellite missions. &lt;p&gt; The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 27, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. &lt;p&gt; Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &lt;p&gt; All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Newport Corporation, 3635 Peterson Way, Santa Clara, CA 95054-2809, to provide maintenance services on the Newport Spectra-Physics lasers located in the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT:</p>
<p>-	Gold Level Lasercare (on-site maintenance for one (1) year.  Covers parts, labor, and travel, excluding consumables) on the following lasers (with serial numbers):<br />o	MaiTai BB DS (serial number 1602-R1)<br />o	MaiTai HP DS x 2 (serial numbers 3349 and 3128)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Four Newport Spectra-Physics lasers (three MaiTai and one Millenia Xs pump laser) in the NHLBI DIR are in need of a one year maintenance agreement.  These lasers are owned by three labs in the DIR (Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, Optical Spectroscopy Section, and the NHLBI Light Microscopy Facility) and are used on a daily basis to provide two-photon excitation light for optical microscopy experiments for many NHLBI researchers.  These lasers are very complicated and are delicate scientific instruments that typically require many service visits over the course of a year.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Newport is the manufacturer of these lasers and only the manufacturer is authorized to provide maintenance or repair.   Any third party performing maintenance would immediately void the warranty.  Replacement parts must also be compatible with existing equipment and can only be provided by Newport.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is $19.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-71 (November 25, 2013).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by December 18, 2013 at 9:00am EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2014-032-JML.  Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan M.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />&nbsp;<br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a contract to Stanford University for support of the NIDA Division of Epidemiology, Services, and Prevention Research's National Pain and Chronic Disease Registry without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).<br />
<p><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 with a Size Standard of $14 Million.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong> <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-71 dated November 25, 2013.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>According to the Institute of Medicine Report, over 100 million people in the U.S. still suffer from unwanted pain at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars each year in indirect costs and direct medical expenses. As a result of this, there has been a great increase in the number of treatments available for chronic pain management. Yet in many cases it is not known which treatments are most effective or safest. This information could be obtained through comparative effectiveness studies which could be developed with a Pain Registry. Pain Registries currently exist, but they are commercial products with expensive fees placing them out of the reach of many potential users. The National Institutes of Health is interested in implementing a free open source and open standard National Pain Registry. This work was begun via a contract with Stanford University and sources are now sought to support continued development of National Pain Registry requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this potential requirement is acquisition of support to continue development of an open source, open framework, and freely available National Pain Registry. This work will promote widespread collection of patient outcomes data for point of care decision making and longitudinal assessments of treatment efficacy. <br /><br /><strong>Period of Performance<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is 1/1/2013 through 6/30/2014. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated.<br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>To Contractor must be able to perform the following tasks:<br />1. Provide pain medicine experts and computer experts to further refine the currently developed functional Pain Registry prototype using NIDA PROMIS CAT modules. <br />2. Beta-test the prototype Pain Registry.<br />3. Contact other pain medicine practices for data contributions.<br />4. Analyze data to provide assessment on longitudinal treatment effectiveness outcomes. <br />5. Scale Pain Registry for installation, configuration, integration, operation, and maintenance at multiple sites.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, this is a follow-on requirement and the intended award will serve to continue current Pain Registry development support. The Pain Registry development has already begun and to start over with a new contractor would unnecessarily duplicate effort and expense. There are no other vendors in the current marketplace who can provide both the information technology and medical expertise to continue development of the required registry.</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>Stanford University<br />Stanford, CA 94305</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">This synopsis provides notice that the Government anticipates to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services, Inc. (hereby referred to as BAE Systems) of Rockville, Maryland, under Seaport-e task order N00178-04-D-4018/M801. The period of performance for this extension will begin 1 January 2014 and end on 30 June 2014. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This will provide an additional level of effort of 180,039 hours for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLIN and Cost Reimbursable CLINs, for a period of six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The additional level of effort will allow for the continuity of critical integration and engineering technical services required to support the Identification Systems Division (IDS), 4.5.9 NAWCAD, St. Inigoes, MD, until the pending bridge contract, estimated award of 1 July 2014, assigned to Patuxent River is awarded. This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling 31 December 2013. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00178-04-D-4018-M801 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will consider all information received by 27 December 2013 1530 EST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will not pay for any information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No telephone responses will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions shall be submitted to Kelli Holmes, Code 2.5.1.4.8, Telephone (301) 737-2533, Fax (301) 737-2096, or via email <a href="mailto:Kelli.holmes@navy.mil">Kelli.holmes@navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

Procurement Office: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund Regional Operations Division (3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s Office of Superfund Regional Procurement Operations Division, intends to award a sole source firm-fixed priced purchase order for one 960 high vacuum canister cleaning system. The intent is to issue the purchase order to Xonteck Incorporated located at 187 Tank Farm Road, Suite 140, San Luis Obispo, California 93401.
This specific provider has been requested because the Xonteck Incorporated model 960 Canister Cleaner is the only instrument that is fully compatible with the existing VOC laboratory auxiliary canister cleaning units.  This compatibility is critical to ensure continuity of operations if one our other aging instrument fails.  Seamless, transparent communication is necessary between and among the platform of instrumentation (Xonteck) for canister cleaning that is currently in operation in the EPA NERL HEASD VOC Laboratory.  Introducing other vendor instrumentation would only hinder this requirement. The intended order is in the amount of $32,410.00. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. All questions and comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Dionne Wright, Contract Specialist, at wright.dionne@epa.gov. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. 
The point of contact for this procurement is Dionne Wright, Contracting Specialist, at wright.dionne@epa.gov

<p style="text-align: left;">Maximum ABOA square feet: 55,000</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is for ten years. The space must be available for occupancy by September 30, 2013. The delineated area is North - Callaghan Rd, East - IH-10/ West Interstate 10, South - Vega Drive, West Torino Drive.</p>
<p><br />Other applicable requirements include the following features:</p>
<p>- Proximity to public transportation<br /><br />- Parking [reserved spaces (surface) for official Government vehicles]<br /><br />- Security [lobby, loading dock access, parking, setbacks etc, where and as applicable]</p>
<p><br />The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Dusty Griffith<br />Contracting Officer, Public Buildings Service<br />819 Taylor Street, Room 5A18, Fort Worth, TX 76102<br />817.978.4335<br />dusty.griffith@gsa.gov</p>

Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br /><br />- Date of space availability<br /><br />- Building ownership information<br /><br />- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br /><br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building<br /><br />- List of building services provided</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

All who would like to participate in the upcoming Industry Day MUST provide contact information and number of attendees to the following email address: <br>  <br>  	usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-tcil-industry-day@mail.mil <br>  <br>  	The 2014 TCIL Industry Day format will be an overview of current fielded technologies followed by an overview of the future technologies being evaluated.  The Analyst Working Group (AWG) will then present capabilities being sought.  Industry partners will be given a list with descriptions of the capabilities being sought.   <br>  <br>  	Vendors will then be given a 45 day period to deliver back to the I2WD government staff a white paper with supporting documentation for consideration to come back to demonstrate the capability and how it can be used in the current environment to fill one or more of the capabilities desired by I2WD. <br>  <br>  	Within 45 days after, the Government will provide written feedback to each vendor who presented.  This feedback will indicate the Government's desire to pursue further discussions and/or invite the vendor back for a more in-depth demonstration, or thank the vendor for his or her presentation.  <br>  <br> All questions regarding this event are to be sent via e-mail to: <br>  <br> usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-tcil-industry-day@mail.mil

<DESC>This is a new procurement that will replace local services agreements that are in place in four of the GSA regions, the National Capital Region (NCR) and Regions 1, 2 and 3. <br /><br />The Government is seeking suggestions as to the best way to provide Voice and Video Services, Data, Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Telecommunications Service Related Labor, Cable and Wiring, COOP Services, Data Center/Cloud Services and all necessary telecommunications support services for the government worker to perform the agency mission in rapidly changing and dynamic environments. <br /><br />This approach focuses on office environments, field environments and telework environments, where the government user may require unified communications services utilizing the entire suite of hardware and software desktop products and services to perform the agency mission.<br /><br />With the WITS 3 contract set to expire in November 2015, and the LSA contracts set to expire shortly thereafter, GSA is preparing an acquisition to complement and eventually replace all of the current contracts.

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong><br />The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, supporting the discovery and development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the discovery and development of vaccines and other prevention strategies. The current NIAID Clinical Pharmacology Quality Assurance (CPQA) program provides a comprehensive quality assessment program for clinical pharmacologic laboratories testing samples from subjects enrolled in NIAID-supported clinical studies to ensures the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of pharmacological study data by providing laboratories with materials for pharmacology proficiency testing and assay controls, and monitoring proficiency and assay data from each laboratory. This program serves a critical need in ensuring that the individual laboratories (1) adequately validate their methods such that they are specific, accurate, reproducible, and sufficiently sensitive to measure drug concentrations in clinical specimens, (2) accurately analyze and report drug concentrations from patient specimens, and (3) are organized, directed, and managed in accordance with the quality requirements of NIAID and/or regulatory agencies. Therefore, it is critical to continue the CPQA program that assures the scientific integrity of NIAID supported on-going and future clinical studies concerning assessment of anti-HIV treatments and preventive measures.
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed contract will be to continue to provide a comprehensive quality assurance program (CPQA) resources to: (1) evaluate the ability of Labs to accurately and reliably perform study-specified pharmacology assays; (2) provide for the planning and execution of single and multi-Lab studies for the development, validation and implementation of bioanalytical methods for measuring drug concentrations in study specimens; (3) acquire, characterize, store, and distribute to Labs quality control materials and reagents; (4) provide guidance and assistance to Lab and clinical site staff in proficiency testing, assay validation and in the conduct of clinical pharmacology studies; and (5) prepare Labs for FDA inspections and study audits.</p>
<p>The current CPQA program contract was awarded to the University at Buffalo, Research Foundation of State University of New York, on May 29, 2008 for a total period of seven years (Contract No, HHSN272200800019C). The current contract provides services to 11 U.S. and non-U.S. clinical pharmacology laboratories (Labs) affiliated with NIAID-supported clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups). It is critical to evaluate, both initially and on an on-going basis, the ability of Labs to perform protocol-specified pharmacology assays correctly and reliably. The CPQA will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids/networks/pages/daidsnetworks.aspx).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to expand the number of clinical pharmacology laboratories serviced by the CPQA during the course of the contract. Increases in effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide programs to assure the quality of the development of clinical pharmacology resources, the conduct of pharmacology activities at DAIDS-funded clinical trial research laboratories and pharmacology laboratories, the reporting of pharmacology-specific data from these DAIDS-funded entities, and disseminate assessment of trial outcomes, guidance, and strategies for quality improvement. The Contractor shall provide support to: (1) evaluate the ability of Labs to accurately and reliably perform study-specified pharmacology assays; (2) plan and conduct of single and multi-Lab studies for the development, validation and implementation of bioanalytical methods for measuring drug concentrations in study specimens; (3) acquire, characterize, store, and distribute to Labs quality control materials and reagents; (4) guide and assist Lab and clinical site staff in proficiency testing, assay validation and in the conduct of clinical pharmacology studies; and (5) prepare Labs for FDA inspections and study audits.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>1. Monitoring performance of laboratories ability to accurately and reliably perform pharmacology assays (e.g., HPLC-MS, UPLC-MS, HPLC-UV). This shall include design of proficiency testing (PT) programs, preparation of PT panels, capture and statistical analysis of test results, assessment of lab's testing performance, generation of Lab-specific performance report, and provision of remediation samples for re-testing.</p>
<p>2. Supporting and facilitating pharmacology assay development, validation, and implementation conducted by the Labs. This shall include development assays for novel biomatrices, new drugs and drug metabolites; review and evaluation of assay validation reports (AVR) and AVR SOPs, and development of procedures that refine sampling process, sample processing and storage.<br /><br />3. Acquiring, characterizing, storing, documenting, and disbursing analytical grade reference standards (AGRS)/reference drug powder and other reagents needed for the preparation of quality control samples for method development and validation studies and for proficiency testing panels; disbursing AGRS/reference drug powder and QC samples to laboratories.</p>
<p>4. Assisting and guiding laboratories staff in corrective action when testing proficiency is not acceptable. Assisting and guiding laboratories in procedures and SOPs in performing pharmacology assays and conducting clinical pharmacology studies; providing guidance, via on-line tutorial, to clinical site staff, for PK/PD studies, and for sample collection, processing and storage.</p>
<p>5. Preparing laboratories for FDA laboratory inspections and study audits via conducting on-site lab inspection and study-specific audit that assess lab's overall quality of operations, quality planning and quality improvement (pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical); reporting the findings and deviations, and interacting closely with the Lab to take corrective actions for errors that matters.</p>
<p>6. Obtaining quality control materials (QCMs) needed for the preparation of quality control samples for assay development and validation and drug panels for pharmacology proficiency testing. Examples of QCMs include antiretroviral (e.g., nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, and CCR5 inhibitors) and anti-tuberculosis, and anti-HCV drugs.</p>
<p>7. Hosting and maintaining an existing CPQA computerized data management system to track and make available documents in support of activities performed under the Statement of Work of the contract. The contractor must have the ability to maintain the computerized system security documentation as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).</p>
<p>8. Disseminating CPQA technical and scientific data.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to plan for and implement the Initial, at the beginning of the contract, and Final Transitions at the end of the contract. The Contractor will be expected to have experience and expertise to carry out a project of this size and complexity, must understand technical and regulatory issues relevant to resource-constrained countries, and must have the flexibility to address emerging needs and expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about March 1, 2015. The requirement will be for the delivery of 8.85 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>

Main Street B-202, Memphis, TN 38103 no later than 4:00 p.m. central standard time December 17, 2013. NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.   <br>  <br> Performance Work Statement (PWS):  <br>  <br> 1.0   General information and Background <br>  <br> 1.1	The work required by this contract includes furnishing all labor, management, transportation, supplies, planting stock, storage facilities and equipment for plot expansion, seed harvesting, seed testing, restoration experiments and prairie restoration for the Grand Prairie Area Demonstration Project (GPADP) - Bayou Meto Basin Element. <br> 1.2	The GPADP - Bayou Meto Basin Element is within a region that historically contained 400,000 acres of tall-grass prairie.  To help recreate the native prairie ecosystem, restoration of native prairie will be a major environmental feature of both projects.  Prairie restoration efforts will focus on the establishment of the four grasses that historically dominated the Grand Prairie region: big bluestem, little bluestem, indiangrass, and switchgrass.  A study by Southern Illinois University at Carbondale provides evidence that local prairie grasses are genetically different from commercially available grasses.  Therefore, seeds from local populations of prairie grasses will be used for planting to restore genotypes that evolved specifically within the Grand Prairie region as a result of many years of geographic isolation. <br> 1.3	The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) has collected seeds from local prairie remnants; established single-species plots of the four dominant grasses at its experimental farm in Lonoke, Arkansas; harvested seeds from established seed-production plots and local prairie remnants; and conducted viability and germination tests on harvested seeds. UAPB production fields have plots dedicated to each of the four major species to be produced by this project: switchgrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, and indiangrass.  UAPB also maintains mixed-species prairie grass plots at the Lonoke farm. <br>  <br> 2	Performance Work Statement. <br>  <br> 2.1	All of the Contractor plots covered by this contract will be used as seed sources during prairie grass restoration efforts to insure that an adequate supply of seeds is available during construction of the GPADP.  Also, experimental plantings of prairie grasses must be conducted in order to determine the best method(s) for restoring prairie grasses on irrigation canals and reservoir levees.  UAPB will also utilize their Small Farm Outreach Program to begin to establish a seed production program with private landowners. Contractor will be responsible for planting the harvested seeds on 62 acres of completed canals and levees and also on 50 acres of upland prairie, as part of the restoration efforts for the GPADP. <br> 2.2	During the growing seasons of 2012 through 2016, existing seed-production plots will be cultivated, weeded (both mechanically and with herbicide), fertilized and irrigated to achieve maximum survival and production. <br> 2.3	During each September, October, and November UAPB will harvest seed from the production plots and local prairie remnants, determine quantities, and store seeds in a cool (30-40 degrees F), dry environment. From December to February, seeds from production plots and existing prairies will be tested for viability and germination rate. <br> 2.4	During each fall and spring, experimental plantings of various prairie grasses will be conducted at Contractor's Lonoke farm to determine the best method(s) for restoring native upland and wetland prairie.  In addition, control plantings of other grasses will be made in order to compare the soil retention properties of prairie grasses to other species. <br> 2.5	The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Memphis District shall have exclusive rights to the use of all prairie grass seeds collected from UAPB and private landowner seed-production plots established under this contract or collected from existing prairie remnants under this contract until construction of the GPADP, including all environmental features, has been completed. <br>  <br> 3	Care, handling and Storage of Collected Seeds <br>  <br> 3.1	The Contractor shall provide adequate storage of seeds from the time collected until the time the seeds are in the care of the Government or replanted. Care, handling and storage of collected seed shall be in a manner best suited for the type of seeds based on research of the contractor. Seeds shall normally store seeds in a cool (30-40 degrees F), dry environment.

INVITATION FOR OFFER  FEDERAL CRUDE CONSERVATION HELIUM
IFO NO. BLM-2014-OMCHS-001
January 2014  June 2014
Introduction
The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 (HSA), 50 U.S.C.  167-167q, was enacted on October 2, 2013. The purpose of this Invitation for Offer (IFO) is to implement 167d(a) of the HSA, Phase A: Allocation Transition, which applies beginning October 2, 2013, and ending on September 30, 2014; and during any period which the sale of helium under 50 U.S.C.  167d(b), Phase B: Auction implementation, is delayed or suspended.  During Phase A, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) shall offer crude helium for sale in such quantities, at such times, at not less than the minimum prices established under  167d(b)(7), and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out Phase A with minimum market disruption.  In order to minimize market disruption, the BLM has determined to offer for sale a portion of the Federal Helium Reserve stored in the Cliffside Field, north of Amarillo Texas. 
Phase A sales will be conducted in a manner intended to minimize market disruptions including, pure helium market disruptions for end users; shortages of crude helium to pure helium refiners; or an oversupply of crude helium on the market for crude helium extractors.  
The volume of helium available for this sale is 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) at a price of $95 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) at 14.65 psi and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For more details and all documentation required to be sent with offer please see Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Amarillo Field Offices website @ http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/fo/Amarillo_Field_Office.html

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source".&nbsp;
<p>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the International Trade Administration, plans to award a bridge contract on a sole source basis. <br /> <br />The contract period shall be from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. Awarding a contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays/gaps in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract. It is the Government's intent to compete and award a new contract within the twelve (12) month period of performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541511 with the Size Standard of $25.5 million.<br /><br />The International Trade Administration (ITA) proposes to contract with Aplicor to support the Client Tracking System (CTS).  The purpose of this system is to provide ITA with a central common database and tools for managing all interactions with its clients.  This software package has several modules that support different applications. The CTS product is developed and licensed (including all supporting modules and components) by Aplicor. Aplicor holds proprietary rights to the Aplicor CTS product and is the exclusive support services provider for the product.<br /><br />This contract will be awarded as new short-term "bridge" contract with the incumbent contractor, Aplicor 1515 South Federal Highway - Suite 306, Boca Raton, Florida 33432 USA. There will be no change to the existing specifications or service requirements.<br /><br />The proposed bridge contract will be for a maximum period of 12 months (including options). This will provide for continuation of current services while the follow-on requirement is solicited and awarded on a competitive basis. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE AND TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.<br /><br />ANY RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE MUST SHOW CLEAR, COMPELLING, AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT COMPETITION WILL BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT. IF NO AFFIRMATIVE WRITTEN RESPONSE IS RECEIVED, THE CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE. A DETERMINATION NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, National Severe Storms Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vaisala Inc, of Louisville, CO, for the purchase of a RFP-900 signal processor.<br /><br />***The sole source determination is based on the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) requirement to upgrade the current RVP-8 signal processor in the mobile dual polarized X-band Doppler radar system; NOXP. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>RVP-8, manufactured by Vaisala, is the primary controller, data acquisition and signal processing equipment in the radar. It is used in all NWS's WSR-88D and many FAA's radar systems. RVP-8 is rapidly approaching end-of-life. Vaisala no longer manufactures or sells the RVP-8 and support will cease December of 2015. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Upgrading to the RVP-900 will allow the NSSL to transfer their IRIS Radar and IRIS Analysis software licenses to the new platform resulting in savings of significant software costs. In addition many other hardware and software components developed over the years will be directly ported to the RVP-900 resulting in significant additional savings. RVP-8 and RVP-900 are solely manufactured and sold by Vaisala. There are no known manufacturers with compatible hardware and software. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Delivery date shall be 30 days after award.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, firms that believe <span style="BACKGROUND: #ffff99">they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation</span> in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The objectives of this effort are to raise the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of SWIR Camera technology to a level high enough to make it ready for widespread program insertion and acquisition; to increase the device performance while reducing the cost to less than $5000 per item (not including optics); and to expand manufacturing capabilities so the SWIR technology can be more responsive to the needs of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies, their customers and the defense industrial base. Subsequently, this effort seeks to establish a merchant supplier base for not only the camera cores but sensors, packaged and unpackaged focal plane arrays, wafers and other associated components of SWIR sensor technology to allow for other companies to be able to realize different form factors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Hood (MICC-FH) intends to award a sole source CPFF contract under the authority of 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) to Inter-Coastal Electronics Inc.(ICE), to provide support of the Attack Helicopter (AH)-64E Follow on Test (FOT) I with software, hardware, instrumentation certification, simulation Verification and Validation, event  operation support, Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA), and data delivery.  The Longbow Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) for AH-64E will be used with Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) systems and other Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) systems to provide an RTCA suite for the AH-64 E Follow on Test (FOT) I to be conducted by the United States Army Operational Test Command (USAOTC) Aviation Test Directorate (AVTD). This contract will provide for hardware upgrade/modification of 4 aircraft TESS units and 70 ground equipment TESS units plus on-site support during the test for operation, maintenance and data download for these units. Inter-Coastal Electronics Inc. is the only manufacturer of the AH-64 Tactical Engagement Simulation System (AH-64 TESS) which is essential in integrating the MILES and RTCA systems. The Government does not have the software data package to include licenses and source codes. Without the licensing and source code the vendor cannot accomplish the work required to upgrade or modify the TESS software as needed by the Government. In addition, the Government does not own the technical data package for the TESS hardware. A vendor, without a technical package (drawings, schematics, etc), will encounter significant difficulties in accomplishing the hardware changes required by the required delivery date of 30 April 2014. To award to a contractor other than ICE would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government as well as cause delays in testing requirements of OTC-AVTD. The anticipated award date is 31 Jan 2014.  This projected award date is based on the following milestones: TESS hardware and software upgrade/modification completion no later than 30 Apr 14 and completion of Air worthiness, aircraft certification, and TESS instrumentation verification and validation no later than 18 Jul 14 to support a test start date of 4 Aug 14. The contractor shall also provide on-site support at the test site at Eglin AFB, FL to include, but not limited to: instrumentation installation; maintenance; operational support for TESS, ground RTCA instrumentation, watercraft RTCA instrumentation, link-16 taps, and Common Operating Picture displays during test preparation, test execution, and Post Test Data Review; and collect, inspect, order, and deliver instrumentation test data, collected, and produced by TESS and RTCA systems. <br> Total estimated cost for this effort is approximately $1.4M. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330 with a small business size standard of $14.0M. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this synopsis. All respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number.  All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to the Government point of contact for this announcement, denitra.i.foy.civ@mail.mil or theodore.n.panknin.civ@mail.mil. The Government will not accept telephonic inquiries or responses.   <br>

<p>Contractors are sought to help fill the difficult gaps in the ER schedule. They are often put on the schedule for nights, weekends, holidays, and are often grouped into several shifts when needed during a short period of time. Sometimes, they are not scheduled for an extended period of time to ensure the other permanent doctors get enough shifts for their any -80- requirements. Sometimes, there is a need of several shifts to be filled within a short period of time. Even though not convenient, they frequently have to cover single shifts when needed. This can result in significant expense for those traveling a long distance, but cannot always be avoided. We aim to group shifts into at least two days in a row, but often that cannot be arranged. Contractors could have single shifts far apart from any other shift.</p>

<p>On the average, there will be 4 ten-hour shifts per pay period (two weeks), but that is only an average. This can vary greatly, depending on everyones schedule and availability.</p>
<p>Schedule dates are forthcoming and will be emailed to requesting agencies.</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<DESC>Background/Introduction 

The Office of Naval Research (ONR Code 322MS) has provided the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Physics Department with a fleet (8 total) of autonomous underwater gliders.  ONR has also provided NPS with several new and advanced underwater acoustic and environmental sensors.  ONR-322MS has tasked NPS with the management of these systems and the integration of these various sensors into these platforms for research and operational opportunities.  However, the skill sets required to design and integrate the hardware and software necessary to complete this tasking does not reside at NPS.  

Scope 

The work includes the following major elements:
	Design, build, test, and integrate the hardware for the data acquisition (DAQ) system, and the software which is needed to run the hardware.
 The hardware will be COTS hardware from various vendors (e.g., PC104 computer board, A2D converters, GPS synchronized 10MHz oscillator), the combination of which is expected to be designed by the vendor but will be purchased by NPS.  This will form the total hardware package of the DAQ system. Real-time embedded software and hardware control will need to be developed by the vendor.  
	Design, create, test, and integrate the software which is needed to collect data from environmental sensors (AML Oceanographic SmartX sensors). The hardware will be acquired by NPS, while the vendor must develop the real-time embedded software and hardware control to extract the sensors data into the DAQ.
	Technical support during sea-trials of the glider.

<p>Submission of Quotation: Your quotation in response to RFQ0106-14 is due December 30, 2013, 2:00 p.m. ET. The mailing address is as follows: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Acquisitions Services Division, 131 M Street, N.E., Room 4SW26D, Washington, D.C. 20507 Attn: Gregory Browne; Contracting Officer. A quotation submitted via e-mail addressed to gregory.browne@eeoc.gov with a cc: copy to anthony.price@eeoc.gov will be accepted. Questions regarding this request for quotation should be submitted to Gregory Browne, via e-mail at gregory.browne@eeoc.gov. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. The deadline for submission of questions regarding RFQ0106-14 is December 16, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. ET. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before February 28, 2014.<br />Basis for Award: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. Additionally, risk ratings will be conducted to assess the risks and weaknesses associated with each quoter's proposed approach to performing the above mentioned requirements. It is an overall assessment derived from the technical evaluation and is driven by each of the sub-factors within the technical factor. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated Price. The Government reserves the right to make an award to the quoter with the highest technically rated quotation rather than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that the quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as equal, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor. <br />The sub-factors for technical evaluation are listed below in descending order of importance: <br />Technical Capability: On-line Appointment Scheduling Tool Requirements and Software as-a-Service<br />Technical Capability: Technical Approach &amp; Methodology<br />Past Performance<br />Factor I - Technical Capabillity: The technical quotation should be directly responsive to the above mentioned requirements, and Appendix A. The quoter should set forth in detail, the overall technical approach and capabilities for accomplishing the required work. These will be an important factor in selection of the contractor, and should be specific and complete. The quoter should present the information necessary to provide a basis for evaluation by the Government of the quoter's technical qualifications and the proposed solution to the technical problems.<br />Each quotation will be evaluated in the light of the material and substantiating evidence presented in the quotation and not on the basis of what is inferred. The quotation should not simply repeat the RFQ.</p>
<p>Each quotation should include a completed Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) to describe how Section 508 standards are met (See Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards). Volume I shall not exceed 30 pages.<br />The quoter shall be available to provide a demonstration of approximately one-hour in length of how their proposed product meets the requirements.<br />i. The demonstration should last approximately one hour. An appropriate amount of time will be allowed prior to the demo to set up, and following the demo to finish answering questions related to the functionality and requirements.<br />ii.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OFDA provides non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  The Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team (HPGE) serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement and institutional relationships with international organizations and other donor governments.  HPGE tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action to DCHA; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with implementing partners; leads OFDA's communications and social media outreach; and serves as the primary interlocutor on strategic issues with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues.<br /> <br />The Program Team Leader position serves as an integral part of the HPGE team and closely coordinates with other parts of the U.S. Government (USG) community on humanitarian issues.  The position assists in planning DCHA strategies and global program responses to humanitarian crises; leads efforts to strengthen institutional relationships with international organizations, non-governmental organizations and think tanks, has oversight for a multi-million dollar program portfolio in funding to international organizations, and manages the program team.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Program Team Leader in order to meet its objectives of programming, coordinating with other donors, and managing institutional relationships with partner organizations.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Program Team Leader provides critical analysis on programming with international organizations, policy issues pertaining to legislation and programming, works closely with high-ranking officials within the international community, serves as a key source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian programming for international organizations within the office, and manages a program team.  He/She will help plan organizational strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively work with other members of DCHA Bureau, international organizations and donor governments to coordinate programming strategies, provide effective liaison with the response divisions, and anticipate and prepare documents and briefing memos on humanitarian issues for important meetings and events.</p>
<p>The Program Team Leader would manage administration of a diverse multi-million dollar portfolio of globally-funded OFDA programs, many of which are implemented by UN agencies and public IOs.  In addition to managing a discrete portfolio, the Program Team Leader would also be expected to provide critical guidance on OFDA's relationship with public IOs, as well as guidance on internal USAID regulations and policies impacting these relationships.</p>
<p>The Program Team Leader will also manage critical issues with the UN and NGO community on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices, and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and must have the ability to multi-task.  The assignment requires providing expert analytical and advisory support on a wide range of humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy objectives within a broad and complex environment.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data and the Program Team Leader will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in IOs and other agencies, experts, and senior representatives of NGOs.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington. Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Program Team Leader may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. A-E firms will be selected from this announcement based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.<br />Up to four (4) Indefinite Delivery Contract will be negotiated and awarded. At least one (1) award will be to a small business.</p>
<p>The length of each contract length is a maximum of 60-months and will not include option periods. The contract amount will not exceed $5,000,000 (EFARS 36.601-3-90(b)). The Government shall be under no obligation to issue any particular number or types of orders and no liability to the contractor shall be incurred in the event that a certain number or types of orders are not issued: however, the Government guarantees a minimum ordering obligation as $35,000 for the basic contract (NOTE: This is a minimum ordering obligation: NOT a minimum payment. The contractor shall only be entitled to breach of contract damages, i.e., anticipated profit for an order of this amount and provable standby costs in the event that the Government does not issue orders for the value of the minimum-ordering guarantee.)</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders and will be negotiated and issued under the terms and conditions of this Indefinite Delivery Contract.</p>
<p>Labor rates for each discipline, overhead rates and escalation factors for each calendar year will be negotiated in the basic contract. Escalation factors will be negotiated and applied to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th 5th calendar years of the contract.</p>
<p>Work distribution between IDCs: Task Orders (TO) will be distributed according to the experience and qualifications of the A-E firms. Task Orders will be competed amongst the four selectees. The specific contractor chosen for a TO will be selected based on factors such as technical expertise, demonstrated performance, specific ability, TO size and complexity, and contractor availability to complete the TO in the time required. We are going to have the A-E firms to compete amongst the highly qualified selectees for this contract. Above all, it is the intent of the New York District to not have a "hollow" contract.</p>
<p>The approximate award date of each contract is December 2013. The wages and benefits of service employees (see Far 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not of the location of the work). To be eligible for a contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This contract consists of a full range of surveying and mapping services within the North Atlantic Division. Hydrographic surveys will constitute approximately 80% of all work orders.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment VA101-14-Q-0023 A00002 is to answer to additional questions as provided below.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged and in full effect.  

1.	The Grand Total CLIN is confusing.  It is asking for us to add unit pricing for four line items.  Should it be the total and you will then compute an average unit price over the four years?

a.	No.  Unit pricing, annual totals, and grand totals should be provided separately.  Clarification of the pricing proposal structure:
i.	Each individual Item should state the unit price for the low- and the high-quantity rates;
ii.	Each low-quantity annual total amount should consist of a total derived by multiplying the low-quantity rate by the maximum quantity stated;
iii.	Each high-quantity annual total amount should consist of a total derived by multiplying the high-quantity rate by the maximum quantity stated;
iv.	The low-quantity grand total is calculated by adding all annual low-quantity totals;
v.	The high-quantity grand total is calculated by adding all annual high-quantity totals;

OVERVIEW     <br>          <br>     The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.      <br>          <br>     The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).     <br>          <br>     2.  REQUIREMENTS     <br>          <br>     The basic technical requirements are divided into categories to enable companies that have solutions in a particular field(s) to provide informational responses on their area of expertise.     <br>          <br>     2.1.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command , Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of PM-Force Sustainment Systems for the Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System Light and Heavy (ALVADS-L/H).  The intent of the ALVADS-L/H program is to identify a new parachute which will replace the G-11 cargo parachute and will ensure load survivability at lower altitudes while being more cost effective than the G-11 over its lifecycle.  The Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System's (ALVADS) is a suite of options when distribution of supplies and equipment is required by aerial delivery.  ALVADS consists of five components:  Component I - ALVADS Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS), Component II - ALVADS Light, Component III - ALVADS Heavy, Component IV - ALVADS Advanced Cargo Parachute Release System (ACPRS), and Component V - ALVADS Rapid Rigging and De-rigging Airdrop System (RRDAS).  Component I ALVADS EPJS has already achieved a MS C Decision and has been initially fielded.  Component IV ALVADS ACPRS is currently pursuing a MS C, Type Classification and Full Materiel Release Decision.  Based on the US Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) priorities list for ALVADS and the recent decision to combine the Light and Heavy requirements, ALVADS Light/Heavy capability is the next priority.  The Government anticipates awarding several Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the base effort with a down select to one for the remaining portion of the contract.  Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders and not by the basic contract.  The contract guaranteed minimum is $80,000.00.  The contract maximum shall not exceed $15,000,000.00.  Market Research has been conducted by technical experts, and has shown that this requirement will be procured under Full and Open Competition.

January 2014 - June 2014
Introduction:
The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 (HSA), 50 U.S.C.  167-167q, was enacted on October 2, 2013. The purpose of this Invitation for Offer (IFO) is to implement 167d(a) of the HSA, Phase A: Allocation Transition, which applies beginning October 2, 2013, and ending on September 30, 2014; and during any period which the sale of helium under 50 U.S.C.  167d(b), Phase B: Auction implementation, is delayed or suspended.  During Phase A, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) shall offer crude helium for sale in such quantities, at such times, at not less than the minimum prices established under  167d(b)(7), and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out Phase A with minimum market disruption.  In order to minimize market disruption, the BLM has determined to offer for sale a portion of the Federal Helium Reserve stored in the Cliffside Field, north of Amarillo Texas. 
Phase A sales will be conducted in a manner intended to minimize market disruptions including, pure helium market disruptions for end users; shortages of crude helium to pure helium refiners; or an oversupply of crude helium on the market for crude helium extractors.  
The volume of helium available for this sale is 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) at a price of $95 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) at 14.65 psi and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For more details and all documentation required to be sent with offer please see Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Amarillo Field Office's website at  http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/fo/Amarillo_Field_Office.html

<DESC>Modification A00001 extends the response date to 12/18/2013 at 3:00 PM&nbsp;EST.<br /><br />**************************************************************&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine if there are two (2) or more capable Small Businesses that can perform the requirements of the planned contract (base and four (4) option years). For this reason, it is vitally important for Small Businesses to respond to this announcement with highly effective Capability Statements.
<p>Interested firms with capabilities of providing the required services are requested to submit a Capability Statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside in full or in part. The intended procurement will be classified under the North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 611710: Educational Support Services (Educational Testing Services) with a size standard of $14M. All respondents are required to identify their firm's size and type of business.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, is the coordinator within the Federal Government for a wide range of emergency management activities. FEMA is dedicated to working closely with all levels and branches of government, as well as related organizations of the emergency management community to achieve a realistic state of preparedness and an increased capacity to mitigate against, respond to and recover from emergencies of all types.</p>
<p>The agency has numerous roles, including: coordinating government activities; providing planning, grants and technical assistance; guiding and advising various agencies; and delivering training.</p>
<p>FEMA's Emergency Management Institute (EMI) provides both training and technical assistance to State, tribal and local jurisdictions as well as our Federal partners, other government agencies, and associated organizations such as the American Red Cross on a wide variety of topics related to emergency management.</p>
<p>EMI's Independent Study (IS) Program uses alternate delivery formats to provide emergency management training to State, tribal and local officials, Federal partners, and associated organizations in emergency management communities. This program provides free on-demand training that is available through print copy, downloadable format from the Web, or Web interactive and may include CD-ROM, DVD and video materials. There are currently approximately 100 accredited courses through the current contract. These courses result in a combined average annual number of course completions at approximately two-four million. An additional 50 courses are projected to be added to the program annually and will require review for accreditation. It is also projected that approximately 50 existing courses will be revised and will require review for accreditation.</p>
<p>The IS curriculum is increasing and expanding to include additional independent study/self study courses from EMI. The total enrollments fluctuate between two-four million (with approximately three million active student records managed per year).</p>
<p>Receipt, warehousing, inventory, and distribution of IS course materials are conducted by the FEMA Warehouse.</p>
<p>New independent study courses are developed under separate contract(s) and/or Government employees. These courses are submitted to the independent study program contractor for enrollment and student record keeping. This contract does not include development of any independent study courses.</p>
<p>The Capability Statement shall succinctly address the following three items to demonstrate the contractor's capability to perform the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) (attached):<br />(1) The contractor's ability to manage, as prime contractor, the types and magnitude of<br />tasking in the PWS; and<br />(2) The contractor's technical ability, or potential approach to achieving technical ability, to<br />perform at least 50% of the cost of the contract for personnel with its own employees; and<br />(3) The contractor's capacity, or potential approach to achieving capacity, to conduct the<br />requirements of the PWS. For the purposes of this Capability Statement, capacity shall refer<br />to matters such as the magnitude of the tasking, the amount of equipment or facilities<br />involved, and the size of the staff needed. <br />(4) Demonstrated ability to manage, technical ability and capacity includes citing and<br />describing the same or similar relevant performance.</p>
<p>The Capability Statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the following: your ability to manage, technical ability and capacity to meet requirements above. The Capability Statement shall not exceed ten (10) single sided single spaced pages of a font size no smaller than 12 point. The Capability Statement should have attached a minimum of three (3) business references with current contact information (email and phone number) relevant to the primary functions of this requirement as described in the PWS.</p>
<p>Please email your Capability Statement to Laura Harshbarger (laura.harshbarger@fema.dhs.gov) and Gary Topper (gary.topper@fema.dhs.gov) by no later than the close of business (3:00 pm local Washington, DC time) on December 12, 2013.</p>
<p>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation nor will the Government pay for the information requested.</p>

Recap of Purpose of RFI Survey for Vendor Capabilities and Vendor Comments
The RFI has been issued to survey vendor capabilities and comments regarding the Governments potential requirement for hardware and software maintenance for telephony nodes at various locations throughout the United States. The requirement is for a Contractor (either alone or with a subcontracting and/or teaming arrangement), to provide the following:
1.	24/7 hardware and software maintenance coverage during system failures. The requirement also requires a 24 hour toll free number where the operator can dispatch a certified technician who will respond and be on-site within four hours if the issue cannot be resolved remotely.
2.	On-site maintenance support at its OCIO Denver location. The intent is to provide on-site technical support for the daily operation of Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise (OXE) Telephony system and Genesys & OmniTouch Contact Center applications and AVST CX-E Voice Mail System. The requirement is to have a certified technician on-site during core business hours to perform high-level troubleshooting as well as move-adds-changes (MAC).
3.	A Certified Genesys Administrator is anticipated. The Administrator will be responsible for the full system administration of the Genesys product suite of components. The Administrator may be remote or onsite at the OCIO Denver or Washington D.C. area location.  DOI reserves the right to change location in the future.
4.	Installation of telephony hardware and software in the event of failure, normal wear and tear, or the addition of a new site to the IDVC.

The company must supply separate submission(s) for each area.    <br>      <br>  MODIFICATION:  <br>  Questions and Answers for synopsis requirements W912L7-14-R-0001:   <br>  Question 1: In the synopsis of Solicitations W9122L7-14-R-0001 and W912L7-14-R-0001 for the Tennessee National Guard that  quote mark there will be no travel paid on any of the resulting task orders. quote mark   Could you please clarify  quote mark travel quote mark  for me?  I would assume that this would refer at least to lodging and per diem, but does it also include vehicle/gas costs?  <br>  Answer 1. First the Synopsis W9122L7-14-R-0001 is cancelled. Use the W912L7-14-R-0001, it is a correct one.    <br>  Second, the travel cost will be in your burdened rate(s) there will not be any travel paid. This is a directive from the PARCs office so this is not subject to change. Let me say this though, in very special cases that the Contracting Officer approves and with funding travel could be paid. Expect that there will be no funding allowed. Budgets are getting tighter so this request is for A&Es in the state to eliminate costs.   <br>  Question 2: The synopsis contains the following under the section for Selection Criteria: Section (4) PAST PERFORMANCE on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. List, but do not submit, no more than five (5) actual copies of recent awards, commendations or other superior performance indicators.  <br>  It appears that there is a conflict within the second sentence since it indicates  quote mark List, but do not submit, no more than five (5) actual copies quote mark  of awards.  Will you clarify if you are seeking a listing of awards or if you want copies of awards?  If copies of awards are sought, are the copies in addition to the listed page limit?  If you want a listing of awards, will you define the level of detail you are seeking regards to the award?   <br>  Answer 2: The  quote mark List quote mark  means submit the project information you want us to know about, but do not submit the actual contract please. List the appropriate information: contract number, DoD project name, what was the project,  the degree of work performed, period of performance, degree of difficulty and complexity, did the project come in for the estimated amount, etcetera. The requirement is for 2 copies of your submittals per area, but some wish to add more. Don't exceed 5 copies. Yes this is part of your 20 pages.  The clarification of 20 pages: one page has a front and a back. You may use both but don't exceed 20 pages. The 254 is not part of the page count. See Question 3 for more on 254s.    <br>  There was ambiguity with the word  quote mark award quote mark : This term means accolade to a civilian but to contracting an award is a contract. Since there was more than one question on this concept the decision is it can mean both. But use Caution; past performance is the heading of the section so we are asking for descriptions on actual work performed. Stating only awards (accolade) with no project information would not be complete.      <br>  Question 3: Does DD254 DOD Contract Security Classification Specification get submitted? Is this form done by the Government?  <br>  Answer 3: Yes, we want a DD254 on all the prime people in the submission. THIS IS NOT PART OF THE PAGE REQUIREMENT.  There may be some work requirements that require higher degree of security by the Architects and Engineers.  We are asking for the prime to be knowledgeable about the form. We know there is no project information at this point. Future projects may require all parties on a project to have this completed and passed prior to performance. Anyone who could not pass the security check(s) would not be able to perform on the project and could affect award of a task order.  The government would help process the form but the A&E employees and subcontractors would fill in a majority of the information.   <br>  Question 4: Can the four contract vehicles be used by other DoD entities within the state such as the Navy or Corps?    <br>  Answer 4: I don't believe any non DOD entities will be utilizing our contracts. No requests have been made of us so far.  If that were a future need it will be discussed with any of the awardees at that time and would be considered a special circumstance.   <br>  Question 5: Is this contract requiring 100 % utilization within the State exclusive to only TN Air and Army NG activities?    <br>  Question 5: Four contracts will be awarded. Submit for each area you wish to perform services. The areas are labeled: Army, Knoxville, Memphis, and Nashville. LABEL each submission by the area.    <br>  Question 6: Does each of the 3 geographic areas represent the ANG work and Army represents statewide Army NG work?  <br>  Answer 6: This is a description of area as a general rule, but a contracting officer decides who receives award of a task order.     <br>  Question 7: Will there be four separate COTRs, one for each contract vehicle?   <br>  Answer 7: We use the acronym COR, contracting officer's representative, they are all skilled technically. The answer to the question is no. there are more than four CORs. Your contact for this synopsis and in the event you receive an award will be Terri Baxter unless otherwise notified.   <br>  Question 8: Are the awards to be only to one AE firm, exclusively, as opposed to a mix and match of the four finalists?  <br>  Answer 8: We can have one to four contractors. The A&E who applies for multiple areas would need to explain how they intend to meet all the requirements simultaneously and for a long term basis.   <br>  Question 9: Clarification: is the $10M cumulative for all four contracts? Or is $10M per each of four contract vehicles?   <br>  Answer 9: Each award is $10Million. Even if one contractor received award for all the areas they would have four separate awards which would then total $40 Million. Multiple submissions require explanation of how the contractor will meet expectations of all requirements simultaneously and for a long term basis.   <br>  Question 10: The referenced RFQ states that the Small Business size standard is $14.0 million for NAICS 541330, which applies to Engineering Firms.  If an architectural firm was to be prime, would the same $14.0 million threshold apply for a small business, or would architects still fall under NAICS 541310, which is $7.0 million? Both NAICS codes are referenced in the RFQ?  <br>  Answer 10: First, this is NOT an RFQ or an RFP. This is a synopsis; a request for submissions to be vetted to the next part of the process. The highest rated contractors will be asked to be interviewed. The successful contractor(s) will receive a solicitation to provide more information which includes burdened pricing rates, G&A, profit, etcetera.   <br>   Second, the NAIC code is for the prime contractor submitting. This request is unrestricted which means large and small companies may apply. Architect and Engineering services are important but only one NAICs code can be input.  The requirement states NAICS 541310 which will be verified in SAM for each contractor, https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  Note that the Prime contractor that receives an award will have reporting requirements of subcontractors.   <br>  Question 11: Will a DD Form 254 form be required for each subcontractor?  Some of our subs are small business firms and may have trouble acquiring certification.   <br>  Answer 11: The DD Form 254 form is not required for this submission. But the contractors/subcontractors that have trouble could have an effect a future award of a task order with security requirements. See Question 2 & 3 for more about  quote mark 254 quote mark  information.  <br>  Question 12: The Fed Biz Ops announcement for this opportunity has two different due dates: Dec 20 and Dec 18, 2013. Can you please confirm which date is correct?  <br>  Answer 12: There were two synopsis posted.  The first is W9122L7-14-R-0001 and the second is W912L7-14-R-0001.  The synopsis with the extra 2 is cancelled.  The due date for submissions on the correct synopsis, numbered W912L7-14-R-0001, is changed to December 20, 2013.   <br>  Question 13: Can you please clarify  quote mark presolicitation quote mark  phase?    <br>  Answer 13: See Question and answer number 10.   <br>  Question 14: Is a 10 pitch font required?  It is our understanding that this is a very large font.  Typical SF330 submittals are 10 point fonts.  <br>  Answer 14: For this synopsis, pitch references font size. The font size required is 10.   <br>  Question 15: Can an engineering company with a primary NAICS code of 541330 submit a proposal on this solicitation as they will have a sub with the NAICS code of 541310. And the SAM profile will include both NAICS codes. Please clarify.  <br>  Answer 15: As long as the NAICs code is on the Prime contractors SAM report you have met the requirement.  <br>  Question 16: Is this a new requirement or a follow-on effort? If this is a follow-on, would you please provide the incumbent contract information?  <br>  Answer 16: This is a new requirement. The requirements have changed but the incumbents are Crump, HFR, and C2RL.  No fourth contract for  quote mark Army quote mark  was in place.   <br>  End of Questions and Answers for W912L7-14-R-0001.  <br>  <br> Modification# 2 <br> Past performance for A&E projects to be considered is limited to the last 24 months of work. Identify the actual dates of performance when describing the performance. Include the contract number and if the contract was a DoD contract in your description.   <br>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Expressions of Interest Sought</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in San Antonio, TX.</p>
<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding approximately 63,900 rentable square feet (RSF).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Minimum ABOA square feet: 53,500</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maximum ABOA square feet: 55,000</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is for ten years. The space must be available for occupancy by January 2014. The delineated area is North - Callaghan Rd, East - IH-10/ West Interstate 10, South - Vega Drive, West Torino Drive.</p>
<p><br />Other applicable requirements include the following features:</p>
<p>- Proximity to public transportation<br /><br />- Parking [reserved spaces (surface) for official Government vehicles]<br /><br />- Security [lobby, loading dock access, parking, setbacks etc, where and as applicable]</p>
<p><br />The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Dusty Griffith<br />Contracting Officer, Public Buildings Service<br />819 Taylor Street, Room 5A18, Fort Worth, TX 76102<br />817.978.4335<br />dusty.griffith@gsa.gov</p>
<p><br />Expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 p.m. on January 2, 2014 and must include the following information:<br /><br />- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building<br /><br />- Rentable square feet available, and expected fully serviced rental rate per rentable square foot.<br /><br />- ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet to be offered, and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br /><br />- Date of space availability<br /><br />- Building ownership information<br /><br />- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br /><br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building<br /><br />- List of building services provided</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. The authority for negotiating a sole source basis is made under 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 13.106-1 which permits soliciting from a single source, if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available.

<DESC>VISN 5 VA DC 
STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  GENERAL:  This is a non-personal services requirement to provide (a) data analysis and (b) improvement facilitation. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.  Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. 

1.1  Description of Services/Introduction:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform  data analysis and improvement facilitation as defined in this Performance Work Statement  except for those items specified as government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.

1.2 Background:  This request is based on a System Redesign project funded in 2010 and titled "Enhancing the center and culture for performance excellence at the Washington, DC VAMC".    Most of the tasks in this funding initiative have been completed in 2011.  The remaining tasks are the focus on this contract.  

The Washington, DC VA Medical Center (DCVAMC) is committed to being the "Flagship of VA Healthcare."  As the flagship, the medical center is a model site for innovation, continuous quality improvement, and patient safety.  DCVAMC has a systematic approach to improving performance.  Senior leaders regularly review a comprehensive set of performance measures.  In addition to regular Baldridge assessments, a Performance Measure Matrix (PMM) is used to measure and report our ongoing performance of critical processes leading to organizational success.  This also monitors comparisons to VA and non-VA hospitals to monitor targets set by VHA, VISN5 and the facility.  We use these reviews and third party assessments to identify opportunities for improvement.  

The DCVAMC Leadership Team guides the organization, plans for long-term sustainability, ensures effective self-governance, reviews performance, and creates a nurturing culture for operational excellence through the DCVAMC leadership system.  This system focuses on balancing the needs of all stakeholders and establishes the foundation for overall leadership excellence in setting and deploying DCVAMC mission, vision, and values.  Senior leaders serve as strong role models as they implement the leadership system to set organization-wide direction in accordance with the vision, mission and values.

Performance and quality improvement initiatives have been a major focus at the DCVAMC.  Different models of improvement have been tried.  DCVAMC will focus on the Lean model.  The current infrastructure does not fully promulgate effective execution of performance or change activities, resulting in inefficiency of process, delays in organizational learning, and waste of resources.  Although there is currently a Center for Performance Management that exists at the DCVAMC, its ability to enhance organizational performance and promote innovation or creativity is limited due to the lack of availability of dedicated personnel to Lean initiatives and expertise in analysis of large data driven from CPRS.  

As a part of the Patient Flow Collaborative, the DCVAMC was offered the option to participate in the second phase of the Bed Management System (BMS) roll out.  We are currently in the process of planning for the implementation of this new software.  The successful implementation of this software necessitates the redesign of the way we currently coordinate inpatient flow activities.  This is the second area of focus in our proposal.  By developing an Inpatient Center to focus on these activities, the DCVAMC will continue to improve on delivering patient-centered care by focusing on streamlining the admissions through discharge process to serve our Veteran patients better.  

The current VISN 5 network's enabling strategic goal is to deliver world-class service to veterans and their families by applying sound business principles that result in effective management of people, communications, technology, and governance.  This contract for improvement through system redesign and Lean projects will help our facility achieve this strategic goal.  This will be exemplified with the successful implementation of our proposed redesign project.  

1.3 Objectives: The overall strategic plan for further enhancing DCVAMC's commitment to innovative performance improvement activities is divided into two areas:  1) support for enhancing our current Center for Performance Management through analysis of data from CPRS and from Veteran Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), 2) the facilitation of Lean projects to improve care using data available through previous step.

1.4 Scope:  The contractor shall provide two services:  data analysis and improvement facilitation.  These services are described in the following:

"	Data analysis.  The data analysis shall rely on data mining techniques and artificial intelligence for analysis of large massive databases, including text analysis.  The expected number of unique patients to be analyzed is 600,000 cases.  For each patient, 5 years of CPRS data are available.  In addition, many data items, including simple items such as weight are text fields that require complex artificial intelligence techniques for analysis of the data.  In particular, the contractor shall use Guided Bayesian approach described in previous collaboration as their method of analysis.  In conducting these analysis, the contractor shall rely on remote access to the data servers within VA and shall not transfer the data outside of the VA facilities.  This effort will have the following components:
o	Classification of text in Hospice Consults notes within CPRS for patients in DC VA
o	Examination of methods of measuring severity of illness based on claims data and laboratory findings.  
o	Examination of reason for readmission within 30 days.  
o	Examination of trajectory to death for severely ill patients
o	Examination of clinical visits that could have been avoided through telemedicine or other remote contacts
"	Facilitation of Improvement Efforts.  The contract shall use the data analysis accomplished to implement Lean projects within VADCMC.  At a minimum the following efforts will be undertaken:
o	Description of the extent of the problem using patient outcomes.
o	Training of clinicians/managers within VA in Lean improvement efforts.
o	Facilitation of at least 4 Lean improvement projects that examine a clinical decision and design new care protocols that avoid wasted effort and improve patient outcomes.

1.5	Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be for one year.
