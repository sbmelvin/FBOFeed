Introduction
1.1	Purpose

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to (i) consider new and commercially-available technologies and (ii) demonstrate a business case of an information service using these technologies to convey real-time parking availability [Smart Park] to truck drivers 24 hours per day, seven days per week. 

1.2    Overview

One or more offerors may be selected to receive an award (see Section 1.7) to carry out the demonstration project.  FMCSA reserves the right to negotiate the type of award. 
1.2	Background

FMCSA’s mission is to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and motorcoaches.  Its goal is to reduce commercial motor vehicle-related fatalities to 1.65 fatalities per 100 million commercial motor vehicle miles traveled by 2008.  Driver fatigue is a known cause of fatal large truck crashes.  Contributing to fatigue is the lack of safe, available truck parking. 

In 1998, Congress directed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to review causes of truck and bus crashes.  In a 2002 report, NTSB recommended that FMCSA create a guide to inform truck drivers about locations and availability of parking.  Congress further mandated a study on the adequacy of truck parking by the Federal Highway Administration. The 2002 study recommended the deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems to provide commercial motor vehicle drivers with real-time information on the location and availability of parking spaces.  

Before preparing a proposal, prospective offerors should download and read “Intelligent Transportation Systems and Truck Parking”, available at http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safetyprogs/research/researchpubs.htm. They should also read the entire BAA. 
1.3	Offerors

A successful offeror will most likely be a team of three entities:  (i) a truck stop owner/operator (private or public sector), (ii) a government transportation agency (public sector) with jurisdiction over a highway and signage, and (iii) an organization with experience and expertise in parking management technology, including Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) (private or public sector).   

FMCSA encourages service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses.  It also encourages consultation with and/or partnership arrangements among small businesses, truck stop associations, nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations, educational and research institutions, and state and local government agencies.  One partner must serve as lead investigator.  Selected offeror(s) will be announced in fall 2005.  
1.4	Program Scope and Funding

FMCSA may choose to fund an entire proposal or only a portion of a proposal and will not pay for bid and proposal costs.  Total funding for this BAA is not to exceed $2,000,000, subject to availability.  These details do not impose any obligation on FMCSA or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.  FMCSA may incrementally fund any awards under this BAA.
1.5	Period of Performance

The maximum period of performance is approximately 24 months.      
1.6	Independent Evaluation

The U.S. Department of Transportation will conduct an independent evaluation of the project and selected offeror(s) shall cooperate with the independent evaluators to ensure a mutually acceptable, successful evaluation.  
1.7	Type of Award

FMCSA is contemplating a cost-type contract award, but offerors may propose an alternate contract type.
1.8	Point of Contact for Technical Matters: 

Quon Y. Kwan
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (MC-RTT)
	e-mail:  quon.kwan@fmcsa.dot.gov

2	General Information
2.1	Eligibility
	
This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources.  
2.2	Ethical Considerations

Certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees (including special Government employees) may apply.  All facts related to potential or existing conflicts of interest [see Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) section 9.5] must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action taken or proposed to take to avoid or mitigate such conflict.

2.3    Intellectual Property

Intellectual property consists of copyrights, patents, and certain types of databases, software, inventions, training manuals, systems design or other proprietary information in any form or medium.  Intellectual property rights shall be assigned in accord with the FAR:

FAR 52.227-14 (Rights in Data – General)
FAR 52.227-15 (Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software)
FAR 52.227-16 (Additional Data Requirements)

The FAR may be publicly accessed at www.arnet.gov/far/loadmainre.html. 

2.3	Report Requirements  

The number and types of reports and how they should be prepared and submitted will be specified in the award document.  Reports must include, as a minimum, Monthly Technical Progress, Monthly Funds Status, and a Final Report.    

2.4	Required Meetings

Attendance of the key personnel from the selected offeror(s) will be required at:

(i)	One Initial Kick-Off Meeting planned to be in Washington, DC, 30 days after contract award.  
(ii)	Review meetings, held by teleconference every three months.
(iii)	One Final Review/Demonstration meeting planned to be at the offeror’s or demonstration test site.  
2.5	Subcontracting  

Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(d)] requires small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses to be considered fairly as subcontractors to prime contractors under Government contracts.  Prime contractors and subcontractors must carry out this policy of fairness.  An offeror who includes subcontractors (i.e., partners) must submit a subcontracting plan in accord with FAR 19.702(a) (1) and (2).  The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704.  
3	Preparation of Proposal
3.1	Volume I – Technical and Management Approach and Business Case

All proposals will be treated as competitive information and the contents will not be disclosed except for evaluation purposes.  No proposals will be returned.  The original proposal or a copy of such will be retained and all other copies destroyed.  Approximately 30 to 60 days after completing the evaluation, offerors will be notified in writing whether a proposal has been accepted.
3.1.1	Format

Offerors should mark the specific information subject to limited disclosure, as opposed to marking the entire document for limited disclosure.  Avoid markings like “Company Confidential” or other phrases that may be confused with national security classifications.

Ledora Akanni, Contracting Officer
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
Office of Acquisitions Management (MC-MBA)
400 Virginia Ave., SW   3rd floor
Washington, DC  20024

Attn:  DTMC75-05-BAA-00001
4	Evaluation of Proposals
4.1	Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria:  

     a. 	   Technical Approach
     b. 	   Importance to FMCSA Programs 
     c.       Affordability
     d.       Cost Realism 
     e.       Management Team Approach 
     f.        Business Case and Ease of Commercialization/Widespread Deployment.  

The first four criteria (a. through d.) are in accord with FAR 35.016(e). 
4.1.1	Technical Approach  

 	There are two groups of factors that will be considered:  technology-related and test site-related.   The following technology-related factors will be considered:

•	Accuracy of the information on parking availability.
•	Reliability of the technology 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, in all weather conditions.
•	Extent of use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  If equipment is non-COTS, the criterion becomes a matter of how soon the equipment can be made COTS.
•	Conformance with the National ITS Architecture (see www.its.dot.gov/aconform/aconform.htm), any relevant regional architecture, and any standards. 
•	Ease of retrofit into an existing truck parking area.
•	Ability to receive parking availability information in real-time without adding equipment to a truck.
•	Expansion capability so as to provide information on parking availability at nearby truck parking locations.
•	Potential capability to track parking history and make parking reservations.
•	Transferability of the technology to other locations.  
	
The following test-site related factors will be considered:

•	Suitability of proposed test site(s): 
o	Whether there is documentation of (i) complaints about inadequate parking, (ii) need for truck appointment or reservation system, (iii) trucks illegally parked, or (iv) trucks queuing up to enter site(s).
o	Whether the test sites(s) involve at least one private truck stop and at least one public truck stop.	
•	Suitability of the technology for the test site, taking into account conditions such as truck traffic, terrain, and weather.
•	Suitability of the technology for conveying real-time parking information to trucks approaching within (i) 50 miles of, and (ii) one mile of the test site(s).
•	Extent to which proposal identifies risks, consequences, and mitigation. 



	
4.1.2	Importance to FMCSA Programs 

Understanding of the problems of parking availability and getting information on parking to truckers on the road and the relationship of the two problems to the FMCSA mission will be considered.  
4.1.3	Affordability

The proposed total program cost will be evaluated against funds available to determine affordability. 
4.1.4	Cost Realism 

Estimates of the capital costs (including installation) and annual maintenance/ operations costs of the technology will be evaluated as to realism and reasonableness.  Also, proposed total program cost will be evaluated as to realism and reasonableness.   

Cost realism and reasonableness are used to assess understanding of the effort as well as to evaluate the practicality of the technical and management approach. 
4.1.5	Management Team Approach 

The offeror will be evaluated with respect to past performance on government grants or contracts, extent of commitment of partners to the project, and viability of the management approach. 

The range, depth, and mix of expertise of the offeror’s key personnel will be evaluated to ensure they are qualified to carry out the project.   The availability of offeror’s key personnel, facilities, and equipment to this project is also a criterion.  
4.1.6	Business Case and Ease of Commercialization/Widespread Deployment 

The business case will be evaluated to determine sustainability of the technology beyond the demonstration.  In addition, there will be an evaluation of the ease with which the technology can be commercialized and deployed widely.

<CONTACT>Juan Gonzales juan.gonzales@lackland.af.mil
<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don’t intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 – Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238220 with a small business size standard of $12 million.

<DESC>The T-AO 187 Class Fleet Oilers, Henry J. Kaiser Class were built in three (3) flights, with the first vessel delivered in the December 1985 and the last of this class in the November 1995.  The final 3 vessels were delivered with double hull construction.  These vessels were built to ABS Rules and are compliant with commercial Rules and Regulations.  The T-AO vessels are referred to as a Fleet Oilers, but their mission is to support vessels at sea with fuel, food and other staples.  These are transferred while each vessel is underway by a number of means.  The transfers are done between the Fleet Oilers and up to two vessels side-by-side while underway.  The Fleet Oilers provide a unique mission support to the Navies of the world.

MSC has upgraded the bridge and navigation systems with new systems and components throughout the years to maintain our compliance with the Rules and Regulations and take advantage of technology to help our mariners.  These upgrades were done through MSC’s alteration process as single system installations and were therefore not integrated with existing systems or capable of utilizing their design capabilities.  Furthermore, the installations were not uniform among the vessels or area commands.  In many cases the systems are not from the same makers.  
MSC intends to upgrade the entire bridge, which will require the removal of some systems, relocation of others, and installation of new or up to date systems.  It is intended to have a contractor develop pre-solicitation information on a number of T-AO 187 Class vessels to facilitate a comprehensive design to achieve an approved ergonomic bridge design.  Prior to the commencement of the design effort, MSC desires to capture what is presently on the T-AO 187 Class Vessels and an overview of how the new system shall be integrated.

<SOLNBR>NNL06LCT
<RESPDATE>122805

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for conceptual design of an air bag landing attenuation system for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  NASA intends to procure the CEV air bag conceptual design as a non-commercial item using FAR Part 15, and also as a Small Business Set-aside in accordance with FAR-19.502.  NASA intends to award at least one (1), but no more than two (2) air bag conceptual design contracts depending on responses received.  Results and data from the air bag conceptual design(s) will be used to evaluate the air bag landing attenuation system against alternative CEV landing attenuation system concepts as part of a trade study being conducted by NASA.  The base period of the contract(s) will be approximately 120 calendar days, and will include: (a) attending a conceptual design kick-off meeting; (b) developing the air bag landing system conceptual design including layout drawings and mass breakdowns; (c) conducting air bag performance analyses; (d) conducting a risk assessment and providing an air bag development plan; (e) administering a mid-term site visit at the Contractor’s facilities; (f) attending weekly telecons; (g) conducting a final design presentation; and (h) delivering a final report.  NASA intends to include two Not-To-Exceed (NTE) priced Options in addition to the base contract.  The Option 1 period of performance will be approximately 120 calendar days from the day the Option is exercised, and will include the design, fabrication, delivery, and testing support of sub-scale air bags for tests to be conducted at NASA/LaRC.  Option 2 period of performance will be approximately 365 calendar days from the day the Option is exercised, and will include the design, fabrication, delivery, and testing support of full-scale air bags for tests to be conducted at NASA/LaRC.  The following landing attenuation system specifications are preliminary and therefore subject to change.  The specifications are intended to depict the general performance envelope of the anticipated air bag landing attenuation system.  Specific, more-detailed performance requirements will be developed by the Government at a later date.  (1)  The landing attenuation system shall be designed for a CEV landing within a Government-controlled land range in the continental United States, but must also be suitable for off-nominal water landings associated with launch abort scenarios.  (2) The landing attenuation system shall reduce the landing loads of the CEV to within human-acceptable limits.  The human-acceptable limits will be defined by the Government at a later date.  (3) The landing attenuation system shall prevent the CEV capsule from over-turning or rolling over during or after landing.  (4) The landing attenuation system shall operate within acceptable limits for the following ranges of landing conditions: a) CEV weight of approximately 21,000 pounds; b) vertical landing velocity of approximately 22 ft/sec to 26 ft/sec; c) horizontal landing velocity of approximately 0 ft/sec to 51 ft/sec; d)  a capsule of approximately 0 to 20 degrees.  (5)  The landing attenuation system shall stow within the available volume within the CEV capsule, be capable of withstanding a space environment for an extended duration, and then be capable of being deployed during the CEV terminal descent at Earth.  The available CEV volume will be provided by NASA at a later date.  (6) The landing attenuation system shall be capable of being successfully deployed at angles-of-attack up to +/- 20 degrees during the CEV terminal descent.  (7) The landing system shall be at a state of technological readiness such that a full-scale system can be designed, fabricated, and tested before September, 2007. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,000 employees, respectively.	 All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Law School Administrative Expert to Provide Technical Assistance to Law Faculties in the Arabian Gulf Region.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region’s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have an ever-greater familiarity with commercial law.  The objective of this particular technical assistance activity is to increase the capacity of law faculties in the region to cultivate future lawyers, judges, policy makers and business people who have an adept understanding of international commercial law practices and standards. As part of an ongoing program to this end, CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to two qualified experts to provide advice regarding the administration of commercial law curricula in law schools in the Middle East.  The experts will advise on the human resource and organizational requirements for the best administration of a commercial law curriculum.

General Description of Work 

Based on in-country consultations with the deans and administrators of the participating institutions, the Contractor will provide specifically tailored advice on all issues of commercial law curriculum administration.  Specifically, but not exclusively, the experts will provide information on appropriate faculty qualifications for the relevant courses, faculty sourcing, capacity building procedures for such faculty, as well as input on crafting course descriptions and syllabus formation.  The Contractor will provide the following services to accomplish this transfer of expertise:

a.	Achieve, in cooperation with CLDP and the appropriate law faculties in the Middle East, an awareness of the latest state of development of the commercial law curricula in the institutions designated by CLDP.

b.	Based on this understanding, and prior to initial consultations in country, draft a preliminary memo on projected areas of need for designated law faculties, challenges to achieving more successful administration, and other points of interest. 

c.	Conduct meetings, in country, with appropriate law school deans and law professors of designated institutions in the Middle East in order to consult on areas of needed input and identify areas of future consultative support.

d.	Submit progress reports for each trip to the region.

e.	Participate in US based consultative visits for law school deans and professors from the designated institutions as they may arise in continuation of the technical assistance program.

The duration of the contract is from date of award through September 30, 2006, with one one-year option period.  The government reserves the right to exercise the option. The contract is expected to commence on or about January 23, 2006.  Award will be a Fixed Price contract and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Quote (RFQ).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, shall be utilized in the selection of the offer that is most advantageous to the to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS: The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Eaton Power Quality Corporation, Federal Systems & Integration Services, 8609 Six Forks Road, Raleigh, North Carolina 27615, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-3(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” to purchase specific specialized filter devices. This device will resolve the incompatibility between the Dell 2500 server and the Eaton Powerware 9125-2000 Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), used by the Social Security Administration (SSA), multiple state agency Disability Determination Service (DDS) locations, and other interested parties in support of SSA’s service delivery to the American public. There is an incompatibility issue with the Dell Power Edge 2500 and the Eaton/Powerware UPS 9125. When connected to the UPS, some Dell 2500 servers are experiencing various power issues including switching from one power source to another, multiple event log entries, constant rebooting, multiple hardware and software errors on the same device, etc. It was discovered that all of these issues were a result of these two devices working in conjunction with one another. The SSA has attempted to identify alternative sources of supply for these specialized devices by searching GSA schedules. Extensive research was conducted by the Government and both manufactures, Dell and Eaton, to find a solution. This research resulted in only one known company, Eaton, to have a filter that will resolve this incompatibility. Delivery instructions will be provided to the Eaton Corporation for their immediate disposition of the filter devices to the 1,500 SSA sites (a quantity of one (1) per site) that are using the Dell 2500 server and the Eaton Powerware 9125-2000 UPS. The Government reserves the right to require samples as early as 15 days after receipt of order (ARO). These filters may be required to be delivered as early as 30 days ARO. The product must condition the power leading to the Dell 2500 Server in such a way that the incompatibility issues stated above no longer exist. Acceptable products must be UL Listed and must contain a specialized UL label. Any responsible firm that provides specialized electronic filter devices capable of meeting or exceeding the minimum performance specifications described herein is invited to respond in writing via e-mail to: Kathleen.Cooney@SSA.GOV and Stacey.Walker@SSA.GOV no later than COB December 22, 2005. Written responses must provide clear, concise, and complete documentation indicating your company’s capability to provide the above referenced specialized filter devices. Respondents must also provide specific examples of your company’s experience in providing specialized filter devices of the type described herein with proof of existing contracts with U.S. Government facilities nationwide that allow for demonstration of your capabilities. Respondents that merely provide a potential plan for providing these filter devices will not be considered. Simple marketing information, incomplete responses, or references to vendor web sites for further information will not be considered. Pricing data is not requested or required in responses to this notice, and the Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this notice. All responses meeting these criteria will be fully considered. All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT- filter devices. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FORTHCOMING SOLICITATION. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no suitable responses are received by the cutoff date listed herein, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with Eaton Corporation. Again, all submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed herein. Faxes will not be accepted. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post an additional question and answer to the above referenced Broad Agency Announcement.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged:

Question:  The subject solicitation requires a “Summary of Cost, Deliverables, Schedule, and Milestones” in Section B.  Does this refer to the cost of the work covered in the proposal or the capital costs and annual maintenance/operations of the technology when implemented?

Answer:  In Volume I, Section B of the proposal, under “Cost, Deliverables, Schedule, and Milestones,” the offeror should provide a summary of the cost, deliverables, schedule, and milestones for the demonstration of the technology at the proposed test sites for the project.  The cost estimates are to be made for the actual work being proposed -- not cost estimates for the technology after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.   
On the other hand, in Volume I, Section C, subsection entitled “Description of Technology” of the proposal, the offeror should provide a summary of the capital costs and annual maintenance/operations costs of the technology when it is ready for implementation after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  
As stated in a previous modification to this solicitation, the assumption (about a group of three truck stops within a 50-mile circle, each with 50 parking spaces) does NOT apply to the demonstration project because it may not be practicable for all proposed test sites.  This assumption applies for the technology after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  The assumption is required for making the cost estimates so that the cost estimates for different technologies proposed by different bidders can be evaluated on the basis of a common assumption.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers to the above referenced Broad Agency Announcement:

FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
SOLICITATION NO. DTMC75-05-BAA-00001
SMART PARK

Outstanding Questions

1.	The BAA, under “Technical Approach,” requires estimates of capital and annual O&M costs.  Is it your intent that these cost estimates pertain to (1) the demonstration period, or (2) some point in the future, after the project is completed, and the technology is rolled out?

The required cost estimates should pertain to the future after the project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  

2.	The BAA, also under “Technical Approach,” directs offerors to “base estimates on these assumptions: (i) a group of three truck stops within a 50-mile circle, each with 50 parking spaces…”  Is this assumption also a requirement for the demonstration – namely, that a minimum of three truck stops, all within a 50-mile radius of each other, must be outfitted with the demonstration technology?

This assumption does NOT apply to the demonstration because it may not be practicable for all proposed test sites.  The assumption is required for making the cost estimates so that the cost estimates for different technologies proposed by different bidders can be evaluated on the basis of a common assumption.  

3.	Section 1.6 of the BAA states that USDOT “will conduct an independent evaluation of the project…”   Please provide guidance on the scope and context of the independent evaluation that you intend to conduct?

At this time, U.S. DOT has not yet determined the scope and context of the independent evaluation.  The bidder is free to propose its own evaluation; however, as mentioned in section 1.4 of the Broad Agency Announcement, FMCSA may choose to fund an entire proposal or a portion of a proposal.    

4.	Section 1.7 of the BAA states that “FMCSA is contemplating a cost-type contract, but offerors may propose an alternate contract type.”  Does FMCSA have objections to a time-and-materials contract being proposed?

Yes.        

5.	We are having difficulty confirming your allowable page count for Section C: Detailed Technical Summary of the proposal.  The total page count stipulated in the BAA for Section C is 32 pages.  However, the actual specified maximum page counts for individual sections appears to total 34 pages, as follows:

•	Description of Technology (7 pages)
•	Technical Approach (2 pages)   
•	Statement of Work (17 pages)
•	Description of Proposed Test Sites (3 pages)
•	Previous Accomplishments (3 pages)
•	Facilities and Equipment (2 pages)

On the other hand, our count of allowable pages for the entire Volume I proposal – exclusive of Appendices – seems to come to only 55 pages, rather than the 61 specified in the BAA:

•	Cover Sheet (1 page)
•	Cover Letter (1 page)
•	Table of Contents (1 page)
•	Section B: Summary of Proposal (6 pages)
•	Section C: Detailed Technical Summary (34 pages)
•	Section D: Management Approach (12 pages)

Please clarify.

What is termed “Technical Approach (2 pages)” really falls under or is a subdivision under “Description of Technology (7 pages).” In other words, “Technical Approach” is not an individual section separate from and equal to “Description of Technology.”  If two pages are needed to discuss “Technical Approach,” these two pages will be counted against the total of 7 pages for “Description of Technology.”  Consequently, the maximum page count for “Section C: Detailed Technical Summary” remains at 32 pages. 

With the maximum page count for “Section C: Detailed Technical Summary” as 32 pages, the maximum page limit for Volume I of the proposal – exclusive of appendices – should be 53 pages, rather than the 61 pages originally specified.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post the following question and answer to the above referenced Broad Agency Announcement:

Question:  The subject solicitation, section 2.5, requires an offeror who includes subcontractors to submit a subcontracting plan.  Is this plan part of Volume 2 of the proposal?  Is there a page limit for the plan?

Answer:  The required Subcontracting Plan should appear as an appendix in Volume 2 of the proposal.  There is no page limit and it will not count towards the page limit requirement.

All other terms and condition remain the same.

INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT AND LIMITED COMPETITION AWARD.  The Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 12 (SMC Det 12), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source five-year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with ATK Thiokol, Inc, Corinne, Utah for the aging surveillance (AS) of the SR118 and SR120 motors (Peacekeeper stage 1 and 3 respectively). In addition, RSLP will conduct a competition after exclusion of sources for the SR119 motor (Peacekeeper stage 2) between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet-General Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, agency’s minimum needs can be satisfied by unique services available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources.  This effort will acquire aging surveillance services for the former Peacekeeper rocket motors for Stages 1 through 3 in support of the RSLP.  The services will allow RSLP to utilize the former PK rocket motors in a variety of applications.  ATK Thiokol will provide the Aging Surveillance (AS) for the SR118 and SR120 due to ATK Thiokol’s unique capabilities as the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) and because they have provided AS for SR118, SR119, and SR120 for the last 7 years.  With regard to the SR119, RSLP will conduct a competition between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet, as these two companies have nearly the same unique capabilities.  Aerojet is the OEM and provided the AS support through 1997, and ATK Thiokol has provided AS services since 1997. Specific tasks will include providing all aspects of engineering and AS support, as required, to ensure flight worthiness on the SR118, SR119, and SR120 rocket motors and related components in support of RSLP. RSLP AS support requires the historical AS test data for all three motors in order to provide continuous trend analysis for determining the expected life of the motors and various age-sensitive components. This support includes test and analysis of the motors and components to determine 1) if there are age related trends, 2) the severity of the aging, and 3) mitigations to the effects of the aging.  For the SR119 and SR120 motors the government maintains a static fire capability and provides static fires.  For the SR118 motor the government requirement is for the contractor to maintain a static fire capability and provide static fires.  Additional support will include anomaly resolution or modification of the motor(s) related problem either identified from the AS program or due to a unique launch requirement. Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 30 days of this announcement.  Submit the SOC to Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN, 3548 Aberdeen Avenue S.E., Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, 87117-5778.  The SOC must include sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition as a prime contractor.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate its concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition to the proper channels. The ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, Phone Number (310) 363-3571. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Request for a solicitation will receive no response.  Questions pertaining to this announcement shall be directed to Contracts Manager, Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN at (505) 846-5103 or by E-mail at racelle.jensen@kirtland.af.mil, Mel Pearson, Contracting Officer, (505) 853-3503 or by Email at mel.pearson@kirtland.af.mil.

This synopsis is a commercial items acquisition and is in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in the Request for Proposal. 

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  

The evaluation factors are as follows:

	1.  Past Performance
	     a.  Reputation
	     b.  Experience
	2.  Resource Management
                 a. Resources
                 b. Staffing
	3.  Menu Cycle and Variety
	4.  Sanitation and Preventive Maintenance
	5.  Controls
	6.  Price and Portion Policies
	7.  Budget (Pro Forma) 

Proposals will be evaluated and scored on the above evaluation factors.  The factors Reputation and Experience each are one and one-half times as important to the Government in the evaluation as any other single category.  The other categories are not listed in relative order of importance.

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror who's offer conforms to the solicitation and receives the highest total point score.  The State Licensing Agency (SLA) will complete for this facility and will be selected if their proposal is in the competitive range.  In the event they are not in the competitive range and two or more offerors are tied for the highest total point score, lost will be drawn to determine which offeror will be awarded the contract.  

Solicitations are available upon request from cynthia.brown @gsa.gov.  Proposals will be due January 24, 2006, at 2:30 PM, local time, at the following location.  GSA, Bid Room 1065, 7th & D Street, SW, Washington, DC 20407. Only written request will be accepted. Notification of any change shall be made only on the FedBizOPPS.

<DESC>This replaces the original synopsis in its entirety.  The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source contract with the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Sponsored Projects, 750 Ninth Street N.W., Washington, DC 20560 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute.  See Note 22.  The most appropriate NAICS Code is 541690 with a small business size standard not to exceed $6,000,000 (Please note the original synopsis stated an incorrect NAICS Code of 541710.).  The USCG has a requirement for the operation of the National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC) and support for the USCG Ballast Water Management (BWM) program.  Pursuant to Section 1102(f) of the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-332), the USCG is required to develop and maintain a NBIC in consultation and cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution, acting through the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC).  The Smithsonian Institution has operated the NBIC since 1998 under a reimbursable agreement with the USCG.  Under NISA and its implementing regulations (33 CFR 151 Subpart D), each vessel bound for ports or places of the United States, regardless of whether a vessel operated outside the Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ), which includes the equivalent zone of Canada, is required to submit reports of BWM practices directly to the NBIC for entry into a database.  The NBIC shall provide technical support to assist the USCG in collecting, analyzing, and maintaining BWM data from vessels reported pursuant to 16 U.S.C. §4712.  The NBIC shall collect and enter the BWM data into an electronic database and summarize the status of the database and entry rate of reports. Updated electronic copies of the database shall be provided to the USCG quarterly.  The NBIC shall continue the development and maintenance of the Directory of Ballast Water Research, Control, and Treatment Technologies to provide a conduit for access to information by public and private entities.  Updates on the status of the Directory shall be provided to the USCG quarterly.  The NBIC shall assist the USCG in implementing and documenting actions necessary to correct any deficiencies highlighted as a result of the ongoing Certification & Accreditation (C&A) process for the BWM database. The NBIC shall review existing system documentation, pertinent regulations, and statutory provisions to ensure the BWM database adheres to Title III of the E-Government Act (Pub.L. 107-347) and DHS Policy Directive 4300A, Information Technology Security Program.  The NBIC shall assist the USCG in developing recommendations for input into the Risk Management System, including Risk Assessment Recommendations, Contingency Plan Recommendations, Contingency Plan Test Result Recommendations, System Security Plan Recommendations, and Security Assessment Report Recommendations.  The NBIC shall prepare a control matrix or Plan of Action and Milestones identifying the basic strategy and the control techniques implemented to contain threats, address vulnerabilities, and achieve security objectives.  The NBIC shall synthesize and analyze the data from vessels reporting BWM and provide the USCG with reports of the statistical analyses to measure patterns of compliance with ballast water management regulations, ballast water delivery and management patterns, the spatial pattern and rate of coastal marine invasions attributed to ballast water and other transfer mechanisms, and the effectiveness of BWM strategies in reducing the rate and pattern of aquatic biological invasions.  The NBIC shall, not to exceed six per month, undertake special project reports of a more sophisticated nature than the standard analyses, which shall be conducted by NBIC staff with advanced training and experience in database and statistical analyses.  The NBIC shall submit annual reports that summarize database management activities and statistical analyses by geographic location, ship type, and quarterly period.  The period of performance is six months from the date of award.  Responses may be faxed to 202-475-3905, or may be e-mailed to efeinberg@comdt.uscg.mil.

AFTAC Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities – 2 (SARC-2)


The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) has a requirement for Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities –2 (SARC-2) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Effort also includes the sustainment and installation of software for analysis and evaluation of geophysical events at seismic array stations around the world.  Additionally, contractor may be required to provide software training to host-country personnel.  

Description

Analysis and reporting of small magnitude seismic events continues to be one of the most important tasks for the United States National Data Center (USNDC) and the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  The operational software system used for analyzing and reporting events in the USNDC is not sufficiently flexible to allow the quick introduction of numerous advanced data processing techniques and the use of various cutting-edge information-presentation technologies.  Lessons learned from several previous special events show that a few key software programs used by the Research Division (TTR) geophysicist are most useful for detailed analyses of small events, and that a user-friendly interface to a specialized reporting database would streamline AFTAC’s reporting process.  

The first objective of this project is to build a suite of software for the analysis and evaluation of geophysical events.  Many of the desired analysis and evaluation techniques have already been incorporated into a research software suite known as Special Event Analysis Tools (SEAtools), developed for the TTR under previous contracts.  This software suite shall be the starting point for this effort.  As part of this effort, new analysis techniques shall be added as they are identified.  In addition, the Contractor shall help identify which portions of SEAtools will eventually have to be “operationalized” in the sense of streamlining and configuring it for optimal routine use with vetted operational settings and previously user-specified input parameters.  In addition to the development of new functionality, included under this objective is the evaluation of Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) algorithms/techniques, as applicable, for the improvement of geophysical data processing capabilities.

The second objective is to continue the development and maintenance of an event reporting tool that will extract information from AFTAC databases, and use such information to generate graphic and alphanumeric event summaries for presentation to AFTAC’s various customers via a “web-page” hosted on a classified internet Wide-Area-Network.

The third objective is to provide for installation of the SARC software suite at seismic array stations around the world for use in analyzing and evaluating geophysical events.

The fourth objective is to provide for maintenance of the software suite.  The contractor shall be responsible for traveling to foreign seismic array stations to install the SARC software and to train the host-country personnel how to use the software.  Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to a TOP SECRET/SCI is required.  TOP SECRET Facility Clearnace is required.  Storage Clearances of at least the SECRET level are required.

The contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements listed above.  Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities (SARC) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Contractor experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted SARC mission; therefore, a history of relevant work is required.  Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in performing software validation and testing in above AFTAC/TT mission area outlined above is required.

Capabilities Package

This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified small business sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more than 20 pages and should address the following specific areas:
1.	The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract.
2.	The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit.
3.	Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above.
4.	Business size/status.
The government intends to make a single award and trade off performance over price.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is contemplated with a 1-year base period and 4 one-year options (1 Oct 2006 – 30 Sep 2011).  This sources sought is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Applicable NAICS is 541511, size $21M.  The solicitation may be issued electronically on or about 10 May 2006 at www.fbo.gov.    Anticipated award date will be on or around 30 Sep 2006.

<SUBJECT>58--AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System Data Processing Group Refresh
<SOLNBR>MC2ILK060002
<RESPDATE>011306
<ARCHDATE>01202006
<CONTACT>Mr. Graham Oliff (703)432-4249 or Ms. Lee Kerr (703)432-4189.
<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command and Control (C2) Weapons and Sensors Development and Integration (MC2I), Program Manager, Radar Systems is seeking information, from industry, on the ability to produce a technical refresh to eliminate the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence issues within the currently fielded AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System Data Processing Group OL-576/TPS-59(V)3. The AN/TPS-59 (V)3 Radar System is the MAGTF’s means of detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting all Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs) within the MAGTF's area of responsibility. The primary mission of the Radar System is to provide Long-range Air Surveillance of ABTs, Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) and TBM surveillance capability.  The five primary components of the AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar system are the antenna group, the OL-576/TPS-59(!  V)3 Data Processing Group (electronics shelter), power distribution unit, SET 15 and the maintenance shelter.  The electronics shelter houses the electronics and data processing/display equipment.  Responders should provide their approach to technically refresh the Data Processing Group while, at a minimum, maintaining the current functionality of the radar system, as outlined in the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3-DELRR) (NO. CCC 11.6); ORD Change 4.  The technically refreshed AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System Data Processing Group will require connection to, and interoperability with, the current AN/TPS-59(V)3 Antenna-Transmitter Receiver Group [antenna array] including IFF antenna, Power Distribution Unit, SET 15 Equipment Group, the AN/MSQ-124 Air Defense Communications Platform (ADCP), the AN/TYQ-23(V)4 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), and the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S).   The radar must provide the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) with real-time display of all air activity and must be rugged enough to support a wide range of operations in all types of weather and terrain conditions. The Radar System must pro!  vide Antiair Warfare (AAW) units of the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) with sufficient advanced warning and target information to allow for threat evaluation and responsive action, including air raid warning of targeted forces and neutralization of the threat. The Radar System must provide air controllers with a precise air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions; with integrated Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), Identification Friend or Foe, Mark XII/XIIA System (AIMS) Interrogator, Cryptographic and ancillary equipment; with all Electronic Counter-Counter Measure (ECCM) capabilities and performance; with interface to the decoy for electronic protection; and two air controller positions to conduct GCI from the Data Processing Group shelter.  In support of ABTs and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) operations, the radar must have the capability, in the interim, to!   disseminate TBM target information to the ADCP as well as ABT and TBM  target data to the TAOM. Additionally, the radar must have the ability to disseminate all ABT and TBM information to the CAC2S through the use of open architecture, to include interoperability with Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), Composite Tracking Network (CTN) and Netted Sensors for dissemination to all air defense agencies (Marine Corps and Joint Services) and Surface to Air Missile (SAM) firing batteries (Marine Corps and Joint Services) by way of a common digital data link, standard cryptographic equipment and open architecture. The mature system must provide target information to the Marine Corps SAM system and accept cues from external sensors. The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System must contribute to the MAGTF’s ability to integrate air defense assets, both within the Marine Corps and across a joint interface. In support of its TMD role, the updated Data Processing Group must also improve on target processing capability, detection and tracking, and survivability. All !  intraoperability/interoperability to external systems must be via secure cryptographic data links; embedded and/or appliqué cryptographic devices are preferred.  Responders should provide their approach to migrating the existing software, hardware, and firmware to an open architecture, and address information security considerations.  Maximum use of advanced technology in the Data Processing Group design is highly encouraged for maximum benefit of producing a complete system that meets or exceeds the requirements outlined in the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3-DELRR) (NO. CCC 11.6); ORD Change 4.  Responders should address their approach to the utilization of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware in the Data Processing Group shelter.  The use of items from the Marine Corps Common Hardware Suite (MCHS) is required if qualified processors exist within the MCHS. Information Assurance (IA), including testing and certification(s), must be addressed and per!  formed, with the accreditation boundary to include the entire AN/TPS-5 9(V)3 Radar System; the contractor will update the System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA), accordingly. In addition, respondents should address all changes to the cooling and power requirements for the control shelter.  The logistical footprint of the Data Processing Group shelter must meet a threshold of the existing S-280 shelter and an objective of an S-788/G shelter or smaller, while maintaining the performance outlined in the 3-DELRR ORD. The respondent should address supportability considerations in the design and development of the upgraded Data Processing Group, to include complete support for sustainment throughout the life of the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System. The refreshed Data Processing Group will use the same organizational to depot level maintenance concept as the current Data Processing Group shelter.  In presenting the maintenance and support philosophy, responders should address reduction of obsolescence and DMS; extend the life cycle of the radar; pro!  pose Total Ownership Cost Reduction (TOCR) initiatives.  The responders should describe how Performance Monitoring/Fault Location (PM/FL) software will be rewritten to detect, identify and locate faults within the refreshed Data Processing Group shelter along with legacy components. Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and maintenance concepts that reduce the amount of life cycle cost to the using unit should be addressed and included in the overall design of the system. Of particular interest are support concepts that will improve Mean Logistics Delay Time to the Fleet and minimize the government’s risks associated with future DMS issues. After initial fielding of the refreshed Data Processing Group a business case analysis will be performed and a separate life cycle sustainment contract may be awarded. Supportability considerations should also address seabased logistics and integrated data environment capabilities. This effort will provide a technology refresh for the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Data Processing Group to eliminate existing DMS and obsolescence issues while maintaining current system performance requirements.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated. The contract for the technology refresh will be performed in phases.  Testing will be performed on a first article before full rate production will be procured. Respondents are requested to submit their approach to refresh the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Data Processing Group.  The submission should address the specific engineering and logistic considerations identified in this RFI.  In addition, respondents should provide an estimated cost for completion of eleven Data Processing Group environments and should provide a projected delivery schedule. Any information that may be proprietary in regards to software code, firmware and hardware should be identified in the response.  Contractors are invited to read (only) the 3-DELRR ORD, Change 4 and the AN/TPS-59(V)3 System Specification at Anteon Corporation (16 Center St. Suite 109, Stafford, Virginia 22556) by coordinating a visit request in advance with Mr. Richard Speight at (540) 288-3144. Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Graham Oliff Jr, by 13 January 2006. Please submit all information to Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Comman!  d, Attn: A/C Contracts/Mr. Graham Oliff Jr., 2200 Lester St., Quantico, VA 22134-6050. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

See Numbered Note 1  STATEMENT OF WORK   GENERAL CBP has been tasked with stemming the flow of illegal aliens & narcotics across our nation’s borders, including land, air or seaports of entry.  To assist in accomplishing this mission, CBP has successfully utilized trained canines.  Occasionally, these canines need to be replaced due to injury, disease, age or death; or there are additional mission requirements.  The successful contractor(s) is expected to supply canines IAW the specific requirements indicated below: REQUIREMENTS The requirements of this agency for replacement canines are: Breeds – Either Belgian Malinois or Dutch Shepherds are acceptable.  German Shepherds & Belgian herding breeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Government.  a.  Lineage – The canine shall be European born or of European lineage traceable by 2 generations.  Proof of lineage shall be provided w/each delivery.  The absence of proper documentation will be grounds for rejecting a canine.  American-bred canines may be accepted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Government. b. Age – The canine shall have a documented age between 12 & 38 months. c.  Weight – The canine shall weigh no less than 45 lbs nor more than 90 lbs. d.  Size – The Canine shall measure not less than 22” nor more than 30” at the shoulder. e. SEX – The canine may be either male or female. SELECTION CRITERIA  The NCF in El Paso, TX will administer a series of tests on the canine to determine whether it has the capability of working in a Border Patrol environment.  The canine is required to pass these tests in order to be accepted in the canine training program.  
SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS  A detection canine candidate shall exhibit an obsession to play w/objects, have stable character, be gun-sure & willing to surmount difficult obstacles.  The canine should prefer to play with objects more then having food, water, or the attention of its handler.  No commands will be given for the canine to retrieve.  Listed below are several tests that provide insight into a candidate’s suitability as a detection canine.  All tests will be performed at the NCF.  A.  Stable Character Test – The canine will be brought around several people to judge how it responds.  It should not be afraid or act aggressively toward anyone who approaches it.  A happy, social attitude should be seen in its behavior.  The canine will be walked on smooth tile floors to see if it is sure-footed.  The canine should display no fear or discomfort.  While the canine is standing or walking on leash in a passive state, an umbrella will be opened suddenly in its face.  The canine may show a slight startled reaction but should recover quickly.  The canine will be tested for gun sureness with several unusually loud gunshots fired from about 50’ behind it in which the canine should show little or no reaction.  The canine will be taken into tight places to see how it responds.  It should confidently enter & investigate these areas without hesitation.  In addition to the above tests, a search of a vehicle w/ the engine running may be performed at the discretion of the Gov’t.  b.  Retrieve/Prey Drive Test – The canine will be evaluated to see if it will pursue not only objects it is familiar with, but also strange, hard and soft objects.  This test will be conducted in a ravine or on a hill.  The canine, handler, & evaluator will stand downhill & the handler will throw each object uphill & out-of-sight.  With each object, the canine will be held on-line & will be released with no command.  One by one, several objects, familiar & strange, will be thrown uphill for the canine to pursue.  The canine will be judged on its alertness, speed, hunt & grade of each object.  The purpose is to determine if the canine will hunt for & play w/strange objects while being physically stressed.  Examples of strange objects are:  a piece of PVC pipe, a block of wood, a piece of metal pipe, etc.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1.  Alertness – The canine should show undistracted interest when presented with each object & pull hard against the leash as the object is being thrown. 2.  Speed – Upon being released, the canine should demonstrate extreme physical effort in running to the area where the object fell.  3.  Hunt – Upon reaching the area, the canine must show effective use of its olfactory senses in locating the object. 4.  Grab – Upon locating the object, the canine should immediately grab it in its mouth & show a desire & satisfaction in playing with the object.  C.  Perseverance Test – The canine will be pre-stimulated w/ an object that will then be placed under a heavy object (cement block, tire, etc.). The canine will then be released.  The canine will be evaluated on its drive & desire to work out the problem & obtain the object.  The purpose is to determine whether the canine possesses a sufficient desire to work to obtain the object & to determine the canine’s natural indication behavior (passive/aggressive).  Ideal behavior for this test is, upon reaching the location of the object, the canine immediately engages in frantic biting & scratching behavior in an effort to dig and obtain the object, or a frozen stare at the location of the object.  D.  Water Conflict Test – After the retrieve/prey test, the canine will be taken to a location where there will be a small pond, stream or container of water.  The canine will be shown the water & pre-stimulated with the object that will be thrown beyond the water.  The canine will then be released.  The ideal behavior is that the canine goes directly to the object without stopping to take a drink.  E.  Food Conflict Test – A test similar to the water conflict will be conducted with food.  The canine will be pre-stimulated with the object that is then thrown downwind of the food.  The canine will then be released.  The desired behavior is that the canine disregards the food & pursues the object.  
F.  Handler/Object Conflict Test – The canine will be brought to a location where there will be a 6’ high chain link fence or an overturned milk crate or like item.  The canine will be pre-stimulated w/ an object that will be placed behind the fence or under the milk crate.  The canine will then be released & the handler will walk out of sight.  The canine should go to the object, show keen interest & remain unaffected by the absence of the handler.  G.  Hunt Drive Test – The canine will be brought to a location where there will be a high degree of grass or brush.  The canine will be pre-stimulated w/ an object which will be thrown deep (over 40 yards) into the grass or rush.  The purpose is to determine the level of the canine’s hardness in pushing through the brush & if the canine will search for an extended period of time without losing interest.  The ideal behavior for this test is that the canine crash through the brush w/ maximum physical effort.  Once in the brush, the canine must exhibit concentrated & frantic hunting behavior utilizing its olfactory senses.  The canine is expected to maintain this behavior for an extended period (4 to 5 minutes) without any assistance from the handler until such time as it locates the object.  Upon locating the object, the canine should immediately grab the object in its mouth & demonstrate satisfaction in playing with it.  H.  On-Line Search Test – The canine will be brought to a search area (shelves, vehicles, building, etc.).  The canine will then be pre-stimulated with an object that will be placed out of sight in the search area at a location above ground level.  The canine will then be directed through a systematic search of the area on a leash.  Included in this search will be several areas above waist level.  The purpose is to determine the degree of trainability & handler sensitivity in the canine.  Ideal behavior for this test is that the canine will follow all directional commands & signals made by the handler.  The canine must demonstrate effective use of its olfactory senses in searching the area where it is directed.  Upon reaching the hidden object, the canine should show quick recognition of the object’s odor & display an undistracted desire to follow this odor and obtain the object.  TEMPERAMENT AND GENETIC DRIVES  Throughout the selection phase, the canine must show that is possesses the temperament and genetic drives to work within a Border Patrol environment based on the following criteria:  a.  Socialization – The canine must possess a sound temperament that will allow it to be approached by & work around groups of people without showing fear, distraction, or reacting aggressively.  b.  Courage/ Confidence – The canine must display lack of fear & not be distracted by the following situations and environments:  1.  Unsure footing (slick floors, rubble, etc.);  2. Tightly enclosed spaces;  3.  Moving vehicles;  4.  Loud noises (weapons fire, etc.); 5.  Other live animals & their odors; & 6.  Startling situations (unforeseen events which the canine perceives a danger).  c.  Drives – The canine shall possess, in varying degrees, the following genetic drives (drives are defined as subconscious impulses to read to stimuli): 1.  Hunt – (high degree required) – The drive to search for thrown objects utilizing all senses.  2.  Air Scent – (high degree required) – The drive to use its olfactory capability to search for and locate thrown or hidden objects.  3.  Prey – (required in the absence of retrieve) – The drive to chase, pick up & play with all thrown objects (hard or soft).  4.  Retrieve – (required in the absence of prey) – The drive to bring thrown object back to the handler.  5.  Activity – (some degree required) – The drive to be constantly in motion, engaged in activity & possessing abundant energy (commonly referred to as “hyper”).  6.  Trainability – (some degree required) – Happily and willingly follows handler directions.  REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION  The following documentation shall accompany the canine at the time of delivery:  a.

Attached:  Statement of Work:  Transport NPS Fundamentals II Participants from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, Phoenix, AZ to Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, AZ and Return BACKGROUND  The National Park Service's (NPS) Horace M. Albright Training Center, hereafter referred to as the "Center," located on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, offers introductory training to approximately 700 new employees annually.  Up to 56 trainees are on site during a training cycle (i.e., two courses that run concurrently).  Participants fly into Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and are transported to the Center, returning to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport two weeks later.  Currently, participants pick up rental vans at the airport and carpool to the Center, reversing the process once the class has ended.  This practice is not cost-effective.  This practice also puts employees at risk, as participants are already weary when they begin their four-hour drive to the Grand Canyon, and may lack experience in driving larger vehicles or dealing with inclement weather typical of the Southwest (e.g., dust storms, monsoons, snow and ice).   PURPOSE This scope of work requests quotations for transporting participants from the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to the Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, and return, for the nine remaining courses of the year (February - August, 2006).  It should be noted that due to fiscal constraints, the course schedule may be reduced with minimal notice.  SPECIFICATIONS 1)	Quotes shall be based on two round-trips per course.  There are approximately two courses per month.  The current (pending) course schedule is attached.    2)	The Contractor shall provide quotes on each individual course, not on the season (e.g., the nine courses).    3)	The schedule shall provide for two pickup times at the airport, one at 1:00 p.m. and one at 4:00 p.m.  Pickups shall be made at each of the four Sky Harbor terminals.  The Contractor shall propose a schedule for the terminal pickups, and designate a pickup location in their quote.  For the return trip from the Center to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the Contractor shall schedule two pickup times at the Center, one at 5:00 a.m. and one at 7:00 a.m.  There is only one pick-up point at the Center.  4)	A number of participants drive private vehicles to the Center, reducing the number of participants needing transportation from the Contractor.  The NPS will supply an approximate number of riders three days prior to the pick-up day.  The Contractor shall provide a cost estimate for using full-capacity buses and a cost estimate for using smaller vehicles (e.g., vans) when fewer riders are expected.  5)	Buses (or vans) must accommodate participants and their luggage.  Vehicles will stop twice northbound and twice southbound.  Each stop will last 15 minutes, and occur at the Interstate rest stop on I-40 between Flagstaff and Williams, and at the Interstate rest area on I-17 north of Phoenix.     6)	The Contractor shall provide a point of contact and a contact number on travel days, including direct contact with the driver(s).  This will enable the NPS to keep drivers informed of late arrivals and/or cancellations who will not need to be picked up.   SCHEDULE Pick-up at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Drop-off at the Albright Training Center	 1) 2/27/2006 2) 3/13/2006 3) 4/3/2006 4) 5/1/2006 5) 5/15/2006 6) 6/5/2006 7) 6/19/2006 8) 7/17/2006 9) 7/31/2006 Pick-up at the Albright Training Center and Drop-off at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport 1) 3/10/2006 2) 3/24/2006 3) 4/14/2006 4) 5/12/2006 5) 5/26/2006 6) 6/16/2006 7) 6/30/2006 8) 7/28/2006 9) 8/11/2006 The Contractor must strictly adhere to the schedule and shall notify the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) immediately should the driver of the vehicle be late, and provide the reason why the vehicle is late and when service is expected to resume/begin. VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS The vehicle(s) provided must be dependable, in good working condition as applicable, and capable of accommodating all participants and their luggage.   All vehicles used by the Contractor must be appropriately registered, licensed and insured as required by Federal, State and Local Government for the type of service to be performed. DRIVER REQUIREMENTS A driver will be assigned to the route and must be licensed to operate a vehicle of this type specified herein in the state of Arizona. At all times during the performance of the contract and until completion of the performance period, the Contractor shall provide a driver who is competent, safe, and dependable. Periodically, the COTR may require the driver of the vehicle to check verification of Government employees riding in the vehicle. DOWNTIME When any vehicle regularly used in the performance of this contract is out of service for any reason, the vehicle will be replaced by the Contractor with a vehicle of the same or similar specifications as the inoperable vehicle.  Inoperative vehicles shall be replaced by the Contractor within a reasonable amount of time.  The vehicle will not be considered back in service until the Contractor officially notifies the COTR.  If the Contractor fails to repair or replace the inoperative vehicle, the NPS, at its option, may elect to secure a replacement vehicle from other sources, without regard or consideration of the reasons that caused the downtime.  The Contractor will be assessed the cost incurred by the NPS in securing the replacement vehicle. The Contractor will notify the COTR by telephone of any breakdown and the estimated time in which a replacement vehicle will arrive. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The period of performance of this contract will commence February 1, 2006, depending upon availability of appropriated funds, and continue through August 31, 2006. NPS ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 1)	The COTR shall provide a list of riders three days in advance of the pick-up date.  2)	The COTR shall notify the contractor no later than three days ahead of the pick-up date in case of cancellation.  3)	The NPS shall provide a point of contact (COTR).  This individual will be stationed at the following address:  	 Horace M. Albright Training Center #1 Albright Ave.  P.O. Box 477 Grand Canyon, AZ  86023

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Solicitation Number HSCG40-06-Q-40486
          
             Briefly Explain: USCG Yard currently owns a Dynamometer for testing Paxman engines which was manufactured by the Kahn Company. In the past six months or so the Yard has experienced multiple problems as a result of the Dynamometer Power Module failures. The Yard have suggested an upgraded Power Module. The new Power Module will eliminate the reoccurring problems. Since the Dynamometer was manufactured by the Kahn Company they are the only company able to provide the new Power Module due to proprietary drawings, engineering data, patents, and copyrights. Due to the initial investment for the entire Dynamometer it would not be cost effective to replace the entire unit at this time for the failing Power Module. The estimated replacement for the entire unit including installation would be five to six hundred thousand dollars plus up to a year or more of downtime.
